1,[Director] Fukunaga's startlingly impressive first feature is almost ruthless in its depiction of the brutality and degradation confronting the hidden hordes that cross rivers and hop trains trying to get to the United States.
1,Cary Fukunaga makes an impressive feature directing debut with the lacerating immigration tale Sin Nombre.
1,"The compositions (even in grimy cities) and use of color are wonderful, the kind of thing that can only arise with the assistance of a wonderful art director."
1,Rich details make the immigration thriller Sin Nombre vivid and haunting.
0,"As accomplished as Sin Nombre is in many ways, you're always aware of the ever-tightening plot screws, rather than the human beings caught in one threatening situation after another."
1,"It gives a caravan of migrants human faces, compelling motivations and dramatic challenges that transcend borders."
1,"Sin Nombre is at once subtle and intense, familiar but refreshing, intimate even as it tells a story untold numbers have endured."
1,"Above all, Fukunaga has great respect for his characters and their story."
0,Intense Spanish-language feature debut intrigues but doesn't quite gel.
1,"Brutal, wrenching and filled with desperation and meanness, Sin Nombre signals a major new talent in writer-director Cary Fukunaga, who never flinches while telling a story so grim and sad it moves beyond tears to numbness."
1,"You might think you know where these characters are going, and how the various plot threads will be tied up. But you'd be wrong."
1,"A very southern modern Western, the Spanish-language Sin Nombre offers a treacherous frontier, a conflicted outlaw and fine performances by actors with whom the camera clearly is besotted."
1,"The film's beauty, which is meant to suggest the dreams of the characters, is another crucial aspect of Sin Nombre's complexity."
1,"Despite the unevenness of the ride, however, the memory of Sin Nombre is indelible."
1,steadily building intensity despite overwhelming feelings of doom
1,"Sin Nombre marks an impressive feature-film debut for Cary Joji Fukunaga, albeit more as a director than a writer."
1,"Sayra and her family are the poor, huddled masses our founders were talking about, and it's painfully bracing to watch them crushed beneath the promise of a stocked cupboard and living wage."
0,Sincere and sympathetic but also mostly inert.
1,Imagine City of God without the zippy camerawork or Slumdog Millionaire without the millionaire and you get the feel of Sin Nombre.
1,This sense of equilibrium even carries over to Fukunaga's crafty integration of professional and nonpro actors.
0,"Fukunaga's intentions may be honorable, but films like Sin Nombre exploit their subjects as much as they empathize with them."
1,"Fukunaga paints better outside the lines, working with cinematographer Adriano Goldman to offer vivid shots of the poverty and despair cutting through Latin America."
1,Sin Nombre is pure filmmaking: a great story told in beautiful images.
1,"It's a documentary-style look at the harrowing journey illegal immigrants take to get into this country, but it's also a tightly plotted thriller."
1,"The actors, particularly Flores, have a documentary reality about them. Their reactions to most of their predicaments, even the ones given away too easily by the script, are real in the most human sense."
1,"I only wish Fukunaga was as good a writer as he is a director -- but as this is his debut feature, I'll cut some slack on that score."
1,"[Director Fukunaga] spends as little time dwelling on the whole as possible, instead opting for a classic road-trip story of the parts: the people who are emigrating and the gang members trying to kill one of them."
1,"A confident, raw feature film that continually surprises and repeatedly devastates. Sin Nombre is an outstanding motion picture."
1,"While this Mexican import is treading familiar territory, first time writer/director Cary Fukunaga comes at it with fresh eyes."
1,What makes it unique among films that cover similar subject matter is the restrained acting and richness of its visual sense.
1,This is a very fine film debut.
1,"The movie, which has both bloody violence and tender romance, will remind you of ""City of God"" meets ""Under the Same Moon."" It is another shining example of the best that independent filmmaking has to offer, much like last year's ""Frozen River."""
1,"This is a vivid portrait of the landscape of the Americas, picking apart every step of the migrant's journey"
1,Captivatingly naturalistic performances and cinematography almost makes up for the lack of a larger political framework.
1,"It's a tribute to the visceral impact of the staging that the film retains its grip despite becoming somewhat predictable, while thematically it's the usual cycle-of-violence hand wringing."
1,"Sin Nombre is a spry, humane account of the hardships encountered on the Mexican immigration trail, whose violence never feels exploitative, for all that it may be hard to watch. Highly recommended."
0,"For all its formal 챕lan and gritty location shooting, Sin Nombre is a wearily hollow, morally specious movie."
0,"If you've ever got your hands on a second-hand set of Operation, you'll know how it feels to watch the latest addition to the slum drama stable. Most parts are present and correct, but there's definitely something missing - a heart, perhaps?"
1,"Likely to be one of the must-see foreign language titles of the year, opening our eyes to a world of desperation, hope and pain."
1,It's a tough watch. It's also one of the best films of the year.
1,"It's the scenes of immigrants heading north atop moving trains which resonate the most - a testament to Adriano Goldman's brilliant, expansive cinematography."
1,"The rules of the gang are spurious enough to make us realise that this isn't a world of good against evil, it's a world of adolescents who've got no reason to grow up."
1,There is enough freshness in the documentary-style observation to make up for any lack of imagination in the storyline.
1,"The movie never quite determines if it is docudrama or melodrama, though each, at times, shines strongly."
1,"A striking, and often quite gruelling, account of survival and flight in poverty-stricken Central America."
1,There is the feel of a Sam Peckinpah western to a grimly predictable story that blends beautiful scenery with brutal reality.
1,"As vibrantly coloured and in-your-face visceral as you'd expect: a woozy, punch-out shot makes you feel like it's your own head hitting the dirt."
1,"The film will linger in the mind long after its devastating conclusion. You leave the cinema breathless and disquieted but also with a sense of having had something important revealed to you. In a very strong field, this is the year's best film so far."
1,A hard-hitting tragi-masterpiece that jolts from tender sentimentality to gritty real-life violence .
1,Sin Nombre is a riveting watch and an expertly directed drama that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.
1,"Gorgeously shot and edited, and performed with a gentle emotional openness, this gritty odyssey tells a deeply personal story while examining much bigger issues in Central America and beyond."
1,It's such an accomplished and powerful piece of storytelling that Sin Nombre - which means Nameless - could easily find itself in the running for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award.
0,Basically a manipulative thriller with social-commentary aspirations
1,An epic and stunningly shot thriller about two young people crossing the gauntlet of Central America in their attempt to get to the USA.
1,"Cary Fukunaga makes a strong impression with his debut feature, a visually rich Spanish-language thriller which borrows the conventions of the western and applies them to a world of gang brotherhoods and travelling immigrants in Mexico."
1,"The gangster part of the movie is riddled with cliches, but strikes gold with its depiction of immigrants on a train headed north. An excellent debut by a Japanese-American director."
0,full review at Movies for the Masses
1,"Spellbinding and nailbiting at the same time, ""Sin Nombre?s"" climax chillingly evokes the fable of the rabbit crossing the river on the crocodile?s back. Even amid such fleeting hope, its bone-deep fragility proved impossible to shake."
1,"It's a drama, a romance and a thriller, but make no mistake - Sin Nombre pulls no punches in delivery a raw, powerful film that shrugs aside genre convention."
1,Fukunaga wastes no time with laborious explanations for his characters' motives.
1,
1,
1,"[F]or all its raw simplicity, the film manages to conjure a veritable library of references."
0,Sin Nombre still leaves an acrid aftertaste.
1,"If you want to learn about the nameless people behind the headlines, Sin Nombre is the best place to start."
1,"Eloquent, elegant and utterly heartbreaking, Sin Nombre is one of the most exciting pieces of cinema we've seen in a long time."
1,"The exotic setting and strong performances go a long way toward distinguishing Sin Nombre, even if the story itself can feel anemic."
0,"More aptly titled Sexually Desirable When Drugged, the movie features slumbering sex slaves in what seems like a necrophiliacs brothel for grumpy old men, and nothing less than a romanticized and lusty aesthetic portrayal of date rape."
1,"A meditation on life, death, sex, revenge, religion and peace that is involving despite its ponderous pace."
1,"Steeped in European sensibilities, ""House of the Sleeping Beauties"" is a melancholy diary of human frailty juxtaposed against a fuzzy palate of artistic exploitation."
0,"Telling what amounts to a rather simple story, Glowna puffs up his exposition with quotes from Chinese poetry, rounds of heavy-handed symbolism and experiments in multiple narration."
1,"Despite the fact that its premise sounds like it was dreamed up by a pervert who depends on that date rape drug for a social life, this macabre molestation mystery proves to be easy to swallow."
0,"A meandering, self-indulgent rumination on old age, death and unfulfillable desire, German actor-director Vadim Glowna's adaptation of Yasunari Kawabata's surreal, ironic short story gets everything but the surrealism and irony right."
0,One of the year's worst releases.
0,a turgid porn fantasy tale for depressed old men
0,"If ever there was a paradigm of insufferable European art-house pretentiousness, this is it."
1,"Sure, there's copious full-frontal female nudity and an aroused male body part, but such scenes are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. There's a subtle difference, but still a difference."
0,"It's easy to feel as drowsy as any of the titular ladies while watching this misogynistic, soporific contemplation of old age, mortality and T&A."
1,...keeps things moving even when there is actually little going on besides morbid ruminations and deep drifts of sleep.
0,Not even the august presence of Maximilian Schell can dispel the odor of fusty smut that clings to House of the Sleeping Beauties.
0,"Based on an acclaimed novella by Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata, the film is one of those self-consciously atmospheric literary adaptations that suffer from a surfeit of symbolism and pretentiousness."
0,"With the mounting number of first-rate foreign-language films locked out of movie theaters due to wary distributors, it's worth pondering why such laughable dreck as German director Vadim Glowna's House of the Sleeping Beauties actually made it through."
0,"Do you find this premise anything but repugnant? It offends not only civilized members of both sexes, but even dirty old men, dramatizing as it does their dirtiness and oldness."
0,Most bad movies are simply forgettable. But some bad movies are so amazingly wrong that you feel compelled to gawk at them.
0,"Glowna presents this smoky German feature as an elegy for lost youth, but it's so tumescent with male self-pity that I couldn't wait for it to end."
1,"These elemental forces fuel a compelling narrative, but the second half of the movie starts to drift."
1,"Ultimately, though, the story is defined by searing turns from the enjoyably crotchety Burstyn and Horne, who shepherds Hagar from prideful wild child to soul-sapped middle-aged mother."
0,"There is a reverence for the idea of Laurence's book but ultimately, in spite of its spiced-up sex scenes, it's much tamer and more conventional."
1,...there's certainly no overlooking the palpable emotional punch of the movie's final scenes.
1,Ellen Burstyn deserves another Oscar nomination for this compelling drama.
0,Events pass by in a muddled rush as the intimate character study of the page gives way to a hollowed-out on screen portrait.
1,A stubbornly affecting drama that's strongest in its quieter moments.
0,"Despite a terrific lead performance by Ellen Burstyn, Kari Skogland's epic The Stone Angel is a lesson in the perils of trying to cram a hefty Canadian novel that spans decades into a movie running just under two hours."
1,"Writer-director Kari Skogland adapts a beloved Canadian novel gracefully and with plenty of spunk, the same way its main character moves through the world from cradle to grave."
0,"Although talented newcomer Christine Horne is ideal as the younger Hagar, letting Burstyn play the character at around 50, despite best-effort lighting, was not the wisest choice."
1,"Old lady on the road takes a memory trip, giving Burstyn a chance to shine."
1,"It's not a great movie, but Burstyn fans shouldn't miss her subtle performance."
0,"Overacted, underwritten, and with flashback cues so lazy the characters may as well just say, ""I remember when...,"" the film feels like The Notebook II."
0,A film of tightly assembled bits and pieces that don't fit comfortably together despite clever dashes of magical realism connecting past and present.
0,"Far less would have been much more, though the geriatric protagonist's salty sexual wit and impulse to share a joint with a passing stranger, spice up the often dreary chronological procession of family episodes."
0,The only way to enjoy Kari Skogland's epic portrait of a miserable 90-year- woman named Hagar (Ellen Burstyn) is to reframe it as Scary Movie for weepies.
0,"Left me feeling respectfully indifferent, as if I'd been served a nutritious meal that was only fleetingly satisfying."
0,"A perfectly respectable, solidly-made film which, beyond the expert performance by the always reliable Ellen Burstyn, has unfortunately little to recommend it."
0,
1,"A tastefully reverent, fundamentally sincere treatment of Margaret Laurence's 1964 Manitoba-based novel, a staple for Canada's 12th graders."
0,"Too much story, too little time"
0,
1,"Watching The Stone Angel is not a chore. And the ending is pure, classy melodrama-it's totally overblown, and nothing less than satisfying."
0,"For my taste, everything about The Stone Angel is too nailed-down and on-the-nose."
1,"Miss Burstyn is the Oscar winner, and Juno star Ellen Page is getting billing beyond her screen time as the girlfriend of one of Hagar's sons, but it's newcomer Miss Horne's performance that gives the movie its soul."
0,What we're offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.
0,"The Squeakquel is painfully high-pitched. It reaches frequencies that could make bats plummet from the sky, clutching at their little ears in agony. It's as if a mosquito equipped with a power tool is attempting to drill its way through your eardrum."
0,"The Squeakquel is astonishingly high-pitched, like 100 helium balloons being let off in your head. A caveat, then: dogs may pick up on subtleties I've missed."
1,"The film never tries too hard to be cool, features adorable rodents in fetching knitwear, and includes helium-voiced chipmunks shaking their tushes as they cover Beyonce songs. Just great."
1,"Even if there's little here for older viewers to enjoy, youngsters will love the slapstick action and catchy soundtrack."
0,"The world's most irritatingly high-pitched rodents are back and noisier than ever, in this lobotomised rip-off of the High School Musical franchise."
0,"With an unengaging plot, flat jokes and shameless product placement, Alvin is a late contender for worst film of the year."
0,"Three digimated rodents play guitar, go to school and create merry hell, all for the benefit of the ""holiday season"" audiences that made the original Chipmunks movie a ""global phenomenon"" to the tune of 350m. That's not phenomenal - that's criminal."
0,Funnniest moment? The loud snores from a fellow critic at the press preview.
0,A disappointing sequel with painfully few laughs.
0,"There are plenty of lame pop-culture references to Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver, should any losing-the-will-to-live parents need a final push over the edge."
1,"Alvin, Simon and Theodore deal with the pressures of high school in this modest, family-friendly upgrade from the singing-and-dancing chipmunks' muddled debut feature."
1,A frenetic but undeniably funny follow-up that offers twice the number of singing-and-dancing rodents in another seamless blend of CGI and live-action elements.
0,Ross Bagdasarian's enduring characters are a bit tougher to endure in this charmless sequel.
1,"It's not all quite as absurdly endearing as the first film was, but it's still pretty darn cute, and almost entirely inoffensive, certainly as kids' movies go."
0,Surely this qualifies as cruelty to humans.
0,"Non-discriminating little kids will squeal with delight, but don't expect them to learn anything other than the phrases ""Dutch oven"" and ""pole-dancing."""
0,"Despite its success as a babysitter for preschoolers, it's a not a very good film."
0,"Watching talented, funny people like Zachary Levi, David Cross and Wendie Malick go from one demeaning and painfully stupid situation to the next is excruciating."
0,The earlier Alvin movie made more than $217 million just in the United States. It's hard to imagine this somewhat confused sequel doing as well.
1,Its young target audience will find this latest Chipmunks iteration entertaining. The story is simple enough for little kids to follow and at 88 minutes the movie does not wear out its welcome.
0,[It] could be the most aggressively terrible movie of the year.
1,Thomas brings a light campy touch as she did in 1995's The Brady Bunch Movie.
0,Little kids will love it. You'll need a hazmat suit.
1,"If the Chipmunks don't make you smile, you're nuts."
0,It seems as if no professional actors were hired in the making of this motion picture.
0,"Isn't much worse than the original, but unfortunately it's no better."
0,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel offers exactly two big laughs for its kiddo target audience -- one involves passing gas, the other a shot to the crotch."
1,"There's a lot of parents that will roll their eyes at this movie. However, it is very cute if you can get in the spirit of the movie, and kids are going to love it."
0,"Instead of paying for celebrity voices that are rendered unrecognizable, why not pay for better writers?"
0,"Being aimed at children isn't a valid excuse for a movie to be simple-minded and illogical. You know that, right?"
0,Parental Content Review
1,"Not so much good as it is low-key, amusing, and painless."
0,The story is so paper-thin one surmises it was scrawled on soggy toilet paper somewhere
0,"Whatever limited charms the first version had -- mostly David Cross' portrayal of Ian, the greedy manager who exploits the furry creatures -- have since soured."
0,Will kids eat up this cutely fractious claptrap? Of course they will. They'll eat up whatever you put in front of them. But that doesn't make The Squeakquel good for them.
0,"Betty Thomas delivers pretty much the bare minimum: peppy, brightly colored, tune-filled nonsense sure to meet the low, low standards of its pre-kindergarten core audience."
1,"A surprising array of stars play the helium voiced sextet, safe in the knowledge that noone is going to be offended by this charming chipmunk squeakquel."
0,"As tedious as it is inevitable, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel is as ho-ho-hum as can be."
1,"An oddly entertaining, if mindless, way to spend an hour and a half on a Saturday morning with a seven-year-old."
0,"Every time an adult ended up in traction or broke wind, the three-year-olds in the audience were freshly ecstatic."
0,"Whatever slim charms there were in the nostalgic, musically cute and slapstick-friendly first film of chipmunk mania are squished right out of The Squeakquel like so much rodent roadkill."
0,"""Alvin & the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is pure cinematic poison from start to finish and does roughly for holiday moviegoing what Irving Mainway's Bag O'Glass once did for holiday gift-giving."
1,It's one that will keep little moviegoers happy without driving their parents too squirrelly.
0,"It's not entirely Thomas's fault: What are you going to do with those fat-cheeked, helium-voiced singing critters but slap together enough ""awwww"" moments to make the toddlers happy and enough knowing winks to keep parental bums in the seats?"
0,"Perfunctorily cute, the only selling points of this squeakuel are its seamless mix of CGI and live-action, and that it goes by in a flash."
0,"At one point, Cross's character takes a full-frontal hit in the groin from an errant toy motorcycle."
0,"The slapstick required of everyone, animals or not, will exhaust even parents who remember the Chipmunks' original hits."
0,"It's mildly amusing and the climax is pretty exciting but, all in all, I'm not sure the Squeakquel was strictly necessary."
0,The whole thing is rather insipid. But Thomas makes it smoother and more palatable than it deserves to be.
0,"The Chipmunks are as cute as ever here, but the plot is almost insultingly predictable, even for the youngest of viewers."
0,"The Chipmunks, in the first film, were the mathematical creations of a computer; watching The Squeakquel, the fun of the first film fades away as you realize that this time around, you could just as easily say that about the script."
1,"Harmless, diverting and forgivably silly fun that will delight kids while keeping adults awake and, for the most part, amused."
0,"Zachary Levi is easily the single worst element of The Squeakquel, which speaks to the depths of annoyance the actor plummets to. The cartoons show more wit and ease with a punchline than this guy."
0,"It's far from the most unpleasant kiddie flick I've sat through this year, although I would be misleading you if I promised you lots of laughs."
0,"a half-assed, low-budget enterprise trading on children's endless appetite for talking animals"
0,Hollywood used to know that a good children's movie is one that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It's not just about keeping the 6-year-olds in their seats.
1,"Kids will love this movie and %u2014 as history teaches %u2014 they love the chipmunks. It's fast-paced, has plenty of music, a really funny fart joke and a happy-ending life lesson."
0,This is perfect entertainment for those who find 'Teletubbies' and 'Dora the Explorer' to be a little too highbrow.
0,There are worse forms of torture.
0,An unsatisfying sequel to a very mediocre first film. It is so unfunny and painful that I actually saw people walking out of the free screening I attended.
0,"Fractious, family-friendly and funky, it's nevertheless cutsey charmless. Expect an inevitable Threequel."
0,"The bottom line is that if you're under the age of 10 or you somehow enjoyed the god-awful 2007 original then you are more likely than not to enjoy this one, too."
0,"Richard Widmark is dead but his spirit improbably lives on in this 'squeakquel,' in which the allegedly adorable harmonizing rodents cause an old lady in a wheelchair to roll down a steep flight of stairs..."
0,The film as a whole is only marginally less entertaining than playing roadkill Frisbee.
0,"Yes, it's probably a good film for children. But when films far more sophisticated and enjoyable like ""Up"" or ""Where the Wild Things Are"" come out, a film like this merely seems trivial."
0,Kids will love it but adults will squirm. A little squeak from the chipmunks goes a long way.
0,... silly but harmless ...
0,"Blending CGI and live action, this ""squeakquel"" to the witless 2007 kids' film proves just how dangerous such technology is when placed in the wrong hands."
1,"Like the Three Stooges, McHale's Navy, and the Brides of Funkenstein, the Chipmunks are a true pop-cultural sleeper sensation."
0,"Alvin must be the most unsympathetic lead in any kiddie franchise, and having him do squeaked-up De Niro impersonations doesn't help."
0,"A truly terrible, utterly witless comedy."
0,"In a crowded cinema, this is every post-pubescent's nightmare."
0,A kids' movie with few laughs for the older viewer.
0,"This desperate sequel - sorry ""squeakquel"" - is such a blatant cash-in that the producers might as well have gone straight round to young viewers' houses and stolen their piggybanks."
0,"They call this the ""squeakquel"" and that's about all you'll want to know about a film that remorselessly pulls all the levers of the first highly successful box-office attraction."
0,"I must be the old stinker. I think that if you're activities cause property damage, you're a vandal. It's not cute to behave irresponsibly if the result is thousands of dollars in repairs. That's just destruction."
0,"Easy resolutions pop up and there's no real drama, with flat jokes, overacting and wasted comic-talent voices slathered between the plot's thin slices-of-strife like cheap peanut butter."
0,Kids may enjoy [it]. But kids also would enjoy an all-candy dinner -- which is why grown-ups have to step in and help them make better entertainment choices.
0,I never thought the day would come where I'd wish I were watching Scooby-Doo rather than what's actually onscreen.
0,"Throwaway fun at some points of the film, but on the whole it's simply very frustrating."
1,
0,Were they always this boring?
0,The cinematic equivalent of unwrapping a fruitcake on Christmas morning.
1,"A marvelously rich visual, intellectual and emotional experience, one that I expect will grow deeper with repeat viewings."
1,"This could have been an emotionally wrenching film, but Desplechin keeps the tone light, infusing the drama with humor in the most unexpected places."
1,There are no martyrs in this anti-sentimental ironic movie that nevertheless percolates with emotion and accepts its quirky characters for all of their flaws.
1,"Blurring the lines between TV soap opera and tight narrative, Desplechin's multi-generational family saga is a bravura piece, based on witty writing, inventive storytelling, and superlative acting of a large ensemble headed by the regal Catherine Deneuve"
1,"By frontloading the dramatic meat of the story, the film becomes less about shocking revelations or plot twists than the sometimes comic, sometimes serious dynamics of a family under extreme strain."
1,A gift that keeps on giving
1,Arnaud Desplechin doesn't so much direct movies as conduct marathons.
1,"A dysfunctional French family learning that `it is never too late to bring love, peace and healing into a divisive and unforgiving household."
1,'A Christmas Tale' finds time for bits that have no reason but strike home as true.
1,"Arnaud Desplechin's A Christmas Tale is an intricate, accomplished patchwork of sometimes nutty but always believable human behaviour."
1,"Each in succession, the curiosities of A Christmas Tale burst from the surface of the film, almost incapable of containing themselves, their passions, their disappointments, their awkward eruptions of alcoholic rage and familial resentment."
1,In working to keep the audience off-center...Desplechin artfully makes the well-worn family weekend plot endearing again. [Blu-ray]
1,"Overlong, but nicely paced with well-developed characters in both the principal plot and subplots"
0,"What's troubling is its lack of perspective on anything beyond the narrow, navel-gazing concerns of its characters."
1,"Dense, energetic, occasionally indulgent but ultimately involving family drama, about the travails of a dysfunctional extended middle-class family who convene to celebrate Christmas, delivers gifts by way of a sterling cast led by Catherine Deneuve and Ma"
1,A Christmas Tale is a bad dream with just enough distance to give us a midwinter's night's laugh.
1,"A Christmas Tale brilliantly captures the melancholy and familial recrimination that, for some people, is as much a part of the holiday season as fruitcake and egg nog."
1,"A Christmas Tale (Un Conte de Noel) is a darkly comic dysfunctional family fairy tale, more Meet Me In Saint Louis than The Royal Tenenbaums, with a healthy dose of A Midsummer Night's Dream thrown in."
0,"A Christmas Tale isn't repugnant, just regressive. The modern family film has moved beyond this Gallic update of I Remember Mama."
1,"Out of the most ordinary ingredients -- an ailing mother, estranged adult siblings, a good meal ruined by bad behavior -- the endlessly inventive French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin has made the old look fresh in A Christmas Tale."
1,"Deft, playful, fluid, haunting, and filled with the joy of filmmaking."
1,A Christmas Tale is a film experience to be seen and savored for its exquisite delineation of human feelings and foibles.
1,"Dark secrets are unlocked, words draw more blood than punches, and [director] Desplechin turns one family into a universe that resembles life as a startling work of art."
1,a work of intoxicating genius.
1,"It's the definition of a film meant to be admired more than loved, but Desplechin's fierce intelligence and uncompromising sense of character come through."
1,...like a stocking stuffed by the most inventive and mischievous of gift givers.
1,Enduringly fascinating and involving.
1,"Has as much emotional baggage as any soap opera but not an ounce of melodrama, exploring the cuts and letting us understand the scars."
1,"Followed by Desplechin창(TM)s restless camera, they roam the house, which is at once a lived-in haven and a mausoleum filled with the relics of past battles and shifting alliances."
1,"How do you say, 'Don't even go there, girlfriend!' in French?"
1,"The picture is so alive with familial love and intrigue, with the richness of human complexity, that you want to reach out and hug it."
1,"A long, improbably funny and very beautiful film."
1,Some wry humor runs through the course of the overly long saga. But there's not enough dark wit to mitigate the tedium and pretentiousness.
1,"After two and a half hours in the thrilling, exhausting company of the characters in A Christmas Tale, the intimacy we feel with them is wired with surprise."
1,"If Ingmar Bergman and Wes Anderson some how collaborated on a movie together, I'd guess their sensibilities would yield something like Arnaud Desplechin's darkly hilarious, brilliantly acted A Christmas Tale."
1,"Wry, observant and frequently heartbreaking."
1,"These infuriating, involving individuals are so resolutely themselves, so sure they are right by their own lights, they exist in a world beyond anyone's judgment."
1,"Those looking for a cheery family gathering for the holidays flick might want to look elsewhere. Those who enjoy quirky family dramas, beautifully written, performed and shot will be thrilled by Desplechin's latest."
1,"The characters' explosive emotions - tender and bitter, guilt-wracked and willfully inscrutable - make ""A Christmas Tale"" an edge-of-your-seat experience in a way most thrillers could only dream about."
1,...plays at times like The Royal Tenenbaums without the twee affectations but nearly all the humor.
1,[A] gloriously shaggy dog of a family soap opera.
1,"A sprawling, complex web of family betrayals, emotionally stunted relationships, disappointments, banishments and plain old eccentric behavior are clich챕 by now, but in this movie it's all so frighteningly true."
1,"Getting through these first 20 minutes is as necessary as plowing through the first 50 pages of a 19th century novel. Once that work is over, the movie's singular pleasures reveal themselves."
1,"If Four Christmases is merely a stocking stuffer, this is the new car out in the driveway with the big red ribbon around it."
1,The family's vulnerabilities and eccentricities burrow under the skin.
1,A classic French family drama featuring fine performances by legend Catherine Deneuve and reigning star Mathieu Amalric even if the raging and crying might be a bit much for the Christmas season.
1,"Once the connections become clear, however, this often bitter story almost becomes a thriller, as we fear the next outburst or revelation and its aftermath."
1,"Watching A Christmas Tale is like getting to know a family other than your own by leafing through its scrapbooks and laughing at its photograph albums, while it bickers in the next room over stuff you may never understand."
0,"I'd be more inclined to call this French dysfunctional family epic gabby and preeningly self-indulgent -- in a word, annoying."
1,"A Christmas Tale is long but it exerts enough of a pull that the 150 minutes pass rapidly, if not necessarily painlessly."
1,"Depslachin's film is not brimming over with good cheer, hardly, but it is warm and sometimes funny and refreshingly honest, illustrating the complicated beast that often is family."
1,"Roiling with laughter, tears, drunken confessions, revelatory soliloquies, pain, sorrow, hospital visits, and various kinds of love, A Christmas Tale is a smart, sprawling, and sublimely entertaining feast."
1,"It's a simple picture about complicated people, the members and sometime-combatants of the extended Vuillard family."
0,"Characters occasionally address the camera, which helps disentangle the competing story lines of madness, adultery, and betrayal."
1,There are simply too many marvels to tally.
1,"The most emotionally rich and cinematically thrilling film I've seen all year, a film that pulses with human life in all its terrible and beautiful irrationality."
1,"To tweak Tolstoy: All happy families may be alike, but all unhappy-family movies are entertaining in their own ways."
1,"Even though it's pretentious and overlong, A Christmas Tale is still maddeningly engaging, thanks in large part to its attractive and gifted cast."
1,"A Christmas Tale is beautifully acted by all. The bigger dramatic moments in the film are believable, but the occasional fights and arguments cannot hold a candle to the quieter moments of truth permeating out of the scenes."
1,A good film with great performances that's only held back a bit by its extreme length and the pacing and pretentiousness that goes with it.
1,A strangely encompassing collection of private moments among the members of a large family with a fraught history.
1,"Call me nuts, but even with all the dysfunction and suffering, I found lots to cherish about this artistically personal holiday film."
1,A picture of unpleasant people treating each other poorly that comes across as buoyant and frankly joyful at times.
1,'A Christmas Tale' has revived my love for goofy families as only the French can do.
0,"It leaves no lasting impression, except for one excruciating scene involving a bone marrow transplant."
1,"Through a thicket of subplots..., Desplechin slowly and gracefully unfolds the damage done by years of bad blood."
1,Filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin (Kings and Queens) and his co-screenwriter Emmanuel Mourdieu have created something that is rich with characters and themes.
1,"Yet as the film progresses these multifarious layers of dramatic ennui and vitriol becomes absolutely intoxicating, and before I knew it my eyes were glued to the screen and I almost couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next."
0,"Yet another dysfunctional-family, holiday-reunion film that's no better, no worse than its bourgeois predecessors - unless you happen to be a Francophile."
0,...ultimately suffers from a middling midsection that's been suffused with pointless digressions and melodramatic crises...
1,"A Christmas Tale's expansive stew of physical and psychological illness, death, betrayal, longing, religion, and ritual ultimately proves invigoratingly lush."
1,[It] will make anyone dreading the holidays with their family grateful for what strife they may face. It's nothing compared to what the Vuillard clan gets up to.
1,A minor masterpiece.
1,"A triumph of willed optimism (or perhaps more accurately, of grudging good nature) over unhappy experiences..."
1,"Never devolves into a tedious two-and-a-half hours of self-examination. But it also never goes very far, either."
1,Seems hardly like cheerful holiday fare but nevertheless goes down as richly as plum pudding.
1,"At last, a great contemporary holiday movie that's strictly for grown-ups -- a holiday movie that really is a moviegoer's holiday from desultory daily fare."
1,A CHRISTMAS TALE is your typical Holiday drama that's elevated by stylish direction and an infectious energy
0,"As charming as the film's title sounds, here is a movie, distinctly French in its clipped rhythms and melodramatic arc, that's anything but charming. It is, in fact, a jumbled, caustic tour-de-force."
1,A Christmas Tale is the yuletide antidote to Four Christmases.
1,"There's a giddiness to this whirling dervish of a film, with its spastic skipping from character and catharsis, its near fetishistic camera trickery, bursts of song, and loving lifts from the likes of Vertigo and Nietzsche."
1,"For people who find that movies that are full of sentimentality and sympathy set off their gag reflex, this is the holiday movie for you."
1,A Christmas Tale seems less like a movie than a genuine family being observed.
1,"If you want to see a Christmas story that's genuinely heartwarming and entertaining without ever slipping into phony sentimentality, you'd better learn to read subtitles."
1,
1,A warmly inviting motion picture.
1,Consider it a post-holiday gift to yourself.
1,"Arnaud Desplechin's sprawling family drama is sharply observed and superbly acted, but it's also far too long and fails to engage on an emotional level."
1,A compellingly literate exploration of the muddle of misguided motives and lingering regrets that bind families together.
0,"You could, of course, forgive the whole enterprise as the extravagances of an intellectual fairytale, but the film's wayward eccentricities outweigh its good performances and breezy telling of a jumble of a plot."
1,What could have been the acme of talky dramas about the inner lives of French intellectuals turns out to be a feast of a movie.
1,The film is almost as involving as it is infuriating.
1,"The effect is strange, disconcerting - but never dull. I think what Desplechin has created is not a conventional drama, but a sort of dream-ensemble masque: a choreographed parade of ideas, emotions, personae. A film to ponder, and to savour."
0,"The cast expertly incarnates this family haunted by loss, lovelessness and (literal) bad blood, but the film's unduly protracted duration makes the Vuillards feel like Christmas guests who just will not leave."
0,"At a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours, the film does at least have one thing in common with other Christmas visitors - it long outstays its welcome."
0,"Typically Gallic, it contains lots of smoking, drinking and thinking. With the thoughts often turning towards death."
1,"A Christmas Tale is a compelling domestic drama, a French art gem to inaugurate 2009."
1,"Bustling and chaotic like most big families, this film really captures the outrageous collision of personalities in any gathering of relatives"
0,an endlessly busy and stylish film with a hollow emotional and spiritual core.
1,The characters are so nutty that you never know what they will do next. That fact alone kept me interested.
1,"Arnaud Desplechin's headfirst dive into the complex relationships within a middle class French family is a messy, captivating, and very much living affair."
1,"A droll and frantic melodrama stripped of aesthetic contrivances but full of emotional ones, and it is affirming in its own way without being particularly cathartic."
1,Controlled chaos of a family reunion highlighed by likeable but flawed characters
0,Un conte de No챘l could use more of the surreal hilarity of Wes Anderson'sThe Royal Tenenbaums.
1,"Un drama coral y familiar sobre relaciones disfuncionales, viejos rencores, odios y amores, enfermedad y muerte. Puede resultar tan desconcertante e irritante como sorprendente y humana. Lo innegable es la calidad de su elenco."
0,Till life do us part
1,The film (has) a sensibility that is paradoxically both old-fashioned and very modern.
1,"There isn't a convincing note in the entire film, but there's no denying that each bit of dramatic fakery glitters and hums. A bit like Christmas itself, actually, which might just be the point."
1,"Not very cheerful holiday fare? Turns out to be more upbeat than you'd think, without any angels or friendly ghosts, thanks to Desplechin's affectionate approach to his characters."
0,Even Amalric's ray of light can't penetrate the gloom enough to make this much more than a rather strained actors' exercise.
1,"The movie teems with the excitement of unwrapping a present, even as it deals more seriously with the intractability of blood ties."
1,"As the rituals of Christmas are observed, the family edges closer towards a sense of understanding and acceptance in a picture that captures a sense of life's messy uncertainties and the way we sometimes hurt the ones we love the most."
1,It's maddening and it's exhilarating.
1,"A Christmas Tale's more universal qualities should be apparent to anyone who has survived a Christmas, and God help us, here comes another one."
0,Its numerous narrative strands are neither revealingly pursued nor properly intertwined.
1,"A Christmas Tale has a classical feel, even though the mischievous Desplechin tosses in shadow puppets, iris shots, and actors speaking directly to the camera. It's this ability to surprise that gives the film its spark."
1,"Desplechin's film is so well cast and the relationships so authentically depicted that it's okay not to be completely or partially taken by Junon, Henri, and the rest of their kin."
1,"A Christmas Tale is a lively, capricious, mischievous ensemble delight."
1,"Despite occasional bouts of tedium over the epic course, a surprising buoyancy emerges: Desplechin's methods begin to inform, even brighten, the message."
1,"Desplechin is an inspired impurist. His Christmas Tale is untidy, overstuffed and delicious: a genuine holiday feast."
1,"Given his cornucopia of characters fighting wars on three fronts, his whiplash tonal switchbacks, his jazzlike aesthetic of chance, how is it that Arnaud Desplechin is only now coming home for the holidays?"
1,"[Desplechin] has skill, patience, empathy, and insight; quickened by the holiday occasion, they make the title of his film ultimately, if unconventionally, right."
1,"It takes about half an hour of screen time, until everyone gets packed into the house, for A Christmas Tale to reveal its nature fully: expansive in narrative scheme, compact in emotional space and self-consciously auteurist to the core."
1,"It's a bracingly eccentric, waspishly intelligent blast of flashbacks, freeze frames, split screens, and bizarre music choices."
1,"Not since, well, Kings & Queen has calling something overstuffed been such a compliment."
1,Perfect off-season timing for a wickedly off-kilter movie about a French family Christmas in extremis.
1,"A Christmas Tale has bountiful charm in the first leg of the film, mainly because it is able to take a lovely, dry wit to its characters' bitterness."
0,"Un Comte de Noel is a long, rambling story of a bourgeois family going into dysfunctional overdrive during a reunion at the parental home."
1,If you are intrigued by the interpersonal relationships and entanglements of a family - maybe a lot like yours and mine - this film is a fascinating expos챕 that might well prompt some seasonal self-reflection.
1,"Arnaud Desplechin's mercurial, knotty and cinematically vibrant drama of family dysfunction stirred up over a Christmas gathering was my pick for best film of 2008"
0,"Catherine Deneuve, for her part, is luminous as always. But the entire film feels cold and distant, and fatally unfocused."
1,"Though A Christmas Tale clocks in at 152 minutes, it never feels tired or fails to compel."
0,"It's laboured and clunky, or crude and vulgar, when it should be funny and zippy"
1,"This glossy Hollywood piece is not for everyone as it joins the dots and goes for the obvious, but it's good natured enough"
0,An utterly predictable entrant in the Cougedy genre sees a yummy-mummy (Zeta-Jones) and her 25 year-old babysitter (Bartha) tumble into love after she takes her two young children to a new life in New York.
1,"A charming and observant tone helps lift this above most romantic comedies, at least until the formula kicks in during the final rather contrived act. But until then, it keeps us happily smiling and sighing along."
0,"Laughs are in short supply, and Mr Freundlich resorts to gross-out lavatory humour that's an unnecessary concession to youthful audiences who wouldn't like this movie anyway."
1,"These are characters who seem very real. It's their imperfections, not contrived plot points, that drive the story."
0,Why is a movie that's trying to evoke some of the cool metropolitanism of late-'70s Woody Allen so rammed with hoary gags about New York being awash with transvestites and homeless flashers?
1,"Thanks to a mischievous humour and charming leads, it's surprisingly enjoyable. More Zeta-Jones rom-coms, please."
0,"There is much about The Rebound that does not work, but you can't help giving it some credit for attempting to roam slightly outside the scope of most rom-coms, even if it can't entirely pull it off."
0,"The romantic trials of two wealthy, good-looking people, whose only barriers to happiness are their own petty insecurities, become tedious, and it's not helped by some stilted dialogue and awkward, mannered performances."
1,There are a few funny lines - especially when she goes on a cringey date with a slimy chiropractor - but there are also too many unlikely scenarios and clunky dialogue.
1,"The positives of The Rebound vastly outweigh the minor criticisms. It's also not afraid to adopt a sudden tonal shift at a key juncture of the plot, which works fairly well."
0,"ven slap-bang in the middle of the worst year for romcoms in living memory, The Rebound deserves a special boot up the backside for its raging incompetence."
1,"It's not side-splittingly funny, or exactly emotionally trenchant, but Zeta-Jones and Bartha are both decidedly charming, even if there's a notable lack of sexual chemistry between them."
0,"Zeta-Jones is always fun when she's bad, but she still hasn't found the right leading man to bring out her cuddly side."
1,"Watchable romantic comedy, enlivened by good dialogue, strong performances and likeable characters, though it occasionally struggles to find the right tone and is let down by a hideously contrived ending."
1,"The Rebound offers up surprisingly nice characters (too nice, you could argue) and a modest charm that compensates for a lack of big laughs or much suspense."
0,Another faintly insulting rom-com promoting a marketing man's idea of what women really want from movies...
1,"The Rebound is largely character-driven, which is more than a lot of romantic films can vouch for."
0,"Saddling two game actors with a tone-deaf, charmless script, the film makes recent J.Lo vehicle The Back-up Plan look like Billy Wilder in comparison."
0,An unromantic comedy that gets down and dirty.
0,"Although it bears the marks of studio intervention, much of the blame remains firmly with Freundlich, who's incapable of arranging a single honest moment in this uncomfortable, frightfully strained creation."
0,Poor writing and inconsistencies sink this film. Let's hope that Zeta-Jones and Bartha can rebound.
0,...a thoroughly (and consistently) misguided piece of work that has almost nothing truthful or relevant to say about relationships.
1,"The Rebound does nothing new but does it, for the most part, well. Zeta-Jones and Bartha have sweet chemistry together and it's refreshing to see her portray uncertainty with elements of frumpiness and doggedness."
0,"This recipe can serve an entire Odeon at one sitting and, astonishingly and depressingly, will probably even make money at the box office, even though the best accompaniments are boredom and ennui."
0,"The Rebound is a little deeper than your average rom-com, but only a little."
0,"Nothing more than an elongated soap opera, sans the self-awareness."
0,"I understand Amer is supposed to be going through some sort of spiritual crisis here, but Caland plays him as so self-centered and precious that it's impossible to feel any sympathy for him."
0,"Thank God Whitaker is here to bring a bit of real pathos and ambiguity to his role as the spiritual guide who's gained wisdom through adversity, because without his Oscar-winning chops, this exercise in pop mysticism would have been too painful to bear."
1,"After a bumpy start, Ripple Effect begins to show why Whitaker, Virginia Madsen and Minnie Driver signed on as executive producers and co-stars."
0,Several ordinarily banal movies soldered into one amazingly bad one.
0,Starts with a not-very-original insight and takes too many shortcuts delivering it.
1,"Kudos to writer/director/co-star Philippe Caland for crafting such a refreshingly unpredictable cautionary tale and for coaxing inspired performances from an A-list cast which inludes by Forest Whitaker, Virginia Madsen and Minnie Driver."
0,"Ultimately it feels like Poppe wanted to say something about a great many topics...But what he concludes on any one of these points is never clear, so the film simply meanders..."
1,"A compelling, if well worn , topic - work/life balance - is brought vividly to life by a great Binoche performance."
1,"The film survives mostly off the wonderful, absorbing leading performance by Binoche, in what a truly layered character to get your head around."
1,"It's as handsomely shot as any film about an ace shutterbug ought to be, and Juliette Binoche infuses familiar internal crises with palpable pain and urgency."
0,I found something questionable in its forced and unearned emotional moments and the frankly rather insufferable performance from Juliette Binoche in the lead role.
0,A trick missed.
0,"Every theme and thesis is italicised. We aren't trusted to probe them with our own minds. The preaching is accompanied, for extra emphasis, by treacly sacerdotal music."
1,"The film has limitations. But it has Binoche, and that's almost enough."
1,"This is a well-observed drama, which acknowledges the war photographer's selfishness as well as her courage and single-mindedness."
1,"A drama of conscience and passion, a finely observed portrait of a woman driven to make a difference in the world, even as it hurts those she loves."
1,When an actor is as good as Juliette Binoche they can elevate an entire film.
1,"Cleverly, the film makes it clear that Binoche is also strongly motivated by bringing suffering and injustice to light, making the central conflict that bit sharper."
1,"Binoche is marvellous throughout, and gets strong support - even if kitten-loving Lisa, in straining to be cute, is merely irritating."
1,"Too prickly for mainstream crowds and rather emotionally sentimental for arthouse fans, this drama may have trouble finding an audience."
0,"A hyperbolic melodrama which oversimplifies its issues, and features too many scenes of Binoche weeping against picturesque Irish landscapes."
1,"Although the ideas and performances are strong, the drama itself feels oddly disjointed ..."
0,"Much of the domestic emotion feels contrived. Not the acting, that's mostly very good, it's the mechanisms constructed to portray emotion that falters."
1,"An affecting drama made more poignant by honest-feeling autobiographical elements, Erik Poppe's A Thousand Times Goodnight examines the choice between family and career when that career represents work of real social importance."
1,"Deftly sidestepping both melodrama and family-values messaging, Poppe imbues the film with enormous emotional resonance, brilliantly grounded by his leading lady."
0,"Poppe's closeness to the material ensures a level of passion, but he still fails to create a truly specific dynamic for Rebecca and Marcus's family ..."
0,It's difficult to swallow the premise of yet another tale of a heroic white Westerner with good intentions trying to give hope to Middle-Eastern misery.
1,"When Poppe is filming the things he cares about-war, domestic battles, or even the planes of Juliette Binoche's face-1,000 Times Good Night is exquisite."
0,A self-important art-house film by an ex- war photographer who lacks distance from his subject.
1,"Director Erik Poppe's film features cinematography that is artsy without being alienating, but the same cannot be said for his protagonist."
1,Poppe crafts some powerful scenes that pose questions not easily answered.
1,"What makes ""1,000 Times Good Night"" more than a dramatic essay on wartime journalism is Ms. Binoche's wrenchingly honest portrayal ..."
1,"1,000 Times Good Night moves too easily from compelling to contrived, but ultimately works due to a commanding performance from Juliette Binoche."
1,"""1,000 Times Good Night"" has moments of both startling violence and breathtaking beauty."
0,"Sadly, this gorgeous-looking adult movie plays out the same theme over and over, never going anywhere surprising."
1,"""1,000 Times Good Night"" takes its time, letting the pathos fully soak in. Those who are regulars at film festivals will find the pacing - and the emotional note it ends on - very familiar."
0,"A disappointingly standard-issue addiction melodrama, this one the tearful case study of an adrenaline junkie whose compulsion threatens to push her family and loved ones away."
0,"Poppe's intimate story feels contrived. Autobiographical films have a tendency to come off that way, likely because the director lacks distance and takes plot and character development for granted."
1,Poppe can't match the stunning opener of Binoche photographing a suicide bomber in Kabul with scenes of domesticity. But Binoche never falters. She's the film's fire and grieving heart.
1,Binoche and most of the cast keep the drama worthy of our attention.
1,A sensitive drama about the challenges idealists and people of great passion face within the family circle.
1,"Binoche is her usual dependable self, bringing passion and fury to a familiar, but still compelling, character. And director Karl Poppe, himself a former photojournalist and cinematographer, captures the various locales with visual panache."
1,"Despite a screenplay that lets her down for the most part, Binoche is wonderful as Rebecca, a woman divided by her passion for the job and maternal instincts."
1,"The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful."
1,Moving story about mother/war photograher has mature themes.
1,"As one would expect with of a film made by a photographer, 1,000 Times Good Night is always visually interesting."
1,"This potent Norwegian drama by Erik Poppe, himself a veteran war photographer, opens with a gripping sequence."
1,"In a heart-wrenching performance, Juliette Binoche haunts as a war-photographer whose camera acts as her moral compass but blinds her to her family's needs"
1,"It's a rich, fascinating and provocative film that never takes sides or opts for easy answers."
1,"Poppe registers Rebecca's moral commitment as well as the compulsive aspect of her dedication but the film oscillates between drama and statement; it becomes a series of set-pieces and what-ifs, particularly towards the end."
1,I wanted it to be more than it was.
1,When we see photos or film footage taken at great risk on the front line we rarely stop to think of the price paid by the photographer; this film rectifies that.
1,"Anger and anguish visible in her eyes and etched in the lines of her face, Juliette Binoche delivers a terrific performance."
0,"Binoche is impressive, bringing a steely, self-contained detachment to even the most intimate moments with her family. But Erik Poppe, the director, slathers the film in overly sentimental music choices"
0,"Alas, following on from such a striking and tense opening was always going to be difficult. The focus swiftly shifts to an account of disturbed domesticity, and so does the A Thousand Times Good Night's effectiveness and interest."
1,"If I'm complaining about this movie a lot for one I'm deeming better than fair, it's because I was frustrated by how its first-rate ingredients, Binoche chief among them, somehow failed to create a spectacular end result."
1,"Shot with a gorgeous eye, the filmmakers aren't afraid of lens flare or overexposure to add an ethereal beauty to horrific circumstances of which we're bracing for impact."
0,The geopolitical realities of 2015 entitle us to expect something more nuanced than this.
0,"Despite Binoche's mighty efforts, 1,000 Times Good Night never recovers from its self-congratulatory ambitions and mechanical plotting. It's the movie that winds up shell-shocked."
1,"... although at times the story seemed unsurprising, the end really packs a punch. There are lots of layers to unfold here, both personal and political."
1,"As for Binoche, her performance as Rebecca is a standout even in a year that included winning turns in films from Fred Schepisi and Olivier Assayas."
1,"The low-budget high-school comedy is no 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' but should provide for not only laughs but some insight into the life of a smart, 13-year-old outsider."
1,"Abigail's older brother Spencer Breslin, does his own magnificent Little Mister Sunshine leading boy thing. Harold, a kinder, gentler Superbad - the talking dirty teen motormouths. Move over, Judd Apatow."
0,The presence of Cuba Gooding Jr. in this odd little indie comedy should set off early alarm bells.
0,An outsider adolescent sinks in a sea of troubles in this wobbly comedy.
0,"The long stretches of dead air that, it can only be assumed, were supposed to be filled by laughter provide ample time for pondering what audience Harold, T. Sean Shannon's strenuously stale comedy, was intended to find."
0,Harold is a genuine oddity that's more watchable than it sounds.
0,"Shot and lit like a mediocre TV show, the sporadically amusing Harold is a true Blockbuster contender, that is for the bargain bins of the video store. And soon."
0,"There's little indication, beyond the endlessly unfunny school humiliations and fogey-dom signposts (ha ha, he uses Old Spice), that the notion of a preteen codger is worth our sympathies."
1,Breslin is the best thing about this myopic comedy that doesn't even get any humorous traction from the stereotypes it presses through its low-fidelity independent film filter.
0,"Harold is the type of one-note dead zone ideally suited for a bathroom break while sitting home on a Saturday night, alone and semidrunk, in front of the television."
0,
0,"Has a wan sweetness to it which helps it through its more forced and obvious patches, of which there are many."
0,A terminally lame puberty comedy about a prematurely bald 13-year-old.
1,"While the script never gels into anything worthy of the peculiar premise, Harold is still worth seeing for Breslin's marvelously weird performance."
0,"confidently struts along, seemingly unaware of its lackluster script and distinct lack of professionalism."
1,
0,"Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter David Boula are content to rely on the usual suspects, taking their visual and dramatic cues from other, more clever and involving sci-fi capers."
0,Engagingly photographed but dramatically inert.
0,A confused jumble of parts in search of a whole.
1,"A harrowing mindbender which successfully blends elements of X-Men, The Matrix and Memento while adding some of its own unique sci-fi flava."
0,It's an ambitious attempt to shove the whole of a fairly complex comic book universe into a single messy and garish movie.
0,"A weightless, style-driven thriller set in a photogenically chaotic Hong Kong."
1,The film is blessed with a frenetic pace that simultaneously accomplishes two things: it keeps the energy level high while obfuscating some of the most obvious logical flaws in the plot's structure.
0,A clutter of worn genre elements stitched together with superficial stylistics.
1,"Push is supremely elegant, even beautiful; you can get lost in the visuals even as the narrative implodes. If ever there were a triumph of style over substance, this is it."
0,"The scenes focused on lukewarm dialogue outnumber the action scenes ten to one, giving the film a listless, low-energy vibe."
0,"Even with all its idiosyncratic elements, Push feels like something we've seen before. Unfortunately, said memory is of something far more fascinating and definitely more engaging."
0,"Push falters not in trying to add its voice to the genre, it falters in not having anything compelling to say."
0,Movies don't get more headache-inducing than Push.
0,"The ending left me scratching my head, unsure of what had happened, but certain of one thing: The giant pile of loose ends means somebody intends to make a sequel."
1,"A trippy, nonstop action fest, with the feel of a really good episode of Heroes."
0,"Eventually buckling beneath the girth of its own mythology, Push ends with less a cliffhanger than really just a cliff."
1,It's the perfect brain vacation for those overtaxed by Oscar-nominated movies.
1,"An ambling, broody concoction along the lines of Strange Days."
0,Not much of it makes sense. The rest isn't terribly interesting.
0,... delivers the requisite spectacle... but skimps on character and story.
1,"Push is NBC's Heroes, if anything ever happened on Heroes besides oh so mysterious prophecies and a litany of excuses to avoid action sequences."
0,A great premise is marred by disastrous execution in this disappointingly un-heroic take on the comic-book genre.
1,...a fun thriller that has a couple of tricks up it's sleeve.
0,Imagine if the X-Men had spent most of their time sitting around talking about how they were going to fight Magneto instead of ever actually doing anything and you'll have a good sense of what is wrong with Push.
0,"An unholy mixture of Heroes and Jumper...'What if nothing we did made any sense?' says the inept hero, apparently reciting the credo of the moviemakers."
0,"Push barely measures up to even the worst moments on ""Heroes,"" and it makes 20th Century Fox's weaker superhero efforts look much better."
0,...your understanding of just what is happening will correspond to the amount of time you spend watching the Sci-Fi channel and TV shows such as Heroes.
0,It would take some pretty powerful mind control to convince audiences that Push is a winner.
0,"I thought Hayden Christensen in last year's Jumper would be as bland a mutant as the screen would ever give us, but that was before I saw Chris Evans in Push."
0,"In plot, it meanders. In character development, it implodes. In action, it plods. In effect, it numbs, but, alas, not quickly enough."
0,"Push has amazing special effects and production design, but that doesn't compensate for the messy, incoherent plot and lack of truly palpable Sci-fi thrills and excitement."
0,"Belle... is blank as a page, and the intended romantic chemistry between her and Evans is never in evidence."
0,"Push has vibrant cinematography and decent acting, but I'm blasted if I know what it's about."
0,"Push has an interesting premise, but it just doesn't manage to translate it into a great movie."
1,A better-than-average sci-fi thriller with genuine jolts and unexpected texture.
1,One of the better recent attempts at cashing in on the superhero film craze without having an actual comic book to adapt.
1,Pure escapist fun.
1,The best thing about the movie is that you can never predict exactly where it's going.
1,Sci-fi thriller has more style than story; some iffy stuff.
0,"There are many problems with Push, and most are the usual boring things: unnecessary plot loops; long, dumb musical interludes; a charmless script; and ostentatious action sequences in which the only person excited is the cameraman."
0,"When Push comes to shove, don't expect to care about any of it."
0,A silly movie that is partially engrossing and plenty convoluted.
0,"Evans and 10,000 BC's Belle shuffle through a turgid romantic subplot, and though the two characters are very, very pretty, they've got the chemical spark of a banana."
0,A grubby cut-price sci-fi thriller.
0,"Just as it's getting impossible to tell the superpowered humans without a scorecard, along comes Push to muddy the waters."
0,"By the time the credits roll, your most fervent wish is to run into a 'wiper' (one who can erase memories)."
0,A bargain basement melding of clich챕s from the X-Men franchise and TV's Heroes.
0,You know a sci-fi script is in trouble when it spends the first five minutes narratively briefing you on its Byzantine plot -- and you're still not sure what's going on.
0,"Suggestive of X-Men, The Matrix and the television show Heroes, Push is one of those time-mangling thrillers that manages to seem both complicated and superficial."
0,"One long mistake from start to finish, this is a film that never gets its rhythms or bearing right."
0,It's like watching an X-Men movie that doesn't feature the leather costumes and which doesn't have enough in the way of requisite thrills or action to keep anyone interested in it for very long.
0,"It goes nowhere new and offers nothing we haven't seen before, and while it's nice the filmmakers put so much stock in building their characters three-dimensionally the fact they give them all nothing of interest or merit to do kind of defeats the purpose"
1,It does the job it sets out to do: providing engaging entertainment centered around an interesting idea that it respects enough to think through properly.
0,Parental Content Review
0,"Too much explanation, of the sort Cassie is inclined to provide, only slows down the nonsense Push is pushing."
1,"With mediocre expectations going in, the flick's cleverness, great score and wicked fight scenes lead me to recommend this to anyone looking for a good time."
0,"As a whole, Push feels unfinished, its ultimate destination accounting for nothing more than a shrug. There is a fair amount to like here, and just as much to resent for how much better it could have been."
0,"You have to be clairvoyant to follow the particulars of this overly complicated, unconvincing thriller about folks with paranormal abilities."
0,[D]isappointingly generic shoot-'em-up dressed up with a few paranormal frills...
0,"As far as I can tell, the only ability in short supply is acting."
1,What really struck me more than the plot itself was McGuigan's amazing use of location and space; it feels as if this movie and these characters are really living in Hong Kong.
1,"It's not great, but it's a perfectly fine version of psychics on the run versus the bad guys."
1,"Absolutely derivative, but nonetheless of interest."
0,"'Push' suffers from a baffling script, but Dakota Fanning delivers a very watchable performance in this sci-fi thriller."
0,Push is this year's Jumper. 'Nuff said.
0,"Long on style, short on substance and logic, it's baffling and frenetic, defeated by its own chaotic cleverness."
0,It's the kind of film you wish had no sound - perhaps the studio should have eliminated the dialogue and replaced it cue cards every few minutes like the silent films of old.
0,"Except for the cast, 'Push' reminds me a little bit of last year's 'Jumper.'"
0,"This is the kind of film where nothing makes sense, it's one huge plot hole. And if that wasn't negative enough, it's witless, boring, shallow and too talky."
0,"If you want to see a movie about mutants with superpowers, watch any of the X-Men movies or the ""Hellboy"" movies or ""Wanted,"" any of those six movies is far superior to this."
0,"This would be sci-fi action-thriller feels like a failed television pilot... or better yet, a demo version for something that could be much better with a lot more production value and polish."
0,"Movers, pushers, shadowers - whatever! The script was insane and the characters were inane."
0,"Oh, to have my brain wiped of Push. The smell of desperation on the part of filmmakers to create their own superhero franchise is rancid."
0,"Great ideas, rotten execution."
0,... a rather bland and hard-to-follow knock off of the trendy Heroes/X-Men template.
0,"A kick-ass soundtrack, sexy imagery, and the ghost of a narrative to string it all together."
0,"Silliness rules the day: plot holes abound and are plugged with techno-pounding action sequences and more nonsensical guff. As a TV pilot, this might have worked; as a film, it's loud, confusing and inane."
1,"Though ostensibly action sci-fi, McGuigan's film pushes the boundaries of genre, playing out its paranormal parameters like a game of multi-dimensional chess."
0,"""What if nothing we did made any sense. Would that throw them off the scent?"" Nick asks. You bet."
0,At no point do you care if these dough-eyed buffoons live or die.
0,"The lack of any convincing over-arching plot, the muddled use of alternating futures and squashed-together gaggle of wafer-thin characters renders the project a near complete failure when it comes to thrills and entertainment."
0,"British director McGuigan clearly hoped to make more than a dopey, effects-laden actioner. Unfortunately, he's made an uneven and pretentious one instead."
0,"If the words ""A bit like Jumper but not as good"" strike fear into your heart then you might want to avoid this turgid superpower stinker."
1,"Sloppily conceived but directed with flair, Push is bound to split the vote. Look closely and its disparate pieces fit clumsily together; step back and the overall effect has an undeniable allure."
1,Stylishly silly but oddly cool all the same.
0,"Going to see this film doesn't make much sense. It's obviously been cynically conceived as a franchise starter, but abruptly flicking to the end credits seemingly mid-movie is not a good way to start one."
0,"This obviously Heroes-inspired cash-in promises much but delivers very little, thanks to a confusing plot, uninspired direction, poor dialogue and a curiously lacklustre performance from the normally reliable Evans."
0,"A movie so bland, it might as well have been filmed in Hounslow."
0,"Director Paul McGuigan does his best, but this is just a slog that mistakes earnest detail for engaging narrative. Shove."
0,Why would a psychic 'tec need to sniff a toothbrush to locate its user? Does spearmint freshness have a spooky vibe?
1,"Kinetic and convincing, this uses a limited budget to thrilling effect, giving us a sort of X-Men-meets-Trainspotting twist. We hope a sequel follows this early promise."
0,"In time this would-be thriller comes to rest with a fist fight, a hanging ending and the implicit promise of a sequel. Of all the calamities that Fanning predicts, Push 2 is one she missed."
0,It's fun teen stuff but wrecked by director Paul McGuigan's confusing use of constant flashbacks.
0,Sci-fi hokum to give you a headache.
0,No amount of local colour and effects-heavy fisticuffs can save Paul McGuigan's film.
1,"What it lacks in out and out originality it makes up for with some pulsating action, vibrant cinematography and good performances from a decent cast."
0,"an overheated stewpot of divisions, sects and subsects of extra-special, special and quasi-special mentalists, all running around like their pants are on fire ... maybe in search of a viable plot?"
0,Falls into the clumsy trap of being the presumptive first installment of a franchise.
0,Makes viewers feel as if they're watching a movie from inside a spinning clothes dryer.
0,"The violence is incessant, the portentousness constant, the opacity rarely penetrated."
0,"Totally watchable, totally forgettable."
0,Director Paul McGuigan serves this up with a flashy swagger but there is no disguising the fact that it is an incomprehensible mess.
0,"A dull trudge, the sort of popcorn movie that gets released in February rather than during the summer holidays."
0,"Between the unwieldy load of back story and the painfully underdeveloped characters, this infelicitous combination of Jumper, X-Men and TV's Heroes manages to be dull and exhausting at the same time."
0,...suffers from an uneven sensibility that essentially holds the viewer at arm's length virtually from start to finish.
0,A sci-fi thriller with a lot of science fiction and zero thrills.
0,Dashes from genre to genre in search of a reason to exist.
1,A movie I enjoyed watching with a huge smile on my face and will assuredly endure scorn for liking...
0,"The film is likable, but not lovable. All of the pushing can't compete with other sci-fi thrillers. Still, it's worth the ride if you keep an open mind for the unrealistic."
0,A pleasant time-waster with non-abysmal performances and a few interesting concepts.
1,This entry in the superhero sweepstakes isn't without charm
1,"I was at first intrigued, and then bemused and confused."
1,"Pushing ideas into other people's minds is what this sci-fi fantasy thriller is all about, and Paul McGuigan's film looks great. The cast is good too. But there's a problem. The story doesn't make sense"
0,The most amazing thing about this by this idiotic sci-fi thriller is that the actors do not crack up when delivering their lines.
0,"The premise is promising all right, but it's a movie over-stuffed with talk and actors with a glazed look as though they too aren't sure of what they're doing."
0,"There isn't a single word in the English language that could justly convey the sheer stupidity, and impenetrable complexity, of Push."
0,Push is a chase film dolled up with supernatural powers and chintzy retro design motifs.
1,"McGuigan's saving grace is a willingness to slow down and savour his own images. At best, a moody inconsequence takes over and confusion feels like part of the plan."
0,"Light fixtures are the true stars in ""Push,"" constantly reflecting, twinkling and popping. Its best moments are when guns levitate and fire themselves. When you don't even need actors to hold pistols, it's the ultimate in autopilot filmmaking."
0,"Set and filmed on location in bustling Hong Kong, the tight urban street and winding alleyways suit the film perfectly, but this is not enough to save Push from the Oscar season garbage dump."
0,Push is an empty calorie extravaganza and demands a crooked concentration it doesn't earn to sufficiently piece this mess together.
1,jThe script has no deep meaning and the film does just what it was intended to do: take an audience on a fantastical journey with loads of action.

0,"Ambitious, but alarmingly confusing thriller set in Hong Kong."
0,Felon flounders in convincingly resolving its protagonist's plight.
1,Former stuntman Rick Waugh turns writer/director to make a compelling and gritty drama that is as much a commentary on America's failed justice/prison system as it is about the devastation suffered by an honest family man imprisoned for killing a burglar
1,"The stuff that happens in a tense, taut new movie called Felon is nothing less than electrifying."
1,Felon gives everyone their tidy and expected due but outlines a realistic enough cycle of how a man's life can easily spiral out of his control.
0,"While the film is violent and decidedly tragic, the overall sensation of watching it is nothing you haven't experienced before with numerous films, from Death Warrant to Lock Up to Oz."
1,"Directed with pounding energy by Ric Roman Waugh and acted to the hilt by a cast comprising several of yesterday's stars proving their mettle, the movie delivers the thrills and emotion that prison movies require."
0,
0,Felon ventures outside the prison walls so often that the audience doesn(TM)t get a prolonged sense of the claustrophobia of confinement; the rage being displayed actually dispels the sense of isolation and boredom.
1,"Kilmer and Dorff, who was also an executive producer, immerse themselves in difficult roles and the film's overall air of social commitment will surprise viewers drawn in by its exploitation-movie promotion."
1,"Tough, brutish prison drama with an easy windup, but good acting and an uncompromising take on the prison system."
0,"Written and directed by Ric Roman Waugh, and filmed at the New Mexico State Penitentiary near Santa Fe, Felon is one of the most realistic prison films ever made."
0,"A good cast and disciplined direction add some distinction to Ric Roman Waugh's Felon, which is basically the old tale about an innocent man corrupted by a stay in prison."
0,A subplot involving corrupt guards makes the movie even duller than the score that sounds like a rusty squeezebox.
0,"For a film that seems to pride itself on its depiction of prison-reality, it feels extremely movie-phony."
1,"Stephen Dorff's powerhouse perf as an ordinary Joe trapped behind bars with warring ethnic psychopaths propels ""Felon"" well ahead of its expose/exploitation brethren while still avoiding the pious learning curves of Frank Darabont's prestige prison dramas"
1,"This tough, uncompromising, cautionary thriller should be a wake-up call about America's outrageously archaic laws insofar as defending the sanctity of home and family."
1,"Dorff, who was last spotted as a scary sexual sadist in Shadowboxer, gives a mesmerizing performance evolving from stunned civilian to brutalized inmate and dangerous prison thug, then transforming into a tested man who rediscovers his own humanity."
1,"...establishes itself as a gritty, thoroughly compelling prison drama that rarely relies on the various tropes of the genre."
1,"It's still white-knuckle tense, and held together by dozens of small, well-observed moments."
1,"The plot expands and gets more complex as the story progresses, and the dramatic tension ratchets up"
0,
1,
1,"Explores how violence is endemic in the prisoner, no matter their background, almost as soon as their sentencing is handed down."
1,"An emotionally intense and powerfully strong film that assails one's sensibilities and mores, ... FELON touches our hearts and our minds, humanizing what and who many perceive as inhuman."
0,
0,"Scar is a generic slasher; even it seems jaded with the 'torture porn' bandwagon onto which it leaps, ultimately feeling like WAZ for dummies."
0,Blood cascades out of the screen (Titanic - in red) when blades are not in your face. Desensitisation soon sets in: too like Halloween H20.
0,"The perspecto-effects are a real letdown, while the pacing and performances are as flat as roadkill."
0,"To make a 3-D 'torture porn' movie is at best opportunist; to make one with flat, boring torture scenes is unforgivable."
0,"This nasty, witless and hopelessly dated effort is still a landmark release. Think of it like the first dog shot into space, but don't forget it is an absolute dog."
0,"The acting is more wooden than the numerous coffins, the plot a rehash of any crazed serial killer flick you care to mention, with extra torture. It's unremittingly nasty stuff."
0,"Another week, another yucky horror film with a title that sounds like ""Saw"". This one's in 3D."
0,"Despite the killer's slavering way with a scalpel, there's no blood spurting out into your near-vision, just a lot of hopeless acting in your face."
0,"Despite it's technical savvy, this pans out as merely the latest in the dispiriting procession of torture porn movies while the dreary identification of the perp doesn't raise the excitement levels much higher than a half-hearted game of Cluedo."
0,"The result is humourless, implausible and lacks a single original idea. There would be no reason for this film to exist, were it not the first live action feature shot entirely in HD3D."
0,"If you make the mistake of going to see it, I recommend taking a spoon so you can scoop your will to live off the floor at the end. Derivative, dull and with a daft ending, even the 3D's not much cop."
0,This kind of torture porn is beyond bad taste.
0,"This boasts of being ""a first of its kind 3D movie event"", but it's just the same old torture porn tarted up."
0,"Run of the mill, largely predictable slasher movie that unfortunately squanders the 3D gimmick that could have made it interesting."
0,"As one character asks, ""It never stops, does it?"" Well, no. Not as long as people keep paying to see such dreck."
0,I'd read about this one for three years. Then I saw it and forgot it immediately.
0,"The sole high point? 3D tits. The porn industry is going to love this technology, presuming you don't mind wearing stupid dark glasses while masturbating."
0,"The Unborn is one of those movies evidently conceived by digging a Dungeons & Dragons Fiend Folio out of storage to find, resurrect, and rebrand some long-forgotten bugaboo."
0,"Well, there are some effective scares here, and you'll laugh at yourself afterward just for jumping and squealing like a little girl. But other images and pieces of dialogue are just as hilarious -- and that probably wasn't their intention."
0,"Exactly what you'd expect from the combination of its release date, genre, and MPAA rating"
0,"After three feature films of discouraging quality, Goyer suits up in a beret and jodhpurs again for The Unborn, which holds the miserable distinction of being the most dreadful film he's fashioned to date."
0,The Unborn is a mishmash of half-formed ideas more asinine and exploitative than frightening. At least the title is accurate; this junk is stillborn all the way.
0,Shouldn't have been brought to term.
0,"Even once the ""scary"" monsters start ramping up their appearances the film is still dead and Goyer's direction feels more like a trippy music video for some Eastern European techno band than anything out of a horror film."
0,has the psychological weight and perversity of a mildly racy episode of Touched by an Angel
0,"If the films released during the traditional January dumping ground are going to be this bad, we should employ the nation's best scientists to rearrange Earth's orbit so the year begins in February."
0,"If the use of Nazi atrocities as a MacGuffin for cheap thrills offends you, The Unborn isn't your movie. If, however, you appreciate the sight of a half-naked beauty being terrorized by potato bugs, look no further."
0,"Though some images are on the terrifying side, this mostly outlandish tale is riddled with homicidal tots, interdenominational exorcists, and attention deficit disorder dybuks who can't make up their mystical minds which body is cool enough to inhabit."
0,"Generic, underdeveloped and more silly than scary."
0,The year is only a week old and already the cinema gods have bestowed upon us a candidate for most awesome catchword of the year: Jumby!
0,"Unfortunately, ""Unborn"" is unscary"
0,Stillborn.
0,"It's hilarious, and it's sort of awesome, too, in that no-they-didn't kind of way..."
0,"Even for the run-of-the-mill, first of the year horror flick, The Unborn is pretty much a miscarriage."
0,An early contender for worst movie of the year.
0,"At least I got to see Gary Oldman, as Rabbi Sendak, blow the sacred animal horn."
0,"Filmed in Chicago but universal in its lameness...The Unborn is the story of a dybbuk who makes trouble for the skinny North Shore college girl played by Odette Yustman, who's always out jogging when she should be considering a sandwich."
1,"If you're the kind of horror fan who gets your kicks from phantasmagorical imagery and shivers at the thought of supernatural forces beyond our realm of comprehension, you could do a lot worse than The Unborn."
0,"A laughably bad horror flick involving demonic possession, concentration camps and torturous genetic experiments."
0,This is where many a horror movie falls and never again rises: too much exposition.
1,"Possession tale is low on blood, but high on scares."
0,"The movie's not very good, but there are ideas, good and bad, in its execution that are worth mulling over."
0,What darkness the movie achieves comes solely from the lighting.
0,"Before long, the connective tissue between scares starts to call attention to its own preposterousness."
0,"Unless we trudge up the aisle prematurely, we're stuck there, with nothing to do but count Oldman's changing accents or mourn that this is the best gig actresses like Alexander or Gugino can get."
1,The Unborn is a baby-sitter horror flick (it's for and about them) with classic creep-out elements that unite in a surprisingly engrossing story.
0,"At least writer/director David S. Goyer had the sense to boost these generic proceedings with pros like Alexander, Oldman, Elba and Carla Gugino, who plays Casey's mother in a series of embarrassing flashbacks."
0,"About the only thing here that will haunt your dreams is the film's final scene, which conveniently portends a sequel."
0,"I had nightmares about the trailers, which is unfortunate, because of a lot of films' best scenes are contained there."
0,"Laughable horror flick made from an unstable solution of Jewish mysticism, Nazi evil and an otherworldly demon."
0,"Writer/director David S. Goyer, whose niche as a screenwriter is in adapting comic-book tales, gets a few frightening images into the frame, but they're all one-off shocks that do nothing to build tension."
0,"The picture is such an embarrassment, Goyer has to be hoping that very few people will see it."
0,"The entire premise of The Unborn seems based on ""Boo! Gotcha"" moments, which are initially quite effective but soon wear out their welcome."
0,Parental Content Review
1,"A pretty young woman who looks especially fetching in her underwear is plagued by increasingly horrible dreams...at least, she thinks they're dreams until her whole life goes to hell. Some effective chills amidst the silliness."
0,"Using the Holocaust as the basis for a horror movie is pretty distasteful, but what offended me the most about The Unborn is how sloppy it is."
1,Somewhere Sigmund Freud is trying to figure out how he can come back from the dead just so he can analyze The Unborn! ...Crazy fun.
0,"Could have just as easily been called ""The Un-scary,"" ""The Uninspiring,"" ""The Unoriginal,"" or ""The Unexciting"". Whatever you do, just un-plan to see it this weekend."
0,Any intelligence gets lost in an unsatisfying ending that doesn't justify the brain cells lost while getting there.
0,"The film teeters so perilously and routinely at the edge of camp, both with some of its casting choices and some unfortunate dialogue...that it's hard to know if Mr. Goyer wants to make us howl with fear or laughter."
0,"...comes across like a Jewish version of The Exorcist, mixed with a touch of Rosemary's Baby by way of The Omen."
0,"After all, condoms are important, and maybe someday, if we're lucky, they'll come up with ones strong enough that even bad movies like this one can be shielded from impregnating theaters with their odious afterbirth."

0,pacing that allows the audience to linger on every failing before being distracted by the subsequent one
0,A ham-fisted attempt at a Semitic version of The Exorcist that is utterly unoriginal and totally devoid of actual frights.
0,The Unborn is so lame that even a scene where Nazi 'doctors' experiment on twin children by poking a needle in their eyeballs is more laughable than horrendous.
0,"The film's raison d'tre is a series of shock effects involving creepy kids, dogs with upside-down heads and a CGI-powered geriatric variant on Linda Blair's crab walk."
0,"At last we are making crappy horror films entirely on our own, without having to rip them off from Japan! U-S-A! U-S-A!"
0,"This is one film that shouldn't have been birthed. No, in fact, it should have been aborted."
0,"'This is the last time I'll write a movie on a roll of Charmin Ultra,' said Goyer."
1,"Goyer has penned many scripts superior to this one, but he does make sure you're never far away from a big 'Boo!'"
0,Falls very much line with early-year schlock.
0,A cheesy low-rent supernatural thriller that vainly tries to introduce some gravitas by dropping references to the Kabbalah.
0,"Not deep or all that visually imaginative--Goyer never wavers from the usual slow build-up to a sudden fright, and the ending is all fight-and-flight, no shock-and-awe--but certainly unboring."
0,...a salad of creepshow cliches...
0,"Gary Oldman steals what there is to take from his few scenes, but a nonsensical B-movie like ""The Unborn"" is beneath is skills as an actor."
1,"Like some Stephen King rewrite of 'The Reader,' this laughable but interesting movie traces its characters' distress to the Holocaust: Never forget, because 'Jumby wants to be born!'"
1,"It has a few really interesting ideas in it and a few good, old-fashioned scares (and very little camera shaking)."
0,"The film's story is not so much plagued by plot holes as it is constructed out of them, not unlike an especially lacy variety of Swiss cheese."
0,"Every January, as the ""January junk"" makes its annoying appearance on the big screen, a lackluster PG-13-rated horror movie is involved. 'The Unborn' is that movie for 2009."
0,"This orgy of crazed effects, cheap scares and jittery suspense never remotely frightens us"
0,both silly and nonsensical
0,"Odette Yustman, indeed all the cast, deserve a better fate than to be sucked into this misguided attempt at horror"
0,Goyer's psychic dream sequences are pretty good - what a pity he decided to ruin them with a movie.
0,"Well made, but ultimately underwhelming horror that never really comes to life, despite some creepy visuals and a handful of cheap shocks."
0,"The script tries hard to delve into the folklore of a dybbuk, and as it mixes this in with experiments on twins in concentration camps during WW2, the story becomes too convoluted for its own good."
0,"Despite some gruesome special effects, the telling of this story is so prosaic and predictable that genuine thrills are in very short supply."
0,"David S Goyer's non-kosher riff on 'The Exorcist' is stillborn,"
0,"Brazen in its borrowings and alternating between cynicism and silliness, this is a creatively barren effort that should have been stopped at conception."
0,A scary movie so fantastically stupid and crass it made my skull contract and my sinuses harden to the consistency of pipe-cleaners.
0,The Unborn becomes rapidly tedious even as the body count racks up.
0,"Over-egged and underwhelming, the best thing that can be said it that it provokes a few shocks - but these are easy wins and play no part in the propelling the plot along."
0,"Hampered by the 15 rating, director David S Goyer is reduced to yawn-worthy jump-scares and recycled Exorcist gags to do his dirty work."
1,"Despite some massive flaws and a disappointing over-reliance on jump scares, The Unborn is comfortably the best entry yet from Platinum Dunes, Michael Bay's previously remake-happy horror production outfit."
0,"The Unborn is, like its main character, at war with itself. Neither side wins."
0,It's hard to imagine a more ham-fisted attempt at the genre of 'womb horror' than this flat-footed supernatural drama with a Jewish twist.
0,Unborn should have been strangled at birth.
0,"A ham-fisted horror movie that manages to put together deadly demonic possession, Nazi concentration camps and nasty wartime genetic experiments."
0,Less spine-chilling and more eye-drooping.
0,This supernatural horror is nonsense on toast.
0,"The demonic possession plot thereafter breaks down in a tasteless swamp of Nazi experiments on twins, dogs with inverted heads and an exorcism led by rabbi Gary Oldman. Oy vey! The kosher paranormal: a trend in the offing?"
0,Think of every scary-kid horror you've seen - this was how The Unborn was made.
0,"Kabbalah meets The Exorcist in this hotchpotch hokum of vengeful ghosts, killer children, crazy old psychic ladies and supernatural Nazi experimentation."
0,"The screenplay by Goyer himself, who wrote Blade and co-wrote The Dark Knight, this time doesn't limber up."
0,This may dabble in Jewish mysticism and the legacy of the Nazi era but scratch the surface and you discover just another standard scary movie.
0,"Unsatisfying, hokey and never that scary (unless you're the type who jumps at every loud noise or sudden appearance in this sort of movie), The Unborn outstays even its brief lifespan."
1,"Packed with very scary moments and very disturbing images, this is not for the faint-hearted - that includes me."
0,"Some of the ideas here may seem original, if questionable, but the treatment -- by writer-director David Goyer -- is strictly conventional, with the shock moments obviously inserted at regular intervals, usually while the heroine is in her underwear."
0,"After a few initial decent scares, the corny dialogue, poor casting and cringe-worthy acting drag this movie into it's own hell. Utter rubbish."
0,"Cue a creepy toddler, various demonically possessed adults and a Jewish exorcism conducted by Gary Oldman. He's a vastly better actor than the film deserves, but he can't make the script seem even slightly better than it is."
0,This foolish film hitches an easy ride from the Holocaust.
0,"The Unborn isn't the worst horror film you'll see in 2009, but the prospect of a sequel (which the film teases at the finale), is probably the biggest fright in the 88 minutes."
0,Full of cheap thrills that mostly consist of people popping up out of nowhere and dialogue comprised largely of theological gobbledygook.
0,'Tis the season of the Hollywood dumps -- which is too bad because I had harbored some small hope for this latest horror offering from David S. Goyer.

0,The Unborn is like a scary movie sentence without the necessary linking verbs. It's all genre gears and no motivational motor.
0,...boasts few attributes designed to initially capture the viewer's interest...
0,"There is a senseless scare every 5-7 minutes. Now, after one or two you start to get the giggles but after the third or fourth false scare you begin to Laugh Out Loud."

0,Should have been aborted.
0,"The best that can be said for Goyer's latest is that it's competent. How competent is a matter of debate, as is the degree to which Goyer is self-aware about the film's camp value. [Blu-ray]"
0,"The Unborn is packed full of grisly images and effects, but its apparent attempts to be some kind of Jewish take on The Exorcist fail miserably."
1,"[An] exuberantly creepy mash-up of Jewish folklore, J-horror atmospherics, and demonic possession boilerplate."
0,Smoking-hot heroine. Clever paranormal premise. Painfully clueless conclusion.

0,"Unoriginal, unbelievable, utterly unwatchable."
0,"I kept hoping Oldman would revert to his Sid & Nancy punk persona and kick the little freak in the yarbles like some pain-deserving Springsteen fan, but no such luck."
0,"I truly, truly recommend watching either of those instead of The Unborn. Or your wall. Just staring at your wall is also an acceptable alternative too."
0,I don't know why I even bothered to watch this.
0,But the film's fundamental flaw is that these solid spooky moments hang on a narrative that's not nearly strong enough to bear their weight.
0,Overblown and underwhelming.
0,"In any other world, this would be getting a DVD or Syfy-only release, and Jacobson's talents would be better utilized directing Playboy Channel interstitials."
1,"Over-the-top -- and ultimately tiresome -- female mud-wrestling, kick-boxing and cat fights in a parody of old exploitation movies."
0,The target audience must be that awfully precise niche that never tires of women punching each other.
1,Hurt me some more.
0,"All the revealing costumes, Penthouse Letter structure, and girl nation rumbling can't cover the fact that Bitch Slap is an awesome idea handed the least effective execution possible."

0,The latest proof that calculated camp in the form of homage is nearly impossible to pull off.
0,"Like an issue of Maxim that flips its own pages, but keeps stopping to read the articles."
1,"It twists and twists and twists past the point of reason and logic. Best of all, it doesn't care. It just keeps going."
0,"If the film's half-baked salaciousness feels merely risible, its slapdash screenplay and cheapo look make it something that its generic forbearers rarely were: boring."
0,More suitable for background noise on a late night than an actual big event you can gather with your friends to watch...
1,"By far the best elements are the regular flashbacks, which showcase the crazy comic book vibe at its best and have some truly spectacular Charlie's Angels-style moments."
0,Just go watch Death Proof again instead.
0,It's an homage to the exploitation genre that doesn't pay full homage to the exploitation genre.
0,"Jacobson and Gruendemann appear determined to put the grind into grindhouse. And not in a good way. Everything goes on so long, including an excessively protracted catfight, that the viewer will be crying for mercy before the characters do."
0,"For all of its potentially 3D-appropriate use of flying objects and big boobies, ""Bitch Slap"" doesn't hold a candle to Russ Meyer's truly transgressive ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" - an obvious inspiration for this gutty little action film."

0,"American rugby is the setting for this earnest sausage party of macho posturing, bro-dacious life lessons and value-focused sportsmanship that give wayward teens the strength to rise above sinful temptations."
0,"Though director Ryan Little puts together a clean, professional package, at bottom this is a nearly-two-hour scrum of therapeutic direct encounters."
1,"While it does boast some of the expected tropes and formulas of cinematic sports dramas, it's a competent, entertaining and involving movie that features a decent message about self-discipline and redemption."
1,[Director Ryan] Little and cinematographer T.C. Christensen make you feel the heat in every scrum.
0,There's something disheartening about seeing real-life stories and their inevitable complexities put through the Hollywood sausage machine and transformed into bland parables.
0,"It's definitely possible to make artful message movies -- just consider the filmography of ex-Mormon iconoclast Richard Dutcher -- but Forever Strong is generic faith-and-redemption fare, devoid of nuance."
0,"As directed by Ryan Little and written by David Pliler, Forever Strong dredges up every sports movie clich and stereotype ever invented. (Cue the slow-mo in the rain.)"
1,"The movie is well shot and edited, the rugby scenes are enjoyable (if likely puzzling to the uninitiated) and Strong's earnestness excuses at least some of its predictability."
0,"Gives the word ""forgettable"" a bad name."
1,The very Tom Cruise-like Sean Faris makes this respectable portrayal noteworthy considering the gritty sport's irrelevancy to most Americans.
0,This earnest indie production comes across like formulaic fiction while taking cues (and recycling cliches) from the 'inspirational sports drama' playbook.

1,The father-son relationship that bolts this rugby film together provides the textured backdrop for a sports film that engages
0,"Created under the vague guise of ""inspirational cinema,"" Strong is a sloppy, soggy pile of clichs, unable to sort itself out, grow a pair of cinematic cojones, and actually try to subvert some of its rancid formula."
1,Uplifting jock drama is predictable but OK for older tweens.

0,A less tasty martial-arts actioner featuring an autistic kickboxing queen energized by confectionery.
0,JeeJa Yanin is a sensational discovery but this mixed assortment of high kicks and even higher melodrama may be an imperfect vehicle for her.
1,"The heart of the film may be its action sequences but, even outside the battle arena, 'Chocolate' is a nicely characterised and consistently likeable piece of work."
1,Another symphony of exquisitely choreographed carnage.
1,Is it radical or offensive? I really don't know. It certainly got my attention.
1,"Don't bother looking for wires and safety nets because there aren't any. As the end credits show in wince-making detail, all the performers genuinely suffer for their art."
1,"It's likely to be drooled over by fans of the genre and no doubt enthused about by Quentin Tarantino. But if kung fu ain't your thing, this won't convert you."
1,"Unfortunately, the martial arts action is only half the movie - the rest is badly acted and gory."
1,"A bizarre, often tasteless, but never dull Thai martial arts movie."
0,"The slightly slushy plot is really an excuse to catch your breath between the action sequences, which are fast, loud and crammed with references that only Bruce Lee fans will properly appreciate."
1,"Reminiscent of early Jackie Chan flicks, an action-packed, pick-and-mix of punch-ups include a cheeky tribute to Lee's legendary icehouse scene in The Big Boss, culminating in a spectacular multi-storey jaw-dropper."
0,The director makes sure we know that it all proves how people with special needs can triumph.
1,"Yes, it's extremely choppy and not terribly well-developed, with characters appearing and disappearing at random. But the fights are so impressive that we can't help but be thoroughly entertained."
1,Enjoyable thriller.
1,Chocolate gives us the first autistic action hero.
1,"The world may not have needed a Thai-language martial-arts hybrid of Kill Bill and Rain Man, but by God, it's got one now."
1,"The finale is an extended tour de force equal parts Bruce Lee, Tony Jaa, and Donkey Kong."
1,"... the fights are terrific, tightly choreographed with a good sense of ensemble movement and shot in long takes that preserve the fluidity of the action..."
1,It boils down to this: Thai girl fighting. Is that enough of a movie for you?
0,Chocolate is risibly sentimental even for a genre not known for its emotional sophistication.
1,"Takes its time to get going, but once the action kicks in, it's mildly engaging with lots of mindless fun, especially for avid fans of martial arts films."
1,"Even if it doesn't make much sense, tugs shamelessly at the heartstrings, and features a heavy with Jennifer Aniston hair, the feature sparks in just the right way, making for a fist-clenching, mouth-agape sit."
1,"Character development and cogent storytelling are in short supply. Yeah, so?"
1,"At its heart, Chocolate is a simple tale of a special girl trying to make her way in a considerably unspecial world."
1,
1,Vimistananda is nothing less than an awe-inspiring force of nature.
1,"Chocolate (Chokgohlaet) offers sensational martial arts set pieces -- beautifully choreographed, exquisitely colored, and acrobatically shot."
1,"It's called Chocolate, but Cheese would have been just as good. Soaked with tears, full of schmaltz, and yet strewn with bodies, Prachya Pinkaew's new kick-'em-up is extreme action, extreme melodrama, and extremely hard to resist."
1,"Anyone knows we all come here just to see the girl kick serious behind. At least she does just that, and after a while Chocolate mainly and plainly feels like the exhibition that it is."
0,"Ultimately there isn't much of a movie here, just a series of great-looking and expertly filmed showdowns that are worth the price of a rental"
0,"An evangelical bid to transform Satan's headquarters -- the multiplexes -- into ministries of religious healing between handfuls of popcorn, for Christian faithfuls. Though the actual target audiences are the sinners more likely to frequent blockbusters."
1,"If you've never heard of ""Fireproof,"" that could mean you are not a member of a faith-based community. On the other hand, it just might mean that you haven't stumbled upon this new release that packed Quad-City theaters over the weekend."
1,Christian-themed marriage drama won't grab kids.
1,"Geared for the same Christian audience that loved ""Facing the Giants,"" it is another winner for the Kendricks brothers"
1,"After a shaky start and a steady middle, the film ends on a genuinely moving note; the folks at Sherwood Baptist Church have made their most impressive movie yet."
0,"In the history of marital discord in the movies, has there ever been a blander conflict than the one between firefighter Kirk Cameron and his goodly wife Erin Bethea in the dismal Christian-themed melodrama Fireproof?"
1,This is a decent attempt to combine faith and storytelling that will certainly register with its target audience.
0,"With the production values of a straight-to-video cheapie and the script of a mediocre soap opera, Fireproof is good for just about one thing: dousing whatever flames might be left in your marriage."
1,"Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife."
0,Fireproof isn't merely preaching to the already converted; it's helping to further alienate the unconverted and the skeptical.
0,"You probably can't blame pastors moonlighting as moviemakers for wanting to pack their film with multiple messages, but the conversion subplot feels shoehorned into the more crucial marital doings."
1,"While hardly sophisticated in its approach and certainly not polished in its technical elements, the film does get its heartfelt message across with undeniable sincerity."
0,"Unfortunately, the emphasis on what God wants has a way of overwhelming who Caleb and Catherine are as characters."
0,"Fireproof stops becoming relatable to us all and only to the already, or easily, indoctrinated."
1,"...decently made, with good production values, sincere performances..."
0,It's one of the funniest films I've seen all year and that was obviously not the intention. This was made for elderly folk who watch Oprah and Dr. Phil and only see 2 movies a year. Embarrassing.
0,"The writing and directing Kendrick brothers, Alex and Stephen, have raised blandness and narrative predictability to the level of high art."
0,People like Kirk Cameron apparently require Scriptural instruction about how to not act like a complete **** to your wife.
0,"As a companion piece to a Bible study group this may have some merit, but it doesn't belong in a theater."
0,Parental Content Review
0,"Erin Bethea, on the other hand, doesn't have quite the range to pull off Catherine."
1,"This is a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music."
1,"A pure star vehicle, gliding along on charm and timing -- exactly the sort of comfort cinema Hollywood now seems incapable of making."
1,By turns exuberant and goofy and mushy and yearning.
1,"Big, colorful, delightfully dumb Bollywood ""gateway"" movie could be a perfect crossover vehicle for U.S. audiences."
1,"Cross I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry with the all-but forgotten 1970s farce The Gay Deceivers, then dress it up with elaborate musical sequences: Et voila!"
1,"Pic is largely sustained by the trio's screen chemistry, with Bachchan especially good at the louche comic stuff."
1,"Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer."
1,It's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling.
1,It's innocuous candyfloss.
1,"If you want a laugh, a good time out with friends, and some eye candy, Dostana is for you. If you are looking for a gay movie, this is not the right choice."
0,"Overall, this film is a mixed bag. Although there are comical moments, they're mostly variations on one joke. And that one joke is entirely dependent on caricature."
1,"It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India (where gay sex is still technically illegal), and does so using contemporary Bollywood's best not-so-secret weapon: star power."
1,The best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen in a very long time.
0,The director is obviously confused. The second half dips badly and he resolves the mess with a senseless copout of a climax.
1,"Only when Tarun [Mansukhani] gets emotion in, does the film start to drag. Mistake, because no one does tears like Karan. Ignore those bits, stay with the fun ones, and get laughing."
1,"It's tempting to call The Garden a story of innocence and experience, of evil corrupting paradise, but that would be doing a disservice to the fascinating complexities of a classic Los Angeles conflict and an excellent doc that does them full justice."
0,"It becomes clear that a more thorough, objective and serious journalistic approach was required once the story delves into the intricacies of the property's murky history."
1,"A beautiful portrait of a unique downtown LA community of poor Mexican-Americans who've turned urban blight into a marvelous garden and fight a developer determined to shut them down. A moving, inspiring documentary."
1,Presents a classic story of the little guy taking on The Man with both thrilling and frustrating results.
1,"An infuriatingly clear-eyed documentary...suspenseful and moving, a film that keeps you guessing (and hoping) right up until the conclusion."
1,"A documentary about fighting city hall, the empty promises of politicians, backroom deals, small victories over the Man and the cost paid by a handful of farmers who endured all of the above. Imagine if John Steinbeck rewrote the script for"
0,"The Garden does a fine job of promoting the power of grassroots advocacy; in almost all other respects, however, this is nonfiction filmmaking that's nearly as dull as dirt."
1,A political documentary that is as lovingly developed as the garden cared for by poor immigrants.
1,A heartbreaking documentary which landed a well-deserved Oscar-nomination for its touching portrayal of Spanish-speaking salt-of-the-earth who find it hard to fathom that the legal system could possibly side with a crook out to flatten the fruit of their
1,"Scott Hamilton Kennedy's plucky, powerful storytelling makes this a worthwhile experience."
1,"[Director] Hamilton captures the heart-wrenching devastation done in the name of profit, as citizens mourn. Incredibly effecting."
0,"The Garden is an especially fatuous documentary, nominated for an Oscar this year, about a community garden in South Central LA where Latino farmers have been allowed to grow food on somebody else's land."
1,A compelling documentary about an urban garden collective and their fight for justice in a nation where poor people are expected to keep quiet and not speak truth to power.
1,This intricate and compelling documentary paints a saddening portrait of American politics.
1,"The documentary digs deep into the racial and monetary problems of a tumultuous, melting-pot community."
1,"A compelling, inspirational, provocative and thoroughly engrossing documentary."
0,A good documentary leaves the viewer wanting more. A problematic one leaves the viewer needing more.
0,"Justice and Corruption and Profit are abstractions, and film is so ill suited to deal with abstractions."
1,[Director Kennedy] lets his subjects tell their tales in their own words. And that's what really makes the film interesting.
1,Likely to grab your heart and incite your passions.
1,"The Garden moves beyond the feel good facet of any apparent ending to show how stark, stupid reality can rip said victory away. It won't make sense - none of these 'us vs. them' situations ever do - but it does create compelling cinema."
1,an interesting film simply for the complexity of this issue
1,"If ever there was a micro/macro analogy for the mess we're in with this beaten down old planet, Scott Hamilton Kennedy's film about the farm in South Central L.A. is as good as it gets."
1,"It's easy to tell what side the filmmaker takes, which leads to unanswered questions... [Director Scott Hamilton] Kennedy's compelling documentary is quite thorough otherwise."
1,"The creature feature is loaded with blood, guts, gore, the perfect anti-hero and a hilariously fun plot, which is played straight until the very end...Wilkins delivers a simple, yet effective '80s creature feature that's not only scary, but also a great t"
1,"Splinter's got all the elements that make for a great midnight movie, something horror fans will be telling one another about for weeks, maybe months, afterwards."
1,"Once audiences get over snickering at a creature that they initially write off as a rabid hedgehog (too bad that Geoffrey Rush film already snatched up the title Quills), they'll be happy to strap in for a satisfying ride."
1,...delivers the year's best beast -- a spiny fungus that turns its victims into zombiefied walking pincushions.
0,"Whenever a romantic couple in a movie goes camping in the remote woods, you just know it's a bad idea."
1,"Spare, effective and genuinely frightening."
1,"A high-end feature-length version of The Outer Limits, combined with a fond enthusiasm for creative gore and populated by a trio of characters who are actually interesting."
1,Splinter has a hackneyed gimmick -- dead bodies trying to smash their way into an isolated convenience store -- but I loved it to pieces.
1,Exactly what a B-movie should be.
1,A nifty horror movie that doesn't claim to be anything other than a zippy exercise in creature-feature entertainment.
1,a nifty example of the horror-movie as thrill ride
0,This is one tedious horror film.
1,"This is classic Halloween fun, with plenty of thrills and chills, surprisingly believable performances, and healthy doses of humor."
0,"The ingredients are all there: a small, virtually unknown cast, a remote location, a nasty critter -- but the seasoning is all off."
0,The film lacks that spark of originality or humor or thematic resonance that might have elevated it from forgettable genre time-passer to something more lasting.
0,Splinter is about a scary as a tussle between four vacationers and a small porcupine.
1,"Bloody, screamy, creepy crawly comfort food that cuddles B-movie horror convention without fatigue."
1,"If you've seen The Thing or The Evil Dead, you've seen much of Splinter, but it's a lean, fast-moving and fun little flick that doesn't waste any of its scant 82 minutes."
1,"Excelling in creative scaring skills, Splinter boasts thorny issues like psycho fungi who go mobile, nuclear hedgehogs, homicidal human porcupines, impromptu carnivorous rooftop dining on half a state trooper, and a dangerously defrosting savior on ice."
0,This slightly elevated generic effort is still essentially what they mean by disposable entertainment.
1,"[Director] Wilkins understands that what we don't see is often more unsettling than what we do. But he also throws in plenty of well-earned gore, making this an ideal option if you're looking for a few new Halloween scares."
0,"There have been worse horror flicks, but although this one offers a few scares, it doesn't have a lot of imagination."
1,"The movie's awash in blood, sure, but it has more brains on hand than just the ones dripping down the wall."
1,"It's short, taut, nicely shot, well-acted, astutely directed, specific where it might have been generic, original enough to be engrossing and derivative enough to be amusing."
1,"With Splinter, the director Toby Wilkins honors the conventions of the horror genre with skill and enough wit to keep the scares sharp."
0,"Fans hoping for a substantial work are left with no real statement or vision, while horror aficionados have already seen this film a dozen times before."
1,Four people. One Kwik-E-Mart style shop. One crazed creature. Splinter proves that's all you need for a chilling horror movie.
1,This is a terrifying film.
1,"It's good, it's just nothing really groundbreaking or special."
1,"If you can get beyond one basic narrative flaw, and a low budget dynamic which provides limited looks at our Bottin-inspired fiends, Splinter will come as a wonderful little fright flick surprise."
1,"deliver[s] plenty of bang from the filmmaker's limited bucks - but Splinter's greatest strengths, rare for the genre, are its solid characterisation, witty dialogue and charismatic performances."
0,"Everything you expect to happen, does - but it isn't satisfying."
1,A very efficient and effective (for its budget) zombie-infection-sci-fi-thriller
1,
1,"Splinter earns our respect while delivering 82 minutes of lean, mean fun."
1,I'm ready for the sequel but with the tension and fear factor amped up tenfold!!!!
0,"It may find itself a cult following, but in a genre full of similar movies, it is more likely that Splinter will be assimilated just like its victims, and forgotten."
1,"Playing identical twin brothers who have landed on very different ends of the personality spectrum, Norton gives two bravura comic performances, shoulder-to-shoulder..."
0,An identical twins comic crime drama goes seriously wrong.
0,"One Edward Norton performance is often enough reason to see a movie, so it comes as no surprise that the prospect of two -- he plays twins -- is very much the main attraction, and reward, of Leaves of Grass."
1,"...worth checking out if only for Norton's phenomenal, Oscar-worthy turn as the film's diametrically opposed twins."
1,"Writer/director Tim Blake Nelson manages a finely tuned balance that is rare in cinema. Moving from the far reaches of comedy to the nether regions of drama, he never skips a beat or sets the pitch too high."
1,"Meant to blow your mind when not pulling your leg, the film has some surreal surprises in store. Like homicidal potheads, a Jewish menorah wielded as a deadly weapon, and a suspicious swastika scrawled backwards at a bible belt synagogue crime scene."
1,"Heady stuff, but plot feels forced rather than organic."
1,"Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass is some kind of sweet, wacky masterpiece. It takes all sorts of risks, including a dual role with Edward Norton playing twin brothers, and it pulls them off."
0,"Messy genre jumbling has rhyme and reason in Leaves of Grass, as it speaks directly to the film's portrait of life's unpredictability and uncontrollability."
1,...a thoroughly independently minded movie that plays loose at putting across big ideas.
0,Suddenly abandons all comedic promises and turns into a sadistic action film...a textbook example of a promising movie that takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers.
0,"The movie is a showcase for digital technology and for Norton's virtuosity, but I wish it weren't such a weightless shambles."
1,"Leaves of Grass is part goofy drug comedy, part shocking bloodbath. It's a riot of tones and genres, but unlike that other recent hybrid, Pineapple Express, the parts add up to something larger."
1,"The movie bubbles with intellectual curiosity and narrative ambition. And for that I dig it, even if Leaves of Grass has the habit of swerving and sometimes lurching from tone to tone."
0,"It's just another oblique backfire from Tim Blake Nelson, whose work as a writer-director in general wallows in a bog of mediocrity."
0,"It would be overly polite to call this a pale shadow of the tone-shifting Coen brothers farces from which Nelson -- who costarred in O Brother, Where Art Thou? -- is taking his cues."
0,a fitfully enjoyable but unsatisfying playground of ambition and occasional wit
1,"Edgy, intelligent and unusual. And also uneven. [It] has so many good things going for it, though, that while you can't overlook the flaws, you might be willing to forgive them."
0,"The picture loses its mind on an abrasive hunt for irreverence, twisting something securely oddball into an affected, unnecessarily toxic tale of brilliant knuckleheads living up to their Tulsa potential."
1,
0,"It's not the violence itself that bothers me, it's just that it completely destroys the tone of the movie."
0,You could get whiplash from his movie's mood swings.
1,Emerging director Tim Blake Nelson takes another step up with this comedy drama starring Edward Norton in what might go down as Norton's best performance yet.
1,"This is Tim Blake Nelson's affectionate and curious vision of his native Oklahoma, and what he sees makes for a uniquely restless, ribald motion picture."
1,"The mirror image gag is one of the oldest in the book, and yet, if done well, it never really gets old."
1,"As a writer-director, Nelson keeps the laughs coming at a steady pace, and never condescends to his articulate redneck characters."
1,"Mr. Norton is a pleasure to watch, and so is everyone else."
1,"... through it all, the two performances by Edward Norton feel natural, relaxed, utterly unlike a gimmick."
0,"Suffice to say that Blake Nelson doesn't have the visual gifts of his Minnesotan mentors, leaving us undistracted by surface flair and fully focused on his cartoonish characters and ragged, oddly callow script."
0,Many clich챕s in uneven and odd mix of guffaws and philosophical analysis. . .[C]onsiderable violence surprisingly erupts...[M]ost fun is watching Norton interact with Norton.
1,"It's a jarringly realistic hybrid that echoes the more surreal aspects of real, rural life, and Norton walks/ambles through it all, sporting dueling personalities and distinct accents, but one very serious heart."
1,An offbeat thriller that is deepened -- rather than derailed -- by its tricky shift from darkly funny to just plain dark.
1,This is a very personal film from Nelson that is jam packed with ideas and heavily influenced by the Coen Brothers...
1,"The DVD extras give the film a boost with a well done ""making-of"" featurette and a commentary of the film by director Nelson, star Norton and producer William Migliore."
1,"Essentially Deliverance cross-bred with A History of Violence...Leaves of Grass is a peculiar rural yarn and a sweet, assured examination of lost innocence and brotherhood that succeeds largely because of Norton's multi-faceted performance."
1,"Maybe too small-scale to be anything truly special, but an original and witty film that both surprises and entertains."
0,"I could only bear 35 minutes, and I haven't walked out of anything since 'You, Me and Dupree.'"
0,really unbalanced
1,"It's well put together, colourful, typifies Indian culture and values, is very emotional, and is a typically numbing 3 hours long. Ticks all the boxes then..."
0,"In effect, the oppressed Taani is allowed to open up but the repressed Surinder is not, which hardly seems fair."
1,"This agreeably amusing comedy/romance/musical is Another Mash-Up Made by Bollywood. Writer-director Aditya Chopra's film suggests a star-powered Billy Wilder love farce, Grease and Shall We Dance."
1,"Smart, colorful and well-acted Bollywood romantic comedy succumbs to sentimental wish-fulfillment toward the end, but could still teach Hollywood rom-coms a thing or two."
1,Leave it to Shahrukh Khan to make what sounds preposterous on paper to be both hilarious and emotionally involving.
1,Aditya Chopra's romantic comedy could teach Hollywood a thing or two about breathing life into hoary cliches.
1,"Silly, lightweight, overlong and unoriginal; this is nevertheless shameless romantic entertainment that will undoubtedly be a hit. Welcome back Raj!"
1,You have to leave the theatre with a goofy smile.
0,"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi has some sparkling moments, featuring Surinderji Sahni. The rest is done that, seen this. Are there any new ideas left in the Yashraj [Films] chest? Now is the time to delve deep."
1,"It's contrived and predictable, formulaic and derivative, yet The Proposal has its own charm. Star charisma is part of it, but there's an interesting dynamic between the two leads. The set up is fun, too."
1,It is about as pleasing a star-driven comedy as one could reasonably expect to open in wide release during the dog days of summer.
1,"It's doing the same old thing but seems to know it, and so does its best to find something new buried in those clich챕s."
0,Humor and romance are interspersed so predictably it's as if screenwriter Pete Chairelli were working from a rom-com checklist.
1,Director Anne Fletcher keeps the romantic comedy running with a bubbly spirit and a snappy pace.
1,Diverting romantic antic about a sham engagement is sparked by the bright chemistry and comic timing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.
0,A likeable romantic comedy featuring two charismatic leads who can't quite escape the shackles of a predictable storyline.
1,"The Proposal won't catch any bouquets for originality, but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops."
1,"Sandra Shock: Bullock partners well with Ryan Reynolds, their romcom strengths sailing above any of the weaker options put forward by this decent Proposal."
0,"The lure of Reynolds' and Bullock's nude scene together is sure to fill cinema seats (and raise a smile), but the other 106 minutes of The Proposal prove utterly forgettable."
0,"You know every tinny beat and false note by heart, from the implausible setup to the sprint-to-the-airport finish."
1,"With Ms. Bullock playing a lady only a polar bear could warm up to and Ryan Reynolds' exquisite balancing of the dynamics of the situation, this romantic comedy finds a sweet comfort level."
1,An old-fashioned romp reminiscent of the best of Doris Day and Rock Hudson!
0,"this is sort of an object lesson in what's wrong with comedy today. The first 15, maybe 20 minutes of this film was really promising... And then it all falls apart because they bring in all these silly, farcical things."
1,"Director Anne Fletcher knows where the comedy lies in an improbable but cute screenplay by Peter Chiarelli, it's in her two stars and she lets them fly."
1,The Proposal works up such a fun vibe that you couldn't care less about the contrived schematics of its story.
1,"The stars aren't going to erase memories of Hepburn and Tracy, or Lombard and Powell, but Bullock and Reynolds - even when playing a naked bathroom scene together - make a good fit."
0,"The Proposal could have been much smarter, and much hipper. Instead, it settles for silliness and sentimentality."
1,"Bullock's longtime fans should be happy to see her fully engaged in a role that suits her and paired, at last, with her comic equal: Reynolds."
1,The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible.
0,Classic screwball comedies knew how to get antagonistic lovers to fall for each other without having to resort to bathos; one wants to send first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli to an all-day Howard Hawks film festival.
0,So we've got a prodigal son who has the chance to deal with his father issues and discover things about his heretofore evil boss. It's like a romantic-comedy clich챕 twofer.
0,"All the romantic comedy conventions are shamelessly on parade in The Proposal, trampling on our brains and turning them into mush."
0,Every scene between Bullock and Reynolds only suggests how fine they might be in good circumstances.
1,"Bullock is one of those actresses that help prove that, when done right, a romantic comedy can be a wonderfully satisfying thing."
0,[C]ontrived... shameless in its cheap pandering... descend[s] to its most slapsticky just as it's maybe about to touch on some genuine feeling as if it assumes its audience has the emotional maturity of a kindergartner...
0,"It sounds like a faint recommendation, but trust me when I say that calling it ""not terrible"" is high praise indeed."
0,"The Proposal is a standard-order, by-the-book romantic comedy that offers nothing remotely fresh or new while following a formula even neophytes know by heart."
0,"Am I huge fan then of the finished product? No, not really, but I am absolutely sold on Bullock and Reynolds making more movies together."
0,"Fletcher's labored, downright desperate efforts at wringing laughs out of hopelessly stale material results in a series of entirely needless sequences..."
1,"Romantic comedy fans will get what they want and, at least this time, those pleasures are a little less guiltier than usual."
0,Parental Content Review
0,"Yet another formulaic romantic comedy, with little to offer except sparkling performances from Bullock and Reynolds."
0,"has fleeting moments of hilarity and charisma, but ultimately falls flat as a romance, comedy and drama with an inane, sitcom-ish, uninspired and lazy screenplay along with sloppy editing and direction."
0,"The Proposal's a fairly good-natured but weak proposition -- it's a movie you might enjoy on an evening's date, but it's not one you'll want to spend the rest of your life with."
0,"...may not be the worst romantic comedy ever made, but it surely is one of the most unnecessary...plays like a patchwork of everything from ""Men in Trees"" to ""Chuck and Larry."""
1,"The Proposal coasts along on likability, right up to its standard-issue ending; what it doesn't do is surprise us in any way."
1,"Though it falls short of winning our hearts completely, The Proposal is a serviceable and intermittently funny romance made enjoyable by the sparks between Bullock and Reynolds."
0,"And though Bullock and Reynolds have snappy chemistry to spare, their love affair stops just shy of being believable. There are too many awkward 'tender' moments and not enough vigor for a real romance."
0,"Hinging on the far fetched premise that if you put two people with zero chemistry in a room together long enough, they'll inevitably fall in love with each other, the movie is stolen away by Oscar Nunez's multi-tasking paunchy male stripper grocery clerk."
1,Surprisingly charming and smartly executed.
0,"Despite sparkling performances by Ryan Reynolds and Denis O'Hare, this derivative story has been made into too many movies not to be stale."
1,Never underestimate the pleasure of a sparkly screwball comedy - and a fluffy puppy.
0,Why a screenwriter would think hilarity would ensue from this premise is anybody's guess.
0,"Given the plot summary, you have to admit that anything better than 'I took my own life halfway through the screening' is impressive."
0,The problem is not the acting. The problem is what these actors are required to say and do.
0,"At every turn where The Proposal could have seemingly gone in a less obvious direction, it just puts on the blinders and forges ahead with the cliches of this genre."
1,"All this predictable, romantic/screwball comedy really has to do is supply us with a steady supply of laughs. And in that regard, the film succeeds."
0,"Just looking at the poster for The Proposal, a by-the-numbers romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, tells you exactly how it's all gonna go down."
0,A romantic comedy so numbing it feels like Novocaine.
1,"The setup is formula, but Bullock and Reynolds supply surprising fizz and kick."
0,"Bullock and Reynolds play off each other with a real zing and zeal, but the narrative journeys down an avenue so formulaic the viewer's heart shatters at the very realization of it."
0,"Sluggish when it should be scintillating and sappy where it should be sardonic, this romantic comedy winds up more softball than screwball."
0,"Following 27 Dresses, this is the second high-concept, low-impact, wedding-themed comedy in 18 months for choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher. It might be time to move on."
0,Were it not for the jangly screwball energy ... The Proposal would be just another desperate attempt to jam as many winning formula elements into one graceless package as possible.
0,"Though there's definitely an audience for the story's increasingly sunny sweetness, the film sparks to life pretty much only when the estimable duo of Bullock and Reynolds bickers."

0,"Oh Sandra Bullock, why do you do this to yourself?"
0,"The leads are appealing, the material familiar -- it adds a Front Page romantic angle to The Devil Wears Prada, and reworks ideas from Green Card."
0,"Somehow, someone decided this rom-com needed less rom and more com -- a fatal mistake."
1,"The Proposal recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out. You see it coming from a great distance away. As it draws closer, you don't duck out of the way, because it is so cheerfully done, you don't mind being hit by it."
1,"A high gloss, studio Romcom with clich챕d jokes and conflicts that are as uncontroversial as they are predictable, The Proposal is rooted in the most classical of conventions and still finds ways to be surprisingly enchanting."
1,"Despite the fact The Proposal is predictable and stuffed with recycled schtick, it's surprisingly enjoyable and completely charming. If it was a baby, you'd want to pinch its little cheek -- it's that cute."
0,Did you ever notice that the best romantic comedies are often the cynical ones?
0,"Regardless of the changes in setting and leading men, this is still Bullock running off the same old battery, and the fatigue is becoming increasingly difficult to cover up."
1,"Even though I was able to figure out the ending just based on my knowledge of romantic comedies, the film still delivered decent laughs and good chemistry."
1,"Bullock and Reynolds play against type well, and their spicy chemistry is contagious. But while the leads are doing their thing, Betty White slips in and steals the movie."

1,"Thanks to casting and chemistry, this is the first great romantic comedy of the summer."
1,Bullock and Reynolds' chemistry propels charming romcom.
0,"It's impossible to guess why Bullock was ever attracted to this insulting role, and the eternally confident Reynolds is miscast as a young, bullied underling."
1,"Shamelessly derivative, contrived and predictable, The Proposal is nonetheless a crowd-pleasing romantic comedy."
0,"A mostly harmless, completely unsurprising romantic comedy."
0,"There are spit-takes and lies; small dogs and mishaps. And, to cap it off, an impassioned dash to the airport. Seriously."
1,Without question this riotously funny flick is the year's best comedy -- at least so far.
1,"The Proposal is just a good old-fashioned romance, one in which people actually bring out the best in one another rather than the worst. How novel is that?"
1,"The bar for modern rom-coms remains depressingly low, but The Proposal clears it with ease."
0,"The movie's lazy, formulaic story quickly becomes an excruciating waste of talent."
0,There's nothing surprising here.
0,"The Proposal often lies flat where it should spark, with director Fletcher failing to maximize her talented cast's potential. The timing is off in several scenes, and a would-be outrageous character inspires more eye rolls than laughs."
1,"A romantic comedy doesn't need to be original to be enjoyable, and yet The Proposal still falls way too short of the mark."
1,"It's got spunk and charm and two skillful stars in Bullock and Reynolds, who make it all feel much less generic than it is."
1,"It isn't a film with a lot of big guffaws, but I smiled through most of it."
0,"Like most Hollywood romantic comedies these days, The Proposal is all about bringing a woman to her knees."
1,"Onscreen chemistry is an elusive notion but you know it when you see it, and Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds definitely have it in The Proposal."

1,The Proposal restores Sandra Bullock to comic glory. It's her best role since While You Were Sleeping.
1,"It's the undeniable chemistry %u2013 both romantic and comedic %u2013 shared between Reynolds and Bullock that ultimately carries ""The Proposal"" over its mediocre, formulaic writing and predictable plotting."
1,The Proposal gives some hope that the rom-com can still function.
0,"Anne Fletcher has practically established herself as the anti-feminist, playing more to the hopeless ring chasers out there rather than those who might be insulted at the prospect of independent women needing a man in their lives to complete them."
0,"In the end, nothing can compensate for the fact that Bullock has been so diligent in ridding herself of any trace of niceness that she looks as if she's regretting the whole thing. Boredom doesn't suit her and a romcom without charm just doesn't rate."
1,"Despite its less than original pedigree, The Proposal is a perfect example of a predictable, formulaic script elevated by fine acting and palpable chemistry."
1,The movie is a checklist of bad sitcom plots and generic romcom characters. But it's also funny and charming and cute.
0,"The experience of watching 'The Proposal"" is not unlike attending a performance from a cover band specializing in the songs of Billy Joel--both offer up the prospect of two hours of mind-numbing blandness without a single original element on display."
0,"Know this: There are no original romantic comedies anymore, only original people in them. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds make The Proposal a lot better than it ought to be."
0,Sandra Bullock is the paragon of a romantic comedy heroine ... So why does she find herself the star power behind so many romcom stinkers?

1,"While the picture occasionally goes out of its way to make Bullock's character a ninny, the actress refuses to let the role manhandle her, and she and the ever-charming Reynolds work well together."
0,"Once you've set your story up as a bedroom farce, resisting the form seems futile. The Proposal meanders toward a tone without arriving at one."
1,Bullock and Reynolds are appealing enough to make viewers care if real love will emerge from the legal ploy.
1,The chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds makes this good movie even better
1,"The Proposal is a delicious revamping of a Doris Day-like vehicle for Bullock (e.g. Pillow Talk). A virginal (or near-virginal), uptight heroine loosens up and finds true love after she discovers the man she has little patience for is her ideal mate."
1,I am going to do something I've never done before. I hope you're all sitting down....ahem. I am actually going to say something nice about a chick flick.
0,"For a woefully unconvincing summertime romantic comedy, it's not without a certain ramshackle, rickety old charm."
0,"A great example of moviemaking on autopilot. The screenplay not only heads for the predicable finish line, it also makes sure to hit all the predictable stops along the way."

0,Probably won't do you a permanent injury should you come into contact with it.
1,"It breaks no new ground, is predictable at every turn, and no one will remember a thing about it a week after they see it. All that said, The Proposal is above-average."
0,"The movie, duly enjoyable, joins a long list of Bullock's previous audience pleasing romance-centric films. For fans of Bullock and Ryan Reynolds' spectacular abs only."
0,There is a beacon of light -- Betty White. Ms. Betty could be cast in a revival of 'New Jack City' and you'd believe her in every frame.

0,"Sometimes, 'The Proposal' is rather engaging."
0,Bullock deserves better material and so do her fans. The moral: Don't accept a role unless you have read the entire script. Perhaps that's a more worthwhile proposal.
1,"Bullock and Reynolds ... end up elevating The Proposal, turning something old into something (almost) new, something borrowed into something cute."
0,They may as well have called this one 'Mis-Matched Sham Wedding Comedy #57513' for all the effort it makes to shake new life out of a tattered genre.
0,"Despite some fine performances and pretty scenery, The Proposal is predictable yet incredible, and devoid of any consistent tone. Better call off that wedding."
0,"Predictable rom-coms can work if the comedy and chemistry are there. Alas, both have gone AWOL. There's a dry and silent desert where the jokes are meant to be."
0,"One minute you're watching a 21st-century remake of His Girl Friday, the next you're having to endure some awful, dumbed-down ""women's picture"". Bullock deserves better."
0,"Sandra Bullock is teamed up with Ryan Reynolds, and each star's face has a waxy immobility that has nothing to do with Botox; the pure awfulness of the script has paralysed their facial muscles."
0,"The more recurrent noise towards the end was me groaning with disappointment, that a movie which had struck gold with its central matchmaking was succeeding so ruthlessly in taking the shine off."
1,"The Proposal is not a marriage made in heaven by any means, but the eventual charm of the leads and a gag-packed second half manage to salvage the movie from inauspicious beginnings."
1,"Ultimately, there is something refreshing about The Proposal's undemanding humour and unabashed feel-good factor."
1,"A pedigree cast, fun premise and punchy dialogue make Bullock's return to romantic comedy look a great catch, and Reynolds is sharper than a diamond solitaire. Pity, then, that its penchant for sentimentality makes it miss congeniality."
1,"The Proposal might not be ground breaking stuff, but it's a delightful and very enjoyable distraction that will lift your spirits."
0,"As a fish-out-of-water comedy, it's so lousy that you keep wishing someone would put the poor fish out of its misery."
1,Ignore the underlying fact that The Proposal is one big clich챕 of a movie and relish Bullock's ability to handle slapstick comedy as well as the smart line delivery.

0,So keen to be cute it curdles our stomachs and so anxious to be funny it jellifies our funny bones.
0,Another dagger in the back of romantic comedy.
0,"Despite some jolly, off-the-wall moments the comedy becomes increasingly desperate, relying on those old staples of fruity old relations, poodle-y pets in peril, 1980s pop dance offs and amusing, over-sexed foreigners."
0,"This turns out to be another bad choice for Bullock who, without playing badly, sinks in the general morass."
1,"Enjoyable romcom that succeeds thanks to the chemistry and comic timing of its two leads, but it's also formulaic, completely predictable and nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is."
0,"As brightly enjoyable as this film is, there's no escaping the fact that it's yet another formulaic rom-com."
0,"Dear Hollywood, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health . . . please stop parping out meritless tripe like this."
1,"For better or for worse, this could be a hot contender for the best romcom of the year. Might not be the most original, but it's certainly the most consistently funny and well played."
0,"It's not The Proposal's predictability that's the main problem, it's the lazy way it doesn't even try to cover up this predictability with witty jokes."
1,Sandra Bullock's performance alone deserves to give the star her first big comedy success since Miss Congeniality.
1,"At the Sandra Bullock Movie Factory, a Hunky Co-Star Assembly Line rivets a new head on a standard male muscular body per SB pic."
0,The sight of Bullock doing a rap dance with granny in the woods is a traumatising experience.
0,This is familiar territory crudely traversed.
0,"It is contrived and predictable, squandering the chemistry between co-stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as it creates lazy escapist entertainment that is forgotten as soon as the end credits have rolled."
1,A mildly enjoyed engagement that simply wasn't meant to last.
1,I was engaged by the fiery chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds.
1,There is something to be said for such a relentlessly by-the-numbers chick flick programmer that is nonetheless a breezily enjoyable sit.
0,"It's obviously formula stuff, and follows that formula so earnestly that at points you'll wince more than swoon (why does every big proclamation of love in the final scenes need to be made in public?)."
1,"The Proposal doesn't blaze any new ground, but it doesn't raze any old ground either. It's a solid, old-fashioned romantic comedy that's more interested in the romance than in being silly or raunchy. These days, that's refreshing enough."
0,"Unfortunately, this winning team is stuck in a dumb vehicle."
0,"Bullock is totally at home in this territory, and she remains fun to watch, but I do wish she would get stronger, possibly more original comedic material."
0,"Tailored to fit Sandra Bullock more snugly than the antique wedding gown altered for the star during the final act, the film begins to fall apart at the seams after its focus wanders from its promising screwball premise..."

1,... I do have to admit that I did laugh a few times.
1,"I found myself enjoying The Proposal more than I felt I should, chuckling at the predicaments and feeling the odd unsolicited tear moisten my eyes as if on cue in the third act."
1,"It's quite a testament to Bullock and Reynolds that despite all the implausible frippery, they still make you root for their characters. Mostly they make you root for them to be paired together again in a better movie."
0,More like a blind date from hell than a feel-good romantic comedy.
1,"Despite borrowing virtually eery rom-com plot device, screenwriter Pete Chiarelli keeps the dialogue crisp and witty."
1,...inevitably grows on the viewer...
1,"Gigantic is best appreciated for its kooky cast chemistry. But the story like the lure of those plump orthopedic mattresses in stock, is essentially a painless snooze."
0,"Director Matt Aselton cites Bu챰uel as an influence, but he fails to understand the difference between being a surrealist and being a nonsense-ist."
1,There's still something compelling about watching such a talented cast navigate the choppy waters of Aselton's world.
0,"The characters and situations are a little too quirky for their own good. Everyone is skewed off-center and, while that can be charming in small measures, Gigantic overdoses on it."
1,Credit Dano and Deschanel for generating sufficient chemistry to make the movie worthwhile despite the oft-distracting Kabuki dances dominating the backdrop.
1,"The various twilight performances of the veteran players deserve a look, as do the always interesting appearances of Mr. Dano and Ms. Deschanel. Only the sparks are missing this time."
0,It looks like it was made for one-half of Joan Crawford's old soundstage Pepsi-Cola budget and sounds like it was written by chimpanzees.

0,I don't remember ever wanting to just haul out and punch a movie before Gigantic.
0,"A note to all indie filmmakers (one that will be too late for Matt Aselton, writer (with Adam Nagata) and director of GIGANTIC): quirky is a tone, not a plot."
1,An oddball romantic comedy about the relationship between a nurturing male and a ditzy young woman who doesn't have a clue as to what she really wants.
1,"sinks under the weight of its peculiarities, making a possibly big story feel like no big deal."
0,Any resemblance the film bears to real people and real situations is purely coincidental.
0,Just a bunch of strange character traits strung together for no reason other than quirk.
1,For a film that only flirts with the idea of closure it may be best to just keep an open mind and enjoy the company of some fine actors playing funny characters trying to find the same answers that all of us are.
1,"If there's anything truly celebratory about Gigantic, it's the exposed performances from Dano and Deschanel."
0,"With curdled humor and cardboard characters, this ghastly movie completely misses the mark."
1,"Quirk fans, prepare to be lightly exhilarated."
0,"Seriously? Indie directors are still making painfully twee, self-conscious romances all these years after Sundance birthed so many quirky cliches?"
0,"With its off-center dialogue and upscale industrial settings, Gigantic strains to be original. But beneath its indie affectations it is really another contemplation of generational misunderstanding."

0,"Has a few moments of offbeat humor and boasts a charming, tender performance, as usual, by Zooey Deschanel, but it often falls flat as a convoluted comedy, drama, mystery and romance. It has too many poorly developed storylines that simmer together for 98"
1,There was just something about this movie that drew me in. Part of it is the borderline surreal method with which the film tells its story.
1,"The script is sharp, well written, and with some strong performances, especially John Goodman."
0,I felt like I was being hit over the head with a quirky club.
0,It's hard to imagine why anyone would build a whole film around Paul Dano -- or that anyone will again after seeing this movie.
0,"On the basis of Gigantic, Matt Aselton can make a fine and original film. This isn't quite it, but it has moments so good, all you wish for is a second draft."
0,"Anyone can go off and just cynically make a bad movie, but to make a picture as inert, incompetent and emotionally fraudulent as Gigantic takes sincere faith that one is, in fact, making something really, really good."
0,"Eventually Gigantic decides to become a heartwarmer, and why not? Any ending -- including nuclear devastation or a 1940s musical number -- would have worked, too."
1,"This quirky and engaging comedy sports smart dialogue, a surreal premise and a stellar cast."
1,"First-time feature director Matt Aselton, who co-wrote the darkly funny, well-observed script with Adam Nagata, has crafted a disarming tale that's one of the better independent films in recent memory."
0,Aselton's reason for making this movie is easy to discern -- he wants to be a filmmaker. But coming up with a reason for watching this movie is more of a challenge.
0,One of those indies that seems to be trying to top the quirkiness quotient of Juno.
0,There's nothing really appealing or funny about these people or the predicaments in which they find themselves.
0,"Gigantic plays like a Sundance movie with half the nouns removed; fetchingly cryptic for a while, it's ultimately just obscure."
0,"It's just not all that interesting to watch two pretty young things go through the muddled rituals of the pas de duh when I can, you know, do it just as poorly myself."
0,"Like committee-created sketches at comedy clubs, where the audience shouts out random, zany ideas, Gigantic is huge on the random. But unlike the comedy club, there is little, if anything, to enjoy."
0,"Aselton seems to have ingested a hundred forgettable indie comedies, regurgitated them, and applied the random title Gigantic to what came up."
1,Happy would be sad if you didn't want to see her story. And you wouldn't like a Manic Pixie Dream Girl when she's angry.
0,"Was there any idea that came to writer-director Matt Aselton while he made ""Gigantic"" that he didn't use? Seriously, that cutting room floor must have beenSPOTLESS."

1,"Not quite this year's hip little indie romantic comedy that could, as it clearly aspires to be, but smart-ish and drily funny while overly littered with twitches and tweaks."
1,"'Gigantic' is a film that succeeds by wearing the viewer down, as an infuriatingly coy, self-conscious first act gives way to a sweet and affecting climax."
0,"The kind of mumbling, lank-haired, achingly self-conscious indie rom-com that gives mumbling, lank-haired, achingly self-conscious indie rom-coms a bad name."
0,"It's slyly misogynistic, dramatically inert, and wastes an intriguing boorish cameo from John Goodman."
0,"This film is entirely empty: empty of substance, devoid of plausible characters, and without anything like a satisfying style."
1,"Here the characters drive everything - they're quirky without being annoying, funny without being clownish and odd but realistic. As funny and interesting as it is, however, the film raises more question than it answers."
1,"It's very hard not to get sucked in to the charm of this movie. Dano and Deschanel play their parts to perfection, exuding just the right amount of awkwardness and insecurity to bring the story to life."
0,"Everything that happens slots neatly into the art house template - wacky leads, wackier supporting players, coy alt-rock soundtrack - but director Matt Aselton doesn't know when to stop."
1,"Taking his cue from his leading man's minimalist, self-effacing performance, director and co-writer Matt Aselton has fashioned a wry homage to eccentricity."
1,"Yet there's an echo of Hal Ashby, or even Hal Hartley, in the subversion of easy truisms about relationships, and its primary note - mild anxiety - may make it a cult favourite."
0,"By the end, I was thoroughly alienated by the movie's twee, self-satisfied empty-headedness and rooting for the homeless man to do his worst."
0,"An indie comedy that's been kooked to a crisp. Wearing its quirkiness on its sleeve, the whole thing's just too self-consciously strange to engage."

0,"A likable cast brings some charm and humour to Gigantic but it remains an overly mannered, self-conscious effort."
0,"Fluctuating wildly between wry ironic chuckles and a sombre indie romantic drama, this never quite hits the right balance tonally."
1,"Likeable indie romance, thanks to strong performances and some nice ideas, though it's often a little too quirky for its own good and is almost derailed by a spectacularly misguided subplot."
1,"This gentle romance is so wilfully quirky that it will drive some audiences a bit crazy. But if you can connect to the film's warmth and the humanity of its characters, it really gets under the skin."
0,"This is some of the worst writing of the year, from the meaningless title down. Oh yeah, and a tramp keeps showing up to beat up Dano throughout. Not quite sure why, but I applaud the effort."
0,"It fails to either engage or appeal in a big way, a gigantic way even. It also lacks the required dosage of off-beat humour. And when the movie thinks it's funny, it is definitely not."

1,... a rousing documentary on the real costs of petrochemical dependence and the practical alternatives within reach.
1,"While Fuel takes persuasive swipes at the influence of oil-based energy companies over domestic and foreign policy, the film is more dazzling as an introduction to all kinds of clean energy alternatives many of us have never heard of."
0,"Fuel's message is clear -- oil is bad; alternative energy is good -- and its goals are simple -- put Big Oil out of business by selling the American public on the virtues of cleaner energy sources, such as wind, solar, ethanol, hemp, and world music."
0,Those outside the bio-church aren't likely to drive (at less than $2 per gallon) to see it at their local theater.
1,"Smartly animated interstitials, memorable archival material and a lively soundtrack round out the fast-paced proceedings."
1,Tickell makes his case in an entertaining and hence all the more effective manner.
1,One of the refreshing traits of this action-nudging documentary is Tickell's willingness to wrestle his own biases.
1,"For a film about energy, it's marvelous that Tickell ultimately gives us all the proverbial power."
0,Another fervent call-to-arms from one side of the aisle.
0,There's not a single (even moderately) dissenting voice in Fuel; you're either on the biodiesel bandwagon or raping the planet.
1,"It's a slickly enjoyable production (if unfocused and bloated), and his bullet-point tips are persuasive; but dude, there are better ways to humanize these issues than crying on camera."
1,"Thanks to an informative, buoyant tone and the director's own restless intelligence, the film preaches to the unconverted with passion, energy and graphics so clear that they would make Al Gore weep all over his PowerPoint."
1,"A peppy, bouncy documentary that is watchable and informative, although Tickell's celebrity name-dropping at times detracts from the serious message."
1,"A good natured cheer-leading session for clean vehicles, ""Fuel"" is several measures short of the intensity it will take to put Hummers where they belong---in museums."
1,"Tickell keeps the film hopping along, far more interested in the positive than a woe-is-us mentality"
0,"shows the not-so-shocking connections between the auto industry, the oil industry and the government, prescriptively offering alternatives ..."

0,Tonderai makes good use of soulless motorway catering venues - all white strip lighting and hunched zombie drivers - but overkills his tale with a succession of improbabilities.
0,The label slapped on the side of Mark Tonderai's low-budget horror movie has absolutely no bearing on the silly contents.
1,Mark Tonderai's debut makes for a smart calling card but relies on one tension-destroying clich too many and offers too few thrills to satisfy the hardened horror buff.
1,"For all of the convention and familiarity that Hush exhibits in the early going, it does a fine job of throwing a few wrenches into a generally predictable premise."
1,"Hush proves you don't need a Jason, Freddy or Michael to create a nasty little horror showcase."
0,"There's a nice twist or two in Hush and it's reasonably well-made but it feels like a TV movie or, worse, an extended TV episode of an anthology series."

1,One of Garbo's best and most affecting films.
1,"A slick, MGM production with a great cast but without much Tolstoy left."
1,
1,Garbo speaks again in one of her best.
1,Given the full glossy MGM treatment.
1,"In her 23rd film, Garbo's luminous performance, as the audlterous protag of Tolstoy's novel, is way above the mediocre level of the narrative and direction; the film is a remake of Love, in which Garbo starred opposite her then lover John Gilbert."
1,"Garbo, who also starred in the 1927 silent version of the Tolstoy story, is radiant and vulnerable throughout the film, the centre of the emotional storm that engulfs her."
1,"This lavish, MGM production surely excises some of the important details from Leo Tolstoy's novel, but makes up for it with the luminous presence of Greta Garbo and some gorgeous cinematography."
1,"On the whole, Anna Karenina is a picture of merit. It is decorative, well-meaning, and full of neat encounters, and it certainly presents a Garbo in the high summer of her maturity, richer and more mellow than she has ever been before."
1,"It is Greta Garbo's personality which ""makes"" this film, which fills the mould of the neat respectful adaptation with some sense of the greatness in the novel."
1,There seems more of anguish and more of sombre depth in this version than there was in the old silent film (with Garbo and John Gilbert). Garbo acts with a dignity and a bitter passion.
1,"If you still doubt either Hollywood's ability to deal with a masterpiece or Greta Garbo's greatness as an artist, this is the picture to see."
1,"Fine, fine, and super-fine, if the least bit archaic."
0,"With such a brief running time, it's difficult to create a convincing union - both during the moments of bliss and quarreling, which are equally rushed."
0,"Teasingly enjoyable rubbish through the first hour, Orphan becomes genuine trash during its protracted second half."
1,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra, working from a devilishly clever script by David Leslie Johnson, maintains steady suspense while mercifully mixing in some moments of dark humor."
0,"A pretty interesting movie about the crack-up of an American family lies right under the filmmakers' noses, but in their rush to deliver shock and gore they miss every opportunity to make a smart movie."
1,Orphan works because it's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be -- creepy as all get out -- and does everything possible to achieve that goal.
0,It feels too slow and moody for the Halloween crowd and too absurd and silly for more discriminating horror fans.
0,Just because Orphan is relentlessly bad doesn't mean it's not entertaining.
1,"...a persuasive addition to the subgenre of bad-seed-horror films like ""The Omen"" where a creepy little kid wreaks havoc and murder on the lives of ill-equipped adults."
1,"Nerve-shredding creepy kid home invasion alert, and takeout foundling traumas galore. Along with magnanimous curtsies, excessive doting on dad, stalking parental kitchen sex and, well, a tendency to bludgeon living things."
1,"I didn't mind wasting two hours watching the truly ferocious Furhman teach Max how to play Russian roulette and snickering when Kate thinks to Google ""children who kill."""
1,Sets up a series of increasingly queasy taboo points and then proceeds to rocket-cycle over them.
0,"Overlong and overwrought, Orphan stays faithful to every clich of the genre."
0,"Surely writers David Leslie Johnson and Alex Mace deserve their own circle of hell for thinking up the story, which moves with breathtaking cynicism from disturbing to grotesque to perverse to ludicrous."
0,What could be an interesting horror film just turns ... horrible.
1,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra (2005's ""House of Wax"") serves up a hoot of a trashploitation flick that both follows preset patterns and upends them."
1,One of the best entries in the cute-as-a-button-psycho-demon-child-from-hell subgenre.
1,"An unnerving psychological thriller with the atmospheric elegance of classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and Dressed to Kill, masterful in its blends of style and substance, violence and mayhem."
1,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra moves Orphan along efficiently, doling out a 'boo!' shot every few minutes with mechanical professionalism."
0,"If director Jaume Collet-Serra set out to make a parody of horror-film clichs, he succeeded brilliantly."
0,"Fifty years ago viewers were both shocked and riveted by The Bad Seed, and thirty years ago they went for the ride with The Omen, but to make such old-fashioned and trashy horror flick in 2009 is both courageous and bizarre, to say the least."
1,"During a summer with the usual transforming robots and young wizards, this chilly flick is a bit of a break, and there are worse options than letting this Orphan in the door."
0,"The problem with Orphan isn't merely that the film is idiotic--it's that it's also sleazy, formulaic and repellant."
0,"Despite director Jaume Collet-Serra's apt use of running children's laughter for jolt scares, the suspense generated from Esther's early lunatic behavior is of a mild, amusing variety."
1,A thoroughly enjoyable demon-spawn movie in the tradition of The Bad Seed (1956) and The Other (1972).
1,"Here is a shamelessly effective horror film based on the most diabolical of movie malefactors, a child."
0,"Pristine horror fodder had the script maintained some gumption and cheerfully waltzed into a wonderland of sleaze. Instead, it pulls every last punch...a seriously tasteless motion picture, but it's equally as spineless."
0,"House of Wax director Jaume Collet-Serra returns to the horror genre with Orphan, a clumsy thriller that elicits far more laughs than genuine scares. Like too many horror films these days, the movie is so rife with false scares or misleading"
1,"Solid lead performances and a moderately engaging premise make Orphan a slightly above-average evil-child movie with an infusion of Electra complex and a good, if half-hearted, narrative twist."
0,I would have laughed if the movie hadn't already sucked my soul from my body
0,"There's a surprise ending, followed by several bonus endings, and we're not giving anything away in noting that the film's titular adoptee has more lives than Chucky."
0,"Clocking in at more than two hours, the movie teeters between psychological horror and violent blood-letting and, as such, probably won't completely satisfy fans in either camp."
0,"While the third-act surprise twist of Orphan must have looked wicked-good on paper, on screen ... not so much."
0,"The scares are often the generic, push-off-the-slide variety and Orphan doesn't add much to the genre except, disturbingly, a fetishistic bent that's creepy in the wrong way."
1,"The stomach-knotting is kept taut throughout, and the acting is first-rate -- none more than Fuhrman, who seems to have the self-awareness and skill to be one of the best child actors around."
0,"Although reasonably, cheesily suspenseful, the movie takes a long time to get going. Its tagline, 'There's something wrong with Esther,' turns out to be a masterpiece of understatement."
0,"It takes too long to get started, it pulls some key punches, its dialogue is deeply uninteresting, it relies way too heavily on endless jump-scares and its finale is pure slasher-flick formula."
0,Scary-kid movies just aren't what they used to be.
1,"The film rests on Furhman's shoulders, and she's up to the task."
1,"As much fun as it is to follow Orphan's improbable developments, there is also a dark undercurrent that lingers with you afterward. It's that troubling theme that takes the movie from good to almost great."
1,"Occasionally sinks into ludicrousness, but has enough suspense, chills and surprises to keep avid horror fans viscerally compelled and ultimately satisfied."
0,"Oh, how I wish it were true that Orphan was a knowing parody, instead of an unwitting one..."
1,"The best thing about Orphan, is the way it plays with the genre's overused staples and its sophisticated audience's expectations."
1,Has enough kinky Grand Guignol moments and scenes of sheer terror to make a quick killing at the box office-even though it borrows from just about every other Bad Seed flick Hollywood has ever unleashed.
1,"It's a cut above most spooky-kid movies, with a twist that sets it apart."
0,Orphan contains one of the most terrifying and intense horror endings I have seen in years but the rest of the film was just laughably bad.
1,"While laughter may not be the intended entertainment value, you have to admit Orphan does entertain. Isn't that what really counts?"
1,Orphan is one of the weirdest major studio summer movies in a long time. It's the kid at the summer movie school that no one wants to play with because he's more than a little odd. I always liked kids like that.
0,Parental Content Review
1,"This is a poorly directed wannabe horror film that nevertheless contains more laughs than The Proposal, The Ugly Truth, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and Land of the Lost combined. Is that a compliment? Kind of."
0,"Actors have to eat like the rest of us, but you still have to wonder how Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ended up wading through Orphan and not laughing."
0,"It would be nice to think that Orphan brought something new to the genre, but the only thing it adds is more running time."
1,"So sloppy, so lowdown, so shameless and so entertaining, Orphan provides everything you might expect in a psycho-child thriller, but with such excess and exuberance that it still has the power to surprise."
0,"[Orphan] never exploits the dramatic possibilities, despite the efforts of its excellent cast and gorgeous production values."
0,"To really get under your skin, a bad-seed horror movie needs a demon child whose dastardliness sneaks up on you. There's nothing too subtle, however, about Esther."
0,"It just never quite comes together, either as a horror movie or as a goofy campfest."
0,"This is galling, distasteful trash. I hope the children involved in making it are never permitted to watch it."
0,The acting is richer than the story ... but this is a film designed to live or die on its twist. Good luck with that.
0,
1,That's quite a creepy premise for a horror story to live up to. That it does -- and more -- is a testament to the level of intensity in this tale of a troubled couple who adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl.
0,I'm almost offended that I'm not offended.

0,"This Orphan is an atmospheric and occasionally vicious little git and an above-average entry into the ""cuddly hellspawn"" genre, overlong at two-+ hours but nowhere near as excruciatingly overdone as others of its ilk."
1,Scared me. The twist works.
0,A decent horror flick with a great kid villain that is undone when it hits familiar chase movie territory and dead isn't really dead dead end.
1,The inclusion of a twist ending that's flat-out jaw-dropping in its audaciousness virtually justifies the entire movie's existence by itself...
0,It's ... uh ... creepy in that other way.
1,uncomfortable and wrong
0,It's based on the scene that plays out every day in the checkout line at Walmart.
1,"The most committed, downright unpleasant child-from-hell movie imaginable. It makes The Good Son play like Pollyanna."
0,An idiotic anti-adoption movie that skates over thin ice in its silly but vicious story.
0,Don't be afraid. Horror movies about creepy kids can be frightening %u2013 just not in Orphan.
1,"Its many outright depictions of children in jeopardy are scary, but its marital drama is even more unsettling."
1,"It's bloody, you should be warned, but in the end it is worth it."
0,Painfully predictable.
1,"An entertaining addition to the evil child genre, simply for its over-the-top chills and nutty plot"
0,filled with over the top gore and unnecessary plot twists better off left unseen. Leave this one at the orphanage.
0,I'll give this much credit to the movie: I absolutely did not see the twist coming. This is because the twist... is unconscionably f-----g stupid
1,"Not too much gore, and just the right amount of terror make this a mind twisting horror movie in the tradition of ""Carrie"" and ""The Omen."""
0,Schlocky but scary with a weird plot twist that may leave you stunned.
0,"Competently directed junk, with a script that abandons logic at every turn and dialogue that even some snarky teenage girls seated behind me could predict out loud."
0,It would be harder to find a more dark and joyless thriller on the market than this one.
0,"As the poster says, 'There's something wrong with Esther.' There certainly is -- she's trapped in this terminally dull and dimwitted movie."
1,I really enjoyed Orphan and enjoyed the fact that the film went to some pretty dark and twisted places.
1,"Balancing well-rendered melodrama with some impressively ballsy genre moves, Orphan is more enjoyable trash than it should be. Call it John and Kate Plus Hate."
1,Distinguished by a loony plot twist and by its sympathetic treatment of characters...
0,"Orphan delivers the goods and then some, but it's the pretense of respectability that overshadows its often silly, superficial but satisfying scares."
1,"I think that, if someone really wanted to adopt (as my dear parents did), it would take more than a single movie to dissuade them."
1,"An exceptional cast, including child actress Isabelle Fuhrman, make Orphan a cut above."
0,"... an angry, bitter and abhorrent display of masochism masquerading around as a legitimate horror film."
0,"It's not a bad idea for a horror movie, that the seeming victims are not innocent and their complicated past weighs on their present."
0,Check the return policy for this Orphan.
0,"Predictable and been-there, seen-that, but entertaining nevertheless at times."
1,"This wickedly entertaining, if slightly over-stretched, variation on the familiar 'evil child' scenario displays an unusually complex grasp of twisted psychology."
1,A creepy premise is undermined by wilfully flashy direction as a fine cast struggle bravely to inject credibility into a tale of vanishing nuns and burning treehouses.
1,"If you're not easily offended or upset, there is much to enjoy in Orphan. Horror films this skilfully made don't come along that often. You probably won't find a better one this year."
1,"Some impressively committed work from Farmiga (even when Googling ""Children who kill"") and a humdinger of a twist make this a rather good bad seed."
1,"Directing with a wink and some style, Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) knows that it's possible to be totally absurd and witty with it -- he has that trash touch."
1,"It's not only the heavily-signposted ""secret"" that's obvious, but every single scene, as square pegs fit joylessly into square holes for the full running time."
1,"Preposterous in all the right ways, Orphan is this week's true guilty pleasure."
1,"Collet-Serra manages to sustain tension throughout, prudently deploying his jumps and jolts and pumping up the grue factor. So while it often prompts hoots of derision, they're often choked off with a vice-tight wince."
1,"There's a lot of slow burn to endure in the first hour, but the payoff is one of the most batshit crazy finales in recent memory."
1,"Okay, so I saw the ending coming a mile off (and no, I'm not going to spoil it for everyone by telling you what happens) but that didn't stop me actually enjoying this guilty pleasure."
1,"Orphan is nasty but enjoyable, and the whole film is so competently crafted and superbly acted, especially by the three central females, that I was gripped and entertained throughout."
1,Orphan is certainly scary enough for the story to haunt you after the film is over.
1,"That director Jaume Collet-Serra made House of Wax, the Paris Hilton remake, does not bode well. But stars Vera Farmiga and Peter Saarsgard, as mum and dad, find a few frail pegs of humanity to hang their characters on."
0,"A squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip."
0,"After a slow-burning start Orphan degenerates into an increasingly grisly, far-fetched affair with a jaw-dropping twist that has you chortling with disbelief."
1,"Scoff-inducing twist aside, this is an uncannily astute and unnerving family psychodrama, over-garnished by final-act splatter."
1,"A welcome addition to the Evil Child sub-genre, thanks to great performances, strong direction, a delightfully over-the-top plot, some impressive gore effects and a terrific twist."
1,"If Esther materialises silently and unexpectedly once at the edge of the camera, she does it a dozen times - but this is merely the film warming up its trash aesthetic before heading onwards to a memorably queasy finale."
1,"Daring and fresh, 'Orphan' is easily one of the best horror movies of 2009."
0,"There's something wrong with Esther says the marketing tagline to this film, which sums up my response to the film itself."
1,"Nicely down horror flick with a great twist near the end. This is one EVIL child. Well-directed, too."
1,"Preventing Orphan from surpassing its ""solid"" status is the predictability of much of its plot. You'll be able to guess Esther's next move well before she makes it, and some of her sinister shenanigans suffer from being too outlandish."
1,Much credit goes to director Jaume Collet-Serra who shows off his skills to much better affect than in his... ridiculous 2005 remake of House Of Wax.
1,"Although slightly overlong, the film sustains the escalating horror and keeps up its sleeve a truly shocking revelation that's carefully prepared for, though not signalled."
1,Lifted above the average by a pretty nifty twist and some unnecessarily good acting.
0,"Sticking closely to the conventions of the Evil Child movie genre, there are few surprises (or even scares) as we saunter towards that absurd ending. Just about worth a punt on DVD."
1,"It has atmosphere and tension, and the performances are far better than usual for this sort of caper."
1,"One of the good things about ORPHAN, which is directed by Jaume Collet-Sera, is that it takes itself quite seriously and manages to bring a surprising level of originality to the potentially familiar material."
1,"Enough jump-out-of-your-seat moments to make this nonetheless trashy, implausible thirller watchable."
1,"Audacious, silly fun."
1,"Strange and nasty Esther is the consummate political player in a deadly game of unhappy families, in this fairly straightforward psychological thriller."
0,"Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther does her best with the material, but frankly the story lacks a strong central thesis about the nature of evil."
1,A pretty good little B-movie thriller.
0,"The movie amps up the tension to a laughable degree, using every clich in the horror movie guidebook."
0,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) endows this ugly mess with a slew of unintentional laughs, but not enough to repay the 123-minute time suck."
1,"Collet-Serra's film succeeds in being genuinely creepy, is commendably well acted by all concerned, and contains the best twist since The Crying Game."
1,"""A superior entertainment."""
1,a carefully staged deconstruction of our assumptions about horrorshows about preternaturally manipulative and malevolent children
1,"Orphan is as much a high-tension, frightening thriller as it is a straight-up horror flick, at least it is until it devolves into outright silliness in the final act."
0,Something isn't quite working in the intended way when the audience's primary reaction for two-+ (!) hours is raucous laughter.
0,A difficult child that horror-loving parents will find hard to adopt as one of their own.
1,"David Johnson's script plays fair with red herrings before a devilish denouement with all the torque of a good twist. Esther doesn't just want to topple the Colemans' house of cards. She wants to torch it, and ""Orphan"" is gruesome, gripping material."
0,...more concerned with producing cheap thrills and melodramatic effects than creating any sense of mystery or suspense.
1,"For the most part, Esther is an entertaining and solid addition to the Evil Child canon."
1,This is the rare fright flick that is actually grounded in some genuine human emotion.
0,"Orphan is not very good. At 90 minutes, it might have been amazing. At nearly two hours, it's tedious."
0,Bad Seed-style horror movie is gory and ludicrous.
0,"Alas, in the end, it's not nasty enough."
1,"As interesting as Collet-Serra's story is, there's simply nothing here that you won't find in other better evil children films in the library..."
0,Decidedly amoral.
1,"The movie is, as these things go, enjoyably trashy."
1,"If we could all stop for a moment and think about how excellent and uplifting garbage can be, America would rally around this movie like the treasure it is."
1,"Weak adult characters and lame ending aside, Orphan succeeds more often than not, mainly thanks to Fuhrman's performance and Collet-Serra's direction. It's not a fantastic thriller but it's not bad and often far better than it probably should be."
1,"If you are a huge fan of the evil kid sub-genre of horror flicks, then this movie is definitely going to be right up your alley."
1,
0,Dump a murderous psycho brat with a corny Russian accent into that troubled mix and you've got a real horror show on your hands. But not a good one.
1,Directed crisply and with a palpable air of mid-'70s paranoia thriller.
0,It does squander a strong setup though with an increasing amount of camp.
0,"The movie looks and sounds pretty, but that's not enough to warrant giving it a shot."
1,"A creepy, yet fun, alternative to a testosterone-filled summer, a small but effective little thriller that features some strong performances and a neat little twist that makes it a cut above most horror films."
1,Orphan is refreshing for its skilled execution and genuinely disturbing atmosphere that permeates every scene.
1,"Aryana Engineer, a real-life deaf actress, is almost equally as hypnotic as Fuhrman without uttering a single word throughout the film."
1,"If you're going to make a weepy, there's no reason you can't make it with intelligence and insight as the makers of My Sister's Keeper have done."
1,An awkwardly structured but warmly emotional and relatively unsentimental drama.
1,"Unsubtle, uneven and undeniably effective."
0,"Cameron Diaz gives a strong dramatic performance in Cassavetes family melodrama, which begins well with poignant probing of timely issues like social engineering before turning into conventional courtroom tale that deviates from the book considerably."
1,"My Sister's Keeper is a shameless weepy, one of the most manipulative and fundamental of genres, but it also raises some surprisingly difficult and thought-provoking ethical questions."
1,"A lot of things don't work that well in My Sister's Keeper, a tearjerker adapted from Jodi Picoult's best-seller. But one thing is guaranteed: The movie practically forces you to shed a tear or two."
0,Like a Lifetime disease-of-the-week movie on steroids...tugs at your heartstrings so relentlessly that by the time it's over you might require a defibrillator.
1,Films that present a moral dilemma and make us consider the unthinkable are as rare as bargain popcorn in the summer. Cassavetes manages that feat and turns this weeper into a keeper.
1,The writing team of Jeremy Leven and director Cassavetes have joined forces with a great cast to bring the best-selling book by Jodi Picoult to life with a purity that can only be called inspirational.
1,"While this little wrencher works, cinematically, perfectly well, the truth is, this one is going to piss off a whole lot of people."
0,Makeup department realism alone can't redeem the dramatic fallacies surrounding it.
0,"Once the bizarre premise is established, all the movie can do is wait for the story to play out -- it has a beginning and end, but no middle."
0,Two straight hours of emotional torture porn that is so brutally assaultive in its determination to jerk tears from viewers that it practically leaps off the screen and into their laps in order to get to them quicker.
0,No quote available.
1,"A motion picture of notable sensitivity and beauty, hamstrung emotions kept to a minimum. Tough, touchy, provocative, and exceptionally moving."
1,How far would you go to save your child's life? How far should you go? Those are the questions posed and largely ducked in this film based on the book by Jodi Picolt.
0,"A moving story, but the film's overly romantic tone rings hollow."
0,Don't avoid My Sister's Keeper because it's a film about a serious issue. Avoid it because it approaches that issue like a very special episode of Grey's Anatomy -- complete with whining pop songs and all the comforts of cliche.
0,A shameless attempt at manipulation that wants but doesn't earn audience tears.
1,"Keeper, striving to manipulate the audience, goes on a little longer than it should. However, the performances are so true that it's easy to forgive such unneeded, straight-to-the-heartstrings tactics."
0,"You may cry at the film's designated crying times, approximately every 10 minutes, like the traffic and weather. Or you may not, and wonder instead why some high-gloss weepies treat their source material quite so shamelessly."
0,"Less an exercise in catharsis than an obstacle course of premise-heavy, flashback-drenched plot points, it's an emotional flat-liner, even though virtually every character (including Alec Baldwin as the lawyer) carries some hurt or grief."
0,"It's beautifully shot and skillfully acted, but My Sister's Keeper, an earnest family-faces-cancer drama, is a bit like a real-world horror film with 'heart,' right down to the trick ending."
0,This ethical drama tries to make people think about medical and family dilemmas while wringing a few tears out of them along the way.
0,A perfect example of a disease-of-the-week movie done wrong.
0,"This book hasn't been adapted, it's been taken outside and shot."
0,"Wailing and screaming and fighting with everyone else onscreen, Cameron Diaz is giving a powerhouse performance her character doesn't warrant."
0,"...a blatant 10 hanky weeper masquerading as something deeper, but it does some things well in spite of itself."
0,My Sister's Keeper suffers from sheer sloppiness of script that results in scenes of comedic frivolity coming off as screechingly forced.
0,"It would take a heart of stone not to be affected by My Sister's Keeper, but the film's unceasing manipulation has a Medusa effect on the organ."
1,"My Sister's Keeper doesn't pull any punches, and it doesn't tell any lies, and it earns every feeling and thought and memory it brings to the audience."
0,"an overly sentimental movie-of-the-week, masquerading as counterprogramming to Michael Bay's box-office-blasting robots."
1,"Unsubtleties be damned, our defenses fall. Meanwhile, Cassavetes' reign as the go-to waterworks man remains uncontested."
0,"It's a family melodrama that never misses the opportunity for a heartbreaking, acoustic musical montage that brims with portent, as if we could forget that losing a child is hard and terrible."
0,"Surrounding and ultimately subsuming this ethical struggle is a fair amount of pediatric-cancer horror and mush, though Cassavetes is frequently bailed out by his cast."
0,"Like an amalgam of every ""ABC After-School Special"" ever made ... makes most Lifetime Channel movies seem competent by comparison."
1,My Sister's Keeper is an immediate audience-grabber.
0,"For every instant of genuine tragic ache within this dubious feature, there are two served up right behind it that drip with obnoxious manipulation and creaky execution."
0,A shamelessly manipulative film that proves insulting rather than moving.
0,"Ttries so hard to check in with everybody (dad, brother, sister, mom, etc.) that it doesn't get close enough to anyone."
1,Could easily have had the disease-of-the-week feel of a TV movie. But Cassavetes isn't afraid to tackle stories in which feelings trump ideas.
0,The infuriating cop-out ending reduces the premise to mush.
0,"A mostly contrived and uneven drama that lacks nuances and fails to pack an emotional punch, but at least it's mildly engaging thanks to warm, heartfelt performances and exquisite cinematography."
0,"Two hours later I felt as if I was heartless, as all this film did was make me wish I had the last two hours back even after all the melodramatic pain and suffering."
1,"Contrived or not, sad is sad, and My Sister's Keeper will have all but the most cement-hearted reaching for tissue."
1,"Given how easily the filmmakers could have cranked up the string section and gone for the quivering lip in soft focus, their restraint is admirable."
1,"Sad drama has heavy themes about and illness, family."
0,"Call me crazy or overly conservative, but I find it completely reprehensible to have another child simply to use as an organ and tissue farm for another kid."
1,A mawkish yet worthy enough addition to the summer line-up.
0,"My Sister's Keeper targets tear ducts so ruthlessly, it might as well be sponsored by Kleenex."
1,A film that overcomes an obscenely melodramatic setup to come by its tears honorably.
0,"True, it's as contrived as the genre gets, but it nevertheless left me mourning the movie that might have been."
1,"A surprisingly lovely movie about an absolutely awful subject, My Sister's Keeper features what also may be the year's first performance worthy of Oscar mention."
0,"Undeniably manipulative, not only in its plot, but in its dramatization of it."
1,"It's very emotional and often touching, but it's also got chemo, bone marrow extractions and a nihilistic view of death."
1,"The weepfest movie of the summer, but it has more going for it than that."
0,"My Sister's Keeper takes on a very tough subject, but ultimately it is too soft, too easy, and it dissolves like a tear-soaked tissue."
1,My Sister's Keeper humanizes vexing questions about medical ethics without sacrificing rattling family drama.
1,"Although the compelling courtroom drama gets forgotten for much of the movie, My Sister's Keeper also is relatively realistic about the physical and emotional toll of disease."
1,My Sister's Keeper is a rare tearjerker where the viewer doesn't feel jerked around (most of the time).
1,"Director Nick Cassavetes relies too much on montages with wispy songs about yearning and unicorns, but he gracefully balances the film's multiple viewpoints, which help us understand that the film's issues are not black and white."
1,"My Sister's Keeper isn't quite a keeper, but it's a sturdy melodrama that earns those copious tears."
1,"With solid performances and an intelligent script, My Sister's Keeper offers a moving and powerfully realistic portrait of a family stalked by tragedy that somehow manages to emerge from crisis battered but intact."
1,"For all its awkward structure, the film is heartfelt and deeply affecting."
0,My Sister's Keeper takes a compelling ethical dilemma and turns it into formulaic pap by trying relentlessly to ensure an emotional reaction with sentimental exploitation and plot contrivances.
0,"Faced with a clear choice between an entirely original story and one told a thousand times before, director and co-writer Nick Cassavetes takes the easy, well trodden path."
1,"An adaptation that, although departing dramatically from such key elements as the book's ending, will please fans."
1,"An outrageous Lifetime Television courthouse drama, constructed in the artful style of a Sundance drama..."
0,"[L]ike that last rush of endorphins they tell us floods our bodies to prepare us for death... [W]ants you to sob, but with bittersweet acceptance and saccharine grief, not with rage or anger or denial..."
1,"As an example of the age old Hollywood weeper as post-modern semi-serious character study, Nick Cassavete's My Sister's Keeper is too safe to be wholly successful, too powerful to be merely pushed aside."

1,Tears will be shed as the promised courtroom drama is displaced by other developments - Joan Cusack almost steals the pic as the lachrymose judge who has lost a young daughter herself.
1,"...consistently manages to rise above its similarly-themed, undeniably low-rent brethren..."

0,"It would be tough not to shed a tear for any child forced to look death in the face, but it's also a crying shame that such a delicate matter ends up being treated with an uncertain heavy hand."
0,"Full of clunky voiceovers, corny music and maudlin montages, this manipulative yarn plays with issues of medical morality and parental duty only to discard them in favour of a manipulative paean to valuing life and accepting death."
0,"With direction this leaden and scripting this ham-fisted, my suspicion is that there will be far too many dry eyes in the house."
1,"A very satisfying, if emotionally draining, experience. Needless to say you should take a large box of hankies - + a bottle of water so you can rehydrate afterwards."
0,"By the end we are screaming to yank our engines away from the forecourt as fuel spills - all that piano music, that gilded lighting, those glycerine tears - threatening a pyre of sense, sensibility and supersensitive subject choice."
0,This medical-ethics drama is like a sustained assault on the tear ducts.
0,"My Sister's Keeper ducks some of the bigger moral dilemmas, which may have added more grit. There again this is not a film with grit on its mind, just how quickly it can have you reaching for a handkerchief."
1,"My Sister's Keeper becomes a well-heeled weepie in which the family's comfortable existence, despite the misfortunes of fate, is hardly challenged at all."
0,This movie cheapens the experience of a family struggling to come to terms with the impending loss of a loved one. Cry? I very nearly did. Just not in the way Cameron probably hoped.
0,My Sister's Keeper might have earned its weepy moments if it had played fair with its central dilemma rather than putting forward a false choice.
1,"The performances are first-rate, with special commendation to Vassilieva in a breakout performance as a teen striving for normalcy in spite of her cancer."
0,"If the adults in My Sister's Keeper are repeatedly compromised in the honesty department, the children seem to embody truth physically."
1,"Sometimes, a sad story isn't just a manipulative venture that makes you cry. Sometimes, as in 'The Notebook,' it's a tale well told that brings out honest emotions. Sometimes, it's in a movie such as 'My Sister's Keeper.'"
1,"Navigates a minefield of emotional explosives intelligently and sensitively, with excellent performances that strike the right balance between heartfelt and hand-wringing."
0,The obnoxious calculation smothers what should've been a pure articulation of melancholy and a potent debate of morality.
1,"There's no question that this is a really intriguing drama and a drama that I think deserved better treatment than it gets here because I think Nick Cassevetes -- I don't think he's a very good director, really."
1,There is a touch of contrivance to the set-up that is not totally convincing and the film avoids much of the ethical arguments in favour of family drama. But I must admit to being affected.
1,A morally ambiguous tearjerker with a twist.
0,"Though the motives of My Sister's Keeper will seem dubious to some, there is no denying the performances on display keep everything in the realm of the watchable."
1,"As manufactured Disease of the Week weepies go, Nick Cassavetes's drama based on a Jodi Picoult bestseller, is surprisingly moving."
1,"The decision to avoid unnecessary sentimentality defines this film, elevating it to a more thoughtful if a touch less engaging arena, sacrificing emotional escapism for conversation provoking tragedy."
0,"What starts as an exploration of the ethics of organ-donation and genetic selection, rapidly disintegrates into a sloppy, unstructured, tear-jerking mess."
1,"Cassavetes...shows great skill in weaving bright moments -- even an adolescent romance -- into the gloom. It's still bittersweet, but like mass-produced cr챔me caramel, never too bitter."
0,"[Cassavetes] refuses to let the material speak for itself, putting a famous-for-making-women-cry song behind almost every scene, and lingering on every sentimental moment."
1,Bring the tissues. This film works.
1,"[I]ntelligent, moving and even occasionally funny, although you might want to bring along a few tissues just in case."
0,"I tried to keep an open mind, hoping something would win me over. It didn't happen."
0,"The film has a profound and compelling premise. Regrettably, it seems intent on being about everything but that premise."
0,My Sister's Keeper demands nothing less than a tidal wave of tears.
1,The film has its flaws and swims in meticulously crafted schmaltz... yet also has well-conceived tender moments hiding in the fringes.
1,"Strong performances, and a subtle script make director Cassavetes film one of the better tearjerkers of the year..."
1,"Yes, unabashed weeper My Sister's Keeper has that Hollywood sheen -- but it's the unexpectedly piercing realness of this family's anguish that's going to get you. Just try to hold back the waterworks."
0,"My Sister's Keeper is a committee-approved nerve-snapper that, much like its main character, has been genetically engineered to MAKE! YOU! CRY!"
1,"Tearjerker that aims for rarefied feelings as well as knee-jerk, sentimental moments."
1,
0,"It is effective, but only in the most shallow, manipulative way, and results in a cowardly, movie-of-the-week exit that isn't worthy of these engaging sisters."
1,Fans of Picoult's novel are likely to be at least modestly disturbed by the liberties that Cassavetes takes.
1,I loved Fat Jesus. A comedy that's funny and naughty. This is a franchise. Mike Tyson has a career in movies!
1,"Head-poundingly (in a good way), sidesplittingly funny."
1,"Proudly inappropriate and buoyed by both a clever script and some obvious chemistry between the film's male leads, director Todd Phillips' comedy will play like gangbusters with men and may even attract some women who know and love knuckleheads."
1,The Hangover is surprisingly clever as well as R-rated rowdy.
1,"Miraculously, we still like Alan and Stu and Phil even as we crack up when they get tazed and beaten. Phillips has pulled off a feat of balance that rivals Cirque du Soleil down the Strip."
1,"This tried and true plot line not only works, but works hilariously."
1,"A comedy that stays weird and wild for the first two-thirds, only to disappoint in the final act."
1,"The male trio is so funny, the situations so wacky, the lingo so foul, and other characters and props so eccentric (absent groom, missing tooth, lost chickens, a tiger, Mike Tyson singing) that you gladly and joyously join the wild ride."
1,This surefire summer hit might even get Vegas back on a winning streak.
1,Very funny.
1,I think this is going to be a big comedy hit this summer.
1,"Director Phillips wrings his scenario for consistent semi-dark humor, letting his odd-couple leads go for broke and wielding mystery as a comedic spur that keeps the proceedings from dragging."
1,"...I think I can safely predict that ""The Hangover"" will join March's ""I Love You Man"" as one of the funniest films of the year."
1,Todd Phillips masterfully shows that the combination of unexpected ingredients can create a potent chemistry that elevates a simple premise.
1,"To its credit, ""The Hangover"" transfers to the audience the smelly, still inebriated state that the title promises."
1,"The Hangover, Todd Phillips' return to fratastic form after the disappointing School for Scoundrels, marks itself as an aesthetic step up for the Old School director right from the get go."
1,Ninety minutes of pure perverse laughter
0,"Coarse but only intermittently amusing example of boys' night out...Among guy flicks this one comes in around the middle, neither unmentionably terrible nor particularly memorable."
0,"If you've seen the trailer for The Hangover, then you've pretty much seen all the funny parts. You've probably also unspooled a movie in your head that's way more fun than what's actually screening in theaters."
1,... Just might be the funniest movie of the decade.
0,You'll laugh three or four times and probably won't remember why.
1,"The Hangover has scattered laughs (many in the cathartically funny end-credit montage), but overall it's more amusing than hilarious."
1,It's so funny it might convince you that sometimes the raunchy journey is worth the laugh-out-loud reward.
0,"It's hilarious in spurts and several bit players score, but the movie doesn't have enough momentum to carry it through the dead spots."
1,An unusually palatable entry in a rancid genre.
1,"While I'm not saying you have to be hungover to appreciate The Hangover, having a wild night out before seeing this the next day might enhance this hilarious experience."
1,"An energetic jaunt through ribald territory, centered on the theory that some guys just can't handle Vegas."
1,"The Hangover's nutty, naughty fun that never takes itself the least bit seriously."
0,A film so completely stupid and hateful that you get the sense that it was financed by the Atlantic City tourism board as a way of besmirching the good name of their chief competition.
1,"Who would have thought? The Hangover is a crude, crass comedy that manages to be smart at the same time - oh, and funny as hell."
1,"A cheerfully outrageous comedy, with much of the humor coming from discovering with them just how appallingly they have violated every standard of appropriate behavior."
0,"A geek bonding guy movie just as easily titled, I Love You, Men, this in-your-face grossout about grown males in pursuit of living out their wannabe vice junkie daydreams badly, detours into beyond crude humor more often sour than sweet."
1,"The Hangover remains unrepentantly irresponsible and hilarious throughout, culminating with what could be the funniest montage ever to grace a picture's end credits. The summer's first sleeper hit has arrived."
1,"It has a couple of stand-out characters in Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, and enough T-shirt-worthy catchphrases to keep the chuckles coming."
1,"As goofy and strange as the situations become, we wouldn't have any investment in this sometimes distasteful silliness if we didn't like these guys."
1,"The Hangover is a breathless stroke of comedic genius; one of those movies where, when it comes out on DVD and you have a bunch of friends over, you won't be able to watch just one scene."
1,"The latest in the wave of post-Judd Apatow Bad Lad comedies, The Hangover is rowdy, scurrilous, and, for about three-quarters of its running time, a lot more hilarious than it has any right to be."
0,It's a film about forgetting that seems designed to be forgotten.
1,easily one of the funniest films of the year.
1,"Big laughs, tigers, Heather Graham breast-feeding, naked Asian man beating the boys with a tire iron, Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins%u2026 I'm trying, but I'm not finding much to dislike here."
1,"Director Todd Phillips ups the ante on his ""Old School"" antics in ""The Hangover,"" a movie which solidifies the comic chops of Cooper and Helms and should make a star out of Galifianakis."
1,"A fantastic blend of raunch and more cerebral, off-the-wall humor, this isn't a case of reinventing the wheel but shaping it so that it rolls pure."
1,"Though the film falters toward the end, The Hangover is a side-splitting adventure you'll still be laughing about the morning after."
1,Exactly the shot of drinking-age-and-up comedy the summer needs before the soda-pop PG-13 sticky-sweetness of summer blockbuster season hits.
1,"The payoff to the mysteries isn't nearly as interesting as the setup, and the ending of the movie is disappointingly squishy. But while it's riding a hot streak, The Hangover is a rush."
1,"If The Hangover sounds like a hybrid of Bachelor Party and Dude, Where's My Car, its kind of is. It has its share of both laugh-out-loud and WTF moments, but also contains scenes that deflate the comic momentum."
1,"I'm going to say, at the risk of doing time in the blurbitentiary, that The Hangover is the Citizen Kane of bachelor party movies."
0,"As if it wasn't bad enough to be stuck in Las Vegas with these middle-aged misanthropes, The Hangover does the inconceivable disservice of robbing the audience of that elusive sweet spot of GCA usefulness: the drunken escapade."
1,The Hangover instantly has the feel of one for the ages.
1,"Now this is what I'm talkin' about. The Hangover is a funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny"
1,Easily one of the funniest films so far this year.
1,"Restores faith in Phillips and the vulgar passions of the R-rated comedy, assembling a smutty epic of irresponsibility that handles with a certain amount of routine, but still delivers huge on laughs and knowing cringes."
1,"As forgettable as a night of hard drinking, this frat-level comedy is good for a few laughs but never quite gels."
0,"[T]hinks it's edgy and envelope-pushing, but there's nothing terribly risque or dangerous about it... [H]int[s] at possibilities far more dangerous than it ever dares go near..."
0,"The rush of craziness like stealing cop cars and marrying strippers comes from the actual act of doing it--uh, so I've heard--not just being told about it the next day."
1,No deep thoughts here -- just the kind of raucously vulgar entertainment that every summer needs. Indulge yourself without guilt.
1,"Cooper, Helms and especially Galifianakis find the right tone to give Phillips' Vegas dream world a funny, slightly dangerous appeal."
0,"Unless you find the man-infant Galifianakis appealing, you%u2019ll surely spend The Hangover wistfully remembering the days when Will Ferrell made good movies and Luke Wilson was still relevant."
1,The guilty pleasure comedy hit of the summer has arrived. This could be the breakout role for Galifianakis.
0,"This represents the worst sort of pandering slop, the type that appeases impressionable audiences who don't even realize they're being insulted."
1,"While I'm not ready to call the film a triumph, its approach to humor is smart enough to benefit greatly from low expectations. Which is to say, it's an enjoyable piece of trash."
1,"It's just funny - pretty much from start to finish, or at least whenever Zach Galifianakis' 'Fat Jesus' is on screen."
1,"The script is really a marvel of invention as it finds myriad ways to sink the characters deeper and deeper into the abyss, and this is where many of the film's biggest laughs come into play."
1,"Helms, Cooper and Galafianakis are a great comedy trio with each one bringing a different element to the movie."
1,Who knew a Hangover could be so much fun?
1,"The Hangover knows its place and plays right to it. If you see this movie, you'll probably be offended and definitely be disturbed, but you'll also laugh quite a bit."
0,It's hard to think of any truly memorable moments from this creatively challenged outing.
1,It's the funniest movie of the year.
1,"By the end of the film, these guys are our pals."
0,"The movie smells like a hit, but honestly: Helms excepted, did it need to be quite so blandly cast, or quite so lamely raunchy?"
1,It's a dizzying array of bawdy set pieces buoyed by a eclectic cast.
1,It's a non-stop laugh riot that's destined to become a comedy classic.
1,There is a sort of perverse brilliance or brilliant perverseness to be found in this story of a bachelor party gone terribly wrong.
0,"The Hangover, like the condition for which it's named, has some spirited moments, but more often it stumbles and slurs, regurgitating earlier pleasures and praying for the fog to lift."
0,"Amusing as it is, it never feels real."
1,Memento meets Old School? It's party time.
1,"If there is any justice in the universe, The Hangover will make Zach Galifianakis a household name."
1,"Every summer needs at least one silly, dirty comedy, but The Hangover may end up being one of the few to actually get the mix right."
1,"Much smarter than it needs to be and darker than you'd expect, The Hangover seems destined to be the big comedy of the summer."
1,Surprisingly funny and smartly acted.
1,You will not be ennobled. But you will be entertained.
1,It distinguishes itself from other what-happens-in-Vegas comedies (practically a subgenre at this point) by setting an especially vivid scene and telling an actual story instead of pasting together random shenanigans the way many modern comedies do.
1,"Superbly cast, well-written and so silly it makes your teeth ache."
1,The Hangover is a cut above the typical contemporary guy-friendship comedy.
0,"Early in this unraveling adventure, a Vegas tourist quips, ""Some guys just can't handle Vegas."" Yeah, we know a couple: writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore."
1,You're likely to hear all about it as friends and co-workers endlessly quote lines or re-create scenes.
0,"Surrender your soul to its foul mesh of cheap cleverness and vulgarity. and you howl like a delighted demon. Resist, and you feel all sense and sensibility being crushed in its cogs."
1,The funniest movie so far this year.
1,"Waking up with a hangover and no memory of what happened the night before is an experience most people can relate to, but it's also a surefire device for comedy."
1,"The Hangover should be a huge hit this summer for laugh-starved audiences; happily, it delivers."
0,"This kind of 'one crazy night' tale relies on drum-tight structure to work. Without it, The Hangover sputters to a sentimental halt."
0,This is a bromance so primitive it's practically Bro-Magnon.
1,"Keep your expectations low, and you'll be amused."
1,"A strong cast, a quirky script with some unexpected twists and a steady hand from the director's chair make this a desert ride on the wild side a worthy road trip."
1,"Even though Apatow has no fingerprints over this movie, The Hangover follows in the same surprise-me tradition: It takes us to the dumb side but comes back with something unexpectedly affecting."
0,"It is a situation comedy dressed in narrative clothing, and the story it tells is less amusing than the high-concept premise."
0,Parental Content Review
0,With The Hangover Todd Phillips has officially become the Uwe Boll of comedy.
0,"A glib, drab, fatally unfunny study in mean-spirited mediocrity. Goes down about as easily as Benadryl spiked with tequila."
1,"Raunchy and ruthlessly naughty, it's all buzz, no headache."
1,"If I had enough money, I would be willing to pay anyone back if they saw this movie and did not like it."
0,"Would I have liked this film better if I went in cold, having never seen the trailer? Perhaps, but I'll never know."
1,"Phillips, with a script credited to Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (and with loads of loose-limbed interpretations from the cast), captures the amity among a group of grown men set loose without spouses, girlfriends, or sobriety to hinder them. (Or help.)"
1,"The Hangover is sure to make moviegoers laugh so hard that their heads will hurt (in a good way, of course)."
1,"The Hangover ain't art, but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams."
0,"Outrageousness proves hard to sustain, and after a stomach-lurchingly quick start, The Hangover slows down and, by the third act, fizzes out like Alka-Seltzer in a highball glass."
1,What hangover? This movie is safe as milk.
1,"Comedies this good don't happen by accident, even if a little organization could have made The Hangover much better than what it is."
1,"A stripper, a stolen police car, a tazer gun demonstration, illegal drugs, a used condom, a naked Asian gambler, a bawling baby, a bemused chicken and a tiger are part of this outrageously rowdy and funny comedy that is anything but a headache"
1,"As gleefully dirty as Old School, and maybe funnier."
1,"It's a ridiculously funny movie, yes-- but it's also a skillful picture, blessed with an ingeniously constructed narrative that keeps the viewer involved while taking full advantage of its gifted cast and their specific comedic mojo."
1,A great buddy flick that could be the surprise hit of the summer.
1,The film also develops in a way that although over-the-top feels grounded in a recognisable reality.
1,"Unlike most so-called ""comedies,"" this one can claim the virtue of being reasonably funny."
1,The juxtaposition of the characters is ingenious. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
1,"Unlike last years rather uninspiring What Happens in Vegas, the hysterical The Hangover actually ends up doing Sin City proud."
1,"The jokes and sight gags are hit and miss, but the plot and characters are compelling and it has a lot of twists and turns that keep you guessing right up to the end."
1,"The plot climaxes in what could be the best credit roll outtakes in movie history. If not that, they certainly rank as one of the best-ever punch lines."
1,"""The Hangover"" pretty much demands you leave your Political Correctness Cap at home and urges you to eschew your Thinking Cap as well."
0,"When the years have passed and the buzz has worn off, I honestly feel that people will look back at The Hangover and wonder what they laughed at in 2009. It's the Zima of movie comedies."
0,...the movie suffers from a variety of problems that are ultimately exacerbated by Phillips' progressively desperate efforts at wringing laughs out of material that could hardly be more tedious.
0,The Polaroids of the bachelor party shown during the end titles deliver the genuine laughs the movie has promised; they're better than the entire movie that preceded it.
1,"Just as a marriage is built on love and promises kept, so can a bromance. ""The Hangover"" honors and cherishes that idea in slickness and stealth, and will have audiences unsure of how to say Zach Galifianakis but certain he's a star."
1,There's a better cast here than there deserves to be.
1,"Amusing but a bit overrated. Yes, it's a great comic premise but only partially fulfilled in a raucous summer comedy aimed squarely at the frat boy in all of us."
1,"A picture which periodically pushes the envelope further than the average moviegoer is probably capable of stomaching via ill-advised departures into such taboo subjects as child molestation, all in search of a cheap joke."
1,"Vulgar, obscene and offensive, The Hangover is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time and is surely destined to become a comedy classic."
1,"There is a lull toward the end, where you almost become as exhausted as the boys on the trip. But (and I rarely say this) thank goodness for those end credits."
1,"While its boisterous fun has strong libidinous overtones, it never takes the plunge into full, frothing raunch."
1,There are people who will not find this film amusing. Amish elders. Infants. An Iowan farmer named Burl. And that should cover it. The rest of you: bring a change of underwear.
1,"If there's a problem with 'The Hangover' (and other films of its ilk), it's the at best ambivalent, at worst hostile relationship to women..."
1,"the kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes."
0,There are some funny moments in the movie but there are some unfunny ones as well. It's an okay movie but it doesn't live up to the hype.
1,"Great casting benefits the movie hugely, as does a premise centered around the mystery of what happened, but its choppy editing does it no favors."
1,a cleverly vulgar comedy that manages to take a tired conceit and make it feel inventive and consistently funny
1,It gets the job done thanks in large part to the breakout performance given by Galifianakis.
1,"A fast-moving, constant joking, how funny is a guy pulling out his own tooth kind of movie."
1,Stands up as a motion picture in addition to working as a delivery system for gags... as fine a mystery and character study as it is a comedy.
0,"If a bachelor party bender is your thing, you've got company. I didn't say taste."
1,"What makes any film work, and this is particularly true of comedy, is making it real, even though everything we're seeing is completely unbelievable. I laughed a lot with this one."
1,"The performances are solid, with a special nod to the droll buffoonery of Zach Gilifianakis, whose character is out of it even when he is sober and alert."
0,Raunchy comedy about a bachelor party gone wrong.
0,"The revelations of the night before won't shock you (strippers, wedding chapel, drugs), but there's so much vomiting, car crashing and tasering of genitals that you don't have time to ponder how uninteresting the story really is."
1,"Hilarious from go-to-whoa and visually compelling in its rarely seen Vegas-by-day aesthetic, The Hangover is the very definition of raucous entertainment, and will undoubtedly rate as one of the comedies of the year."
1,Hangover shows no mercy in its quest for laughs.
1,The Hangover is nothing special. It's a fair-to-middling bombardment of humor thrown against the wailing walls of Las Vegas. It misses as much as it hits.
1,"The best bachelor party movie since, well, ""Bachelor Party"""
1,"You might be embarrassed by laughing at some of the silliness, but don't be: Everyone else will be cracking up, too."
0,To call it 'atrocious' and 'loathsome' is to pussyfoot around the truth.
1,"Pushing the envelope unlike anything the industry has offered us this year; ""The Hangover"" provides the escape factor. Prepare for the wild ride!"
1,"The cast is personable, the photography is attractive, the script is cleverly constructed and mildly amusing but there is nothing here that screams comedy classic."
0,"It doesn't help that the central cast is almost entirely forgettable, from the smug lounge lizardry of Bradley Cooper to the boisterous Jack Black-lite of Zach Galifianakis."
0,"An intriguing, time-hopping set-up is wasted on obnoxious characters, celebrity cameos and crass attempts at humour."
1,"Consistently funny, The Hangover proves you don't need a big-name Hollywood cast to get big laughs. Destined to appeal to the lads everywhere, that the film doesn't only resort to gross-out gags means female audiences should give it a go."
0,The lads duly lurch from one bewildering crisis to another.
1,"It turns out to be every bit as crass, offensive and incorrect as you'd expect, but it's also - gulp! - really very funny an awful lot of the time, as well as bizarrely gripping."
1,"Everything works here; the characters are funny, the set-ups are funny, the lines are funny."
1,The Hangover amounts to a gut-bustingly funny boy's own comedy.
1,"Debauched, depraved and very, very funny."
1,The cracking script - a veritable treasure trove of smart one-liners - and beautifully-worked setpieces make this one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year.
1,"Succeeding equally well as rowdy romp, what-happened mystery and man-crush comedy, /The Hangover/ is an unexpected winner."
1,With a great soundtrack and script so sharp you might need to take plasters into the cinemas with you because you might come out with cuts... this is this summer's must see comedy.
1,"Rude, crude and defiantly male, it's the ultimate phallocentric antidote to Sex And The City, and easily the funniest American comedy of the year."
1,"Lewd, crude and exceptionally rude, the gags come thick and fast."
1,A devilishly smart comedy gem that manages to blend the raunchy and the rowdy with some deliciously left-field humour.
1,"The Hangover serves up a steady stream of big, dumb laughs, but you may feel a gnawing sense of guilt right afterwards."
1,
1,"A furiously paced, inventive and flat-out hilarious take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs, maintaining plenty of the former and a superabundance of the latter."
1,
1,"Rude, crude and downright distasteful - this film is brilliant."
1,"Laugh? Well, at least, on a tough Tuesday in Tube-meltdown London, one chuckled."
1,"Some very funny, very non-PC dialogue is thrown about like a game of catch. The actors, virtually unknown, are terrific."
1,A wee-inducingly funny bromance.
1,One of the funniest films we've seen in many a moon.
1,Easily the funniest film of the year. A must-see.
1,"Hugely enjoyable and frequently hilarious, this is a sharply written comedy with strong comic performances from a terrific ensemble cast."
1,"It's not very sophisticated, but this raucous comedy keeps us laughing with its sheer absurdity. The characters are very well-played and their interaction is genuinely hilarious, even if most of the jokes are pretty cheap."
1,"This is top stuff. There's all the carnage, baps and humiliation you could want from a 15-rated comedy but it's pegged around a smart plot that actually holds up. Take out the laughs, and The Hangover would still work as a gripping, if barmy thriller."
0,"The comedy is consistently funny and the cast? Well, they're hardly A-list, but therein lies the magic as they're all hugely likeable and pair that with a funny script and you get guaranteed entertainment."
1,It kicks this sub-genre up a gear with an anarchic sense of fun and a consistently high gags-to-giggle ratio that knows when to push the envelop of taste and when to pull back a little.
1,"It is sometimes coarse, and there are some scurrilous scenes. But this is an inventive, funny, entertaining movie."
1,"Now I'm not sure if urinating explicitly on screen is one giant step for mankind or not, but one should not be surprised that the comedy in which this has occurred has been directed by Todd Phillips."
1,"""The Hangover"" will induce headaches - from laughter."
1,If only real hangovers were this much fun.
1,"'The Hangover' is an outrageous, entertaining, laugh-out-loud classic from beginning to end."
1,"Who knew that we needed a 'Dude, Where's My Car?' for grownups?"
1,"The director and his screenwriters have come up with the funniest film to appear in ages. It avoids the predictable crudity and silly laddishness (well, almost) you'd expect, and delights with zinging one-liners and charming performances."
1,"The director, harnessing the talents of a relatively unknown cast, creates a genuine minor classic of the genre."
1,"This is an above par effort, excellently played and just naughty enough to be thought daring as well as amusingly spiteful."
0,Rising-star Bradley Cooper and gang represent the dirtbag element that has become acceptable in contemporary comedy.
1,"You could say his new film The Hangover is the Reservoir Dogs of party movies. Reservoir Dogs was a heist film that never shows you the heist, and The Hangover is about a wild night in Vegas that only shows the aftermath."
1,The Hangover is funny but not deeply so. There's a difference between funny incidents piled up in a line and people who make us laugh because of who they are.
0,"Comedies have rarely been as lazy as this, nor have they been so adamantly stupid."
1,Galifianakis is a revelation of wrong.
1,"My only complaint about The Hangover is that so many excellent moments were ruined by the preview. The Hangover, particularly Ed Helms, is very funny. Don't bring a family member and don't try any of this at home."
1,"Easily, one of summer's more outrageous, funny comedies."
1,"It is classless, it is tasteless, it is idiotic, it is juvenile and it is something your mother totally wouldn't approve of. But it also is flat-out hilarious."
1,A comedy binge-fest you won't regret in the morning.
1,"It is easily the most unlabored comedy of the recent past. But seriously, how many times has a story like this been told?"
0,You'd have to be drunk...
0,"The Hangover isn't painful to watch. If friends drag you to this movie, you won't hate them afterwards. But maybe it'll seem a lot funnier if you are drinking."
1,O mais surpreendente  o cuidado com que o roteiro desenvolve seus trs personagens principais.
0,Fear and loathing and douchebaggery in Las Vegas
1,"Leave the kids at home, round up a group of guys and head out to the theater for a good time."
1,"The raucous, raunchy laughs are indeed plentiful and the gags often outrageous, but what really drives the film is the unpredictability of the script."
0,The Hangover's witless regression is unforgivable.
1,"Question: What do Mike Tyson's tiger, a chicken, a horrible effeminate Chinese man stereotype naked in a car trunk, a stolen police car, a baby, a missing tooth and Phil Collins' music all have in common? Answer: Nothing..."
0,"...apparently, I have no sense of humor for finding so little joy in the runaway hit comedy 'The Hangover.'"
1,"works not because it is a comedy, but because its unimpressive comedic content is framed by much more interesting detective story"
0,"The real underlying message of The Hangover, as in most of Phillips' films, is that women are shrews, whores and/or fools-though Galifinakis is the only one to deal with the homoerotic subtext within the male bonding."
1,"Quite entertaining as an entry in this tried-and-true genre of ""guys going on a inadvertent wacky adventure,"" and I like how this one is set up as a kind of mystery."
1,"Todd Philips, who wrote and directed Road Trip and Old Scool, wrote Borat, and even plays the coked out Israeli dude in the elevator in The Hangover, has had his finger on the pulse of modern comedy cinema for a decade."
1,The stupid fun of The Hangover is worth experiencing at least once. [Blu-ray]
1,"Bachelor Party meets Dude, Where's My Car (and about as entertaining as the two of them averaged together.)"
1,The Hangover doesn't contain the constant rip-roaring laughs the likes of Superbad or some of the Frat Pack's best.
1,"The Hangover never pretends to be anything other than what it is, and, partially for that reason, it carries quite a kick."
1,"A fun time is had watching these three men piece together a night that never was, something of an old school detective story mixed with a heavy dose of adult humour. Better comedies have been released, yet not many as brazen as The Hangover."
0,"It's good for wasting time and pondering the absurdity of not-so-random events, but not for much else."
1,"I can definitely understand why it was a humongous hit, but when all is said and done, once was enough for this partier..."
1,
1,"The Hangover might not be top class indie pop art, but the film represents the best of what comedy can provide -- pure, unadulterated, slaphappy entertainment. And there's nothing wrong with that."
1,"I highly recommend going into this film blind, just to keep some of the surprises from being ruined. Oh, and being a 21-year-old male will also really help you to enjoy this flick."
0,"Starting on Monday, Coogan and Bryden share meals . . . and what passes for conversation. When they're not insufferable, they're boring"
1,
1,A younger generation is finding new stupid things to do underneath the desert sun.
1,"If the movie's gleeful rush into areas of questionable comedic taste occasionally raises an eyebrow here and there, the end sequence will sear them right off."
1,"Just when you think things can't get any more farcical, they do: The Hangover is the Crank of comedy."
1,"The kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes and rocking back in your chair from laughter."
1,"The galaxy Galifianakis is beaming in from is infinitely more fascinating than the one this film occupies, but his visits from Beserko World are more than worth it."
0,"This is lazy, condescending half-assed filmmaking. When in doubt, simply slap a piece of rap music overtop of the action."
1,... I went in to The Hangover with low expectations but ended up laughing more times than I thought I would.
1,"In the case of The Hangover, Phillips made a decent diversion, but no classic; like its heroes you'll have a good time, then forget most of it when you wake up the following morning. It's a movie, not a film."
0,"The movie, in the end, feels as as shabby as the unfulfilled lives that, we assume, these men will resume once the fun and games are over."
1,"Though it looks like just another men-will-be-guys-will-be-boys-will-be-idiots affair, this well-scripted affair still stands up as a refreshingly unpredictable laugh machine."
0,"Maybe, just maybe, the movie drags like a half-detached muffler and for some reason nobody wants to mention it."
1,Galifianakis went from being an alt-comedy idol to a mainstream pop culture figure. The Hangover still feels like a breath of fresh air.
1,Here's a comedy that understands how to be raunchy and smart -- and isn't afraid to get a laugh at any expense.
0,"The filmmakers throw in so many forced elements of farce, that it dissipates the sense that maybe, just maybe, this kind of thing could happen to any of us."
1,"What happens in Vegas is very funny, indeed."
0,"100 minutes of dopey behavior and filmmaking inanity wrapped up tight in a bland, gutless PG-13 wooby, taking a proven premise and watering it down to a parade of nonsense created only to tickle gullible teen audiences."
0,a shabby substitute for its original.
0,"if you can think past the thirty second mark, the house of cards that is the script dissolves faster than cotton candy in the rain"
0,"The original is notable for being a breakthrough role for Terry O'Quinn, nowadays best known as John Locke on Lost. The remake is notable for nothing whatsoever."
0,"A botched remake...A real thriller has you on the edge of your seat; watching this one, you're more liable to sit back and snooze."
0,"Dylan Walsh's demeanor is more compelling than the small handful of perfunctory kill scenes, all of which you'll see from six miles away."
0,"Poorly scripted and executed, this quickie slasher remake suffers from weak casting and doesn't even exploit the sexual politics involved in a major gender change from the 1987 feature, which satirized the rigid family values and has become a classic."
0,"The well-choreographed five-minute chase sequence offers more excitement than the rest of the movie combined. By then, it's far too late to forget the boredom suffered over the course of the rest of what's essentially a competent but dull and highly unnec"
0,[Nelson] McCormick has crafted a horror remake so undistinguished it makes Prom Night look like a masterpiece of transgressive filmmaking.
0,The Stepfather is studio-produced drivel that puts a negative label on horror movies and psychological chillers. The only pleasure to be had from watching it is to so easily be able to pick it apart.
0,"Comparing the original to this one is like comparing regular basketball to donkey basketball--a perfectly good thing has been needlessly ""improved"" by making everything bigger and dumber and by allowing a bunch of jackasses to dump all over it."
1,"The original was a no-frills, psychology-based affair that got most of its juice from the conflict between the dad and his suspicious stepdaughter, but the new one is needlessly complicated and more overt."
0,"This kind of film needs a ""R"" rating. Making it ""PG-13"" leaves even horror fans yawning. And, there's not enough drama or originality to keep anyone glued to this very poor remake. Just leaves you wanting the original. Paul Chambers, CNN."
0,"A little more guts - not necessarily more gory -- could have turned The Stepfather into a real re-imagining, not just a re-heating; what we get is just another trip down memory lane that runs out of gas."
0,"There are some movies that should not be re-made. This is one of them, as proven by this updated, cliche-filled version which fails to build up the necessary tension and truncates the mystery."
0,"Shallow and inert, ""The Stepfather"" goes through the motions of a suspense film without ever broaching the horror genre that director Joseph Ruben employed in the original. Talk about ""unclear on the concept,"" this remake doesn't even get the genre right."
0,"This perfunctory retread had a tame, made-for-TV feel, and not just because the humdrum cast is composed of network and cable B-listers."
0,This remake turns a fondly remembered horror/thriller into a mild and tedious suspense film.
0,"Even by horror-remake standards, The Stepfather sets the bar for pointlessness."
0,Better to honor history and rent the original.
0,"The trouble with the movie, apart from its rather monotonous dourness of tone, is that everyone in the family... comes off as tougher, smarter, and quicker on the draw than the stepfather who's supposed to be outfoxing them."
1,"The Stepfather is that rarity, an effective remake of a screen classic that can stand alone on its own considerable merits."
0,A clumsy remake of the 1987 cult thriller.
0,It's hard to get absorbed in a story with so many unresolved issues.
1,"I didn't think anyone could match Terry O'Quinn's riveting performance in the 1987 film, but Dylan Walsh nails the title role in this remake."
0,That last stormy night of violence should be the shocker. Giving away his ruthlessness in earlier killings robs the movie of it its payoff as it saps the climax of much of its power.
0,"Riddled with implausible situations, including many instances of Creepy Stepdad appearing suddenly in doorways and mirrors, and zero instances of genuine suspense or style."
0,Dylan Walsh shines in the title role but the film is only mildly entertaining
0,"Ooh, daddy! If you want some old-fashioned cheesy suspense, look no farther than 'The Stepfather.'"
1,"The Stepfather is, finally, only as good as its stepfather -- and Dylan Walsh ain't bad."
0,"If you call a film The Stepfather, then your title character -- in this case, David Harris (Dylan Walsh) -- should have the decency to marry into that perfect little family that he's predisposed to butcher and kill."
0,Wait till your father gets home... on DVD.
0,"As characters get startled but you don't and you suspenselessly wait for everyone to figure out what we realized long ago (Mr. Harris kills people, then 105 minutes of your life), you may well wonder about the bloody point of it all."
0,a shameless exercise in promoting the lowest common denominator
0,"What is there to be said about this utterly worthless, addle-brained waste of 101 minutes except that it's an utterly worthless, addle-brained waste of 101 minutes?"
0,"Substitutes an Oedipus complex for sexual menace by replacing the teenage daughter heroine of the earlier film with a hunky military school bad boy, then compounds the mistake with a bad pop/rock soundtrack and a silly action climax..."
0,Astonishingly dull and carefully scrubbed of all but the most sanitized violence in the name of securing a PG-13 rating.
0,...yet another toothless and entirely needless horror-movie remake.
0,"There's mayhem all over the place and not a policeman, or much logic, in sight. Watchable nonsense, with performances better than the story deserves."
0,Clich챕-ridden and full of plot-holes.
0,"Not so much a contemporary re-make of Joseph Ruben's 1987 psychological thriller as a lobotomised bastard step-child: over-plotted, over-long, and stripped of the original's sharp, satirical subversion of suburban family values."
1,"If the movie's attic-bound climax is a little predictable and the plot holes rather gaping, The Stepfather, unlike many of its more prestigious A-class competitors, is never less than entertaining."
1,"It's all very silly, but effective popcorn entertainment."
0,Nelson McCormick is ridiculously lax with inventive or plausible staging: it's the kind of movie where a door can't open without thunderclaps and the bad guy flinging himself into the frame.
0,"The Stepfather is full of unintentional laughs, shameless plot contrivances and cheap scare tactics, but this adds to the fun once you've tapped into the risible nature of the production."
0,"Lazy, predictable and seriously lacking in shocks."
0,This rehash - toned (and dumbed) down for adolescent audiences by the director responsible for taking the slash out of Prom Night - provides thin gruel.
0,"Mercilessly talky and deathly dull, this bloodless, sex-less misfire plays more like a housewife-baiting telemovie than the taut, teen-centric psycho-thriller it's supposed to be."
0,McCormick's lacklustre reboot is just another indistinguishable psycho thriller.
0,"A pointless, dumbed-down remake of a slasher movie of the same name."
0,"Uninspiring and, crucially, not all that scary. There are no attempts either to explore the killer's motivation and none of the original's black humour."
0,It has some good moments but there are much better relationships you could be having at the cinema than with The Stepfather.
0,Fond memories of Joseph Ruben's thrillingly unpleasant B-movie of 1987 will be offended by this bland and almost blood-free remake.
0,"The new version is serviceable, bland and forgettable."
0,This is multiplex fodder for the (very) undemanding: they should give this kind of cinematic junk food away free with the popcorn.
0,The Stepfather is watchable enough in a good bad movie sort of way but the finale is disappointing and it fails to improve on the original film.
0,Forgettable but watchable pap - in a leave-your-brain-at-home sort of way.
0,Any subtlety or implicit social satire to be found in Joseph Ruben's original went out with the last neighborhood trash pickup. Too bad the service was canceled before it could haul away this waste-of-time remake. [Blu-ray]
0,"The genre has diverged into two paths: the brutally gruesome and the suspenseful. This is going for the latter, which would have been fine if it were in fact thrilling."
1,Horror remake has more tension than blood.
0,
0,What a shame that the remake fell into the unwieldy hands of the same jokers responsible for last year's execrable Prom Night redo.
0,Walsh's performance as David is so limp that it's difficult to imagine David outwitting any of his victims in the film.
1,"Takita's serio-comic look at life, death, redemption and forgiveness, is Japan's entry for the Oscars, winning audience awards in festivals, which speak well of its potential commercial appeal outside Asia."
1,TV scribe Kundo Koyama's first bigscreen script peppers the proceedings with rich character detail and near-screwball interludes that shouldn't fit but somehow do.
0,"Kalogyrismeno kai tairiasta fotografimeno, alla thanatifora stoiheiodes kai (thelo na pisteyo) kseperasmeno thematika"
0,From a critical standpoint Departures doesn't warrant altering itineraries to see.
1,A fine film that's gently funny and moving and not the least bit challenging or controversial.
1,"A sumptuous, richly composed drama that considers big, broad emotional issues with a sweeping cinematic canvas."
1,An encoffiner works outside the box in this enthralling winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Picture of 2008.
1,It feels like a singularly great film when one understands its plot as a daringly paradoxical apologia for Japan's moribund taboo.
0,The sweeping music and bucolic landscape serve to heap on the emotion to Takita's already heavy-handed manipulation.
0,Departures needed a little more work in the morgue -- like cutting to the bone.
1,This is truly masterful and glorious filmmaking that's guaranteed a spot in my Top 10 of the year.
0,"It's far too long, too self-conscious of its dramatic intentions, and too emotionally distant."
1,"Like Sunshine Cleaning, this is a gentle comic tale of grisly ?쮍mployment opportunity in desperate times. Only Departures is tender and, at times, rather squishy."
1,"""Departures"" is a brilliantly written and performed story that transcends its themes of ritualized catharsis to bring the audience to a fresh understanding of man's need to make peace with the deceased."
1,"Departures is built for simplicity, and, if nothing else, the appeal to decency and integrity of this sweetly old-fashioned tale make it a must for Bernie Madoff's prison Netflix queue."
1,"An exquisite cinematic masterpiece that is both funny and sad and all the emotions in between; it touches the heart with its treatment of beauty, music, death, and abandonment."
1,Easily the best movie I've seen thus far this year...beautifully done.
1,"Multiplexes are crowded with noisy summer films, from which Departures will represent a sophisticated and elegant departure."
0,Too long by a solid 30 minutes and riddled with clich챕s of every creed and color
0,Here's a great way to start savoring life: Don't waste it on pat manipulations like this.
1,"The plot involves some developments we can see coming, but they seem natural, inevitable. The music is lush and sentimental in a subdued way, the cinematography is perfectly framed and evocative, and the movie is uncommonly absorbing."
1,"An incredibly fulfilling movie experience...In a season devoted to movies that go crash-bang-boom, this film offers quiet joy, beauty %u2013 and an amazing array of feelings."
1,This Oscar winning film about death is actually a joyous hymn to life.
1,"Director Yojiro Takita uses the changing seasons to echo the characters' moods; the score by Joe Hisaishi (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) has a suitably majestic sweep."
1,Count on the first tear to fall by the 55-minute mark.
1,"A tremendously moving experience filled with warmth, wisdom, intelligence and tenderness sprinkled with just the right dash of humor to balance the heaviness and keeps you thoroughly enthralled."
1,"Takita is blessed with actors who move lightly, gracefully within this landscape."
0,"[Director] Takita could easily trim 30 minutes of flab and oceans of tears from Departures. It still wouldn't merit an Oscar, but it would be a lot more watchable."
0,"The performances are nice, the vibe is pretty much spot-on, but the movie itself almost can't help but under whelm, none of it ever rising to the level it needs to in order to fully connect."
1,The film is far from perfect but has enough going on to compensate for its excessive length and some sentimentality.
1,"Though events unravel predictably, the film is profoundly affecting, thanks to a well-written story, rich characters and superlative acting."
1,"Fully deserving of every ounce of gold on its Oscar, Departures' amazing achievement is in being a film about death that is so truly beautiful, joyful and life-affirming."
0,"It is, I'm afraid, unlikely to reflect much glory on the Oscar nomination process and the voters in general."
0,"Overlong, predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos."
1,"A quiet, measured picture, somewhat clinical in its opening passages. But that gives way to the tremendous emotion of its closing sequences, and that final scene is a wrecker."
0,
1,
1,
0,"...the senior supporting players in the film are affecting and the film's underlying sentiment is honorable, but lead actor Masahiro Motoki shamefacedly mugs through this cloying and cliched film which director Takita lets drag on interminably."
0,"Though not unpleasant, Departures can't reconcile its bawdy sense of humor with the tiresome sentimentality that always lurks not far behind."
1,"Departures is a film steeped in warmth, tenderness and genuine conflict."
1,Incredibly moving.
0,"An overlong, sap-happy crowd-pleaser."
1,"The ultimate beauty of the film rests in its symbolic details that bridge the abyss between the living and the dead. As the French might say, it is to make one cry."
1,"Departures is such an elegant, beautifully mounted meditation on death, funeral customs and parent-child relations that you may find yourself sniffling and resisting simultaneously."
1,A wistful masterpiece.
1,I found myself watching the clock and begging for this bloated opus to end.
1,Yojiro Takita's movie simultaneously tickles tears of mourning as it wrings laughs about the meaning of life.
1,"Despite its Hollywood-friendliness, Departures never seems less than an utterly sincere, four-hankie movie about finding oneself."
0,"It breaks no new ground, offers no audacious insights or rude revelations; toe follows tac as surely as tac follows tic."
1,The creepiest aspect of Departures -- dead people -- ends up being what's most beautiful about it.
1,"Departures quietly subverts aesthetic and emotional expectations. There are moments where the story could turn maudlin or veer into bad taste, but the high-minded intent is never lost."
1,This is the kind of tastefully poignant drama that asks its audience to confront taboos and then pats them on the back for doing so.
1,"It is the type of film that needs some time to find its story and its characters. This thoughtful drama is pretty rewarding, though the very deliberate tempo may test the patience of some."
1,"There's naturally a lot of death, but Departures is also about the circle of life, family relationships, pride in one's purpose, and all the messiness those things can bring."
1,"It is as polished as it is heavy-handed, and it leaves one under a spell."
0,"Such modestly crafted moral tales sometimes manage win the audience over, but here the tone wavers too much for sincerity to be felt."
1,"Occasionally goes saccharine, [but] mostly succeeds in telling an unusual story in an engaging way."
1,"There is nothing so sparkling to this film at first glance. It's a film about man's mortality and how he handles it, but death is not cleverly hidden inside a bigger story. It's a wake-up slap in the face about the gritty part of dying: the bodies."
1,Departures is a loving tribute to the Japanese way of death.
1,The winning nature of the performances outweighs Takita's more obvious choices.
1,"Departures is sometimes macabre and sometimes manipulative, but the way it speaks to the spirit is miraculous."
1,"...feels like two films, one which is a perceptive and naturalistic study of modern life in Japan, and one which is an animated Hallmark card of montages and soaring strings..."
1,"A compassionate and wry character study of a man who, finding himself at a crossroads, is reborn through death."
1,"One of the best movies released this year, it will be included on my year-end top 10 list. This movie has a personal touch that never wears out its welcome..."
1,"Absolutely, beautifully, tear duct openingly right."
1,"The ending, which involves a rock, would wring tears from a stone."
1,"Redeems a trite 'redemptive' story about family with hushed, beautifully staged sequences of 'encoffinment'..."
1,A moving celebration of life through showing reverence for death.
1,"The film's tone lies, appropriately, somewhere between life, death, and the inadvertent humor that comes from finally accepting the yin/yang perfection of both and getting on with what comes between."
1,A surprisingly uplifting examination of life and loss.
1,The film has enjoyed tremendous acclaim but I hesitate to recommend it unreservedly. Better to lower your expectations and discover those elements that touch you most deeply without waiting for the film to deliver something that it doesn't really promise
1,"Departures is a great film and, yes, you're going to need your reading glasses -- this one is subtitled."
1,"Oscar can be a big softie, as proved by how it presented itself to this sweet, sober chamber piece about living life and handling death."
1,"Yojiro Takita has crafted a rich, memorable and thoroughly unconventional film that celebrates finding your own particular place in a world full of surprising opportunities."
1,The film seduces us into this world with such affection and beauty.
1,"Beautifully acted and classically filmed, Departures is a gentle, wise, immensely appealing film."
1,"Like the art of encoffinment itself, Departures unfolds with a delicacy and precision that slowly captivates the viewer."
1,It's an affecting experience (you'll need to bring some tissues) but rest assured it's a joyous one too.
1,Takita eventually pushes the emotions too hard but by then I had lost all resistance. It's a beautiful film but take two hankies.
1,"Departures is about life, death, grief and loss, but it's also, in a quietly effective way, about coming to terms with expectations."
1,"Despite a lengthy running time and a few pacing issues, Departures is still worth seeing, thanks to its moving script and engaging performances."
1,"Heart-warming, funny, wise and profound. Not to be missed."
0,"The movie gestures towards deep emotions, but an abiding soft-grained superficiality effectively insulates us from the piercing realities of grief."
1,"Doesn't quite justify the enormous plaudits heaped upon its shoulders, but a warm-hearted comedy-drama with its own likeably odd sensibility."
1,"Fascinating, witty and heartfelt."
0,Yjir Takita's bitter-sweet tale of the Japanese funeral trade plays a bit like a formal service itself.
1,A safe and emotionally generous crowd-pleaser.
1,"Moments of clarity and pragmatism are contradicted by flashes of inanity and dry, if well-delivered humour."
1,Departures's whimsical take on the Japanese funeral industry proves surprisingly funny.
1,"Departure's cynicism, ironically, is what makes the optimism of its last act so moving."
1,A sentimental but beguiling charmer of a film.
1,"In the end, it's powerfully moving, and perhaps a bit too nice."
1,Director Yojiro Takita and writer Kundo Kayama ... aren't afraid to give you an emotional punch as well as a punchline.
0,This Japanese film's receipt of the award for best foreign-language picture at this year's Oscars was a case of the Academy favouring bland sentimentality.
1,"The film, mostly set in a wintry landscape surrounded by snow-capped mountains, is fastidiously composed."
1,"This heartfelt, unpretentious, slyly funny Japanese film is worth waiting for."
1,like the unfolding of a Mozart concerto
1,"Lead Masahiro Motoki apprenticed with real nakanshi for the role, and you become entranced by his performance, and the gentle clash of ritual and grief, custom and modernity."
1,"Death is normal, and so are responsibilities, reconciliations and retreats from what we think are our dreams. In a resolution about identifying ourselves, and loved ones, in life and death, ""Departures"" shows some people must be left just as they went."
1,No doubt the best movie you'll see this year about the Japanese traditional funeral business.
1,
0,"The scripting of Departures (by Kundo Koyama, the one-man TV-drama writing factory who nurtured such delights as Iron Chef) is embarrassingly clunky and obvious: the movie's essential hollowness reveals itself with unusual starkness."
1,"The laughter and family fights that break out at funerals might be part of this movie's rural, working-class eye. Departures favors farmland and old-fashioned wood-fired bathhouses over the Tokyo mania. It celebrates old-style, hands-on craft."
0,"The encoffination ritual has a subtlety and grace that's lacking in Takita's direction, which lays down the narrative with slow, heavy brushstrokes of lacquered whimsy."
1,All three actors are skilled in communicating difficult emotions just with their faces and in bringing to life the gentle humor that leavens this very affecting movie about death and letting go.
1,"In ""Departures, life and death are two expressive movements of one musical"" piece. Neither is taken as a polar opposite of the other; they dance rhythmically, like the ebb and flow of the ocean tide."
1,"A charming, winning piece of filmmaking that, while in no way deserving of the title of Best Foreign Language film of this or any year, is a heartwarming and bittersweet tale that hits all the right notes."
1,"Hampered by pacing that borders on glacial, the performances infuse the story with lingering melancholy."
1,"Naturalistic performances, long takes, unfussy edits and a story that unfolds over a few hours are all present and correct."
1,Small but sharp and extremely well observed.
1,An impressive chamber piece by a director who needs watching.
1,"This is a tough, shrewd, intelligent movie."
1,"This is superior film-making, equally comfortable with the light (Boogie's obvious delight in his nipper and the realistic family dynamic) to the dark (his risibly macho deceipt with a jolly hooker)."
1,"It may not scale the heights of the best recent Romanian films (4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days, The Death Of Mr Lazarescu) but Boogie is still a bittersweet character study."
1,"The film remains dour, truthful, grimly droll."
1,"Superbly acted, sharply observed and impressively directed Romanian drama, though it drags a little in the early stages."
1,"Three 30-somethings relive their gloriously lurid college days for one night only in Radu Muntean's Boogie, a restrained and honest look at the male midlife crisis in an embryonic state."
1,"Watching these women perform is a striking lesson in ballet's rigorous aesthetic alchemy -- and the extreme, exquisite individualism that prevails."
0,Ballerina has the feel of a propaganda puff piece put out by the Russian tourist board.
0,"A close-up but still, one senses, heavily idealized documentary portrait."
1,"Skillfully written and entertaining documentary that is also a clever investigation into the professional lives of the world's best dancers, the ballerinas of Russia's Kirov Ballet."
1,"That something so beautiful can exist in this modern world is, itself, a source of wonder."
1,"Ballerina will be of interest mostly to balletomanes, but even folks who don't know their right foot from their left will find inspiration in the lives of these devoted dancers. Besides, who isn't moved by Swan Lake?"
1,"If only a glimpse, the privilege compensates: one wants more from Ballerina because the world it reveals -- elegant and harsh, glamorous and grinding, classical and obsolete -- proves so rich in exquisite contradictions."
1,A refreshing and illuminating portrait of five new stars in Russian ballet.
1,
1,Ballet lovers will enjoy the footage of the young ballerinas taking command of their respective performances.
0,"Mildly compelling and somewhat fascinating, but often tedious, incomplete and lacking enough insight about what it's truly like to be a ballerina."
1,"Such a brief glimpse into these women's lives and art whets the appetite for more; alas, Ballerina ends far too quickly, leaving only their willowy shadows behind."
1,"Anyone who knows about ballet will find much to recognize in the lives of these young women, but for those who do not, the film will be a revelation."
1,"Not as perceptive as Etoiles or as ... entertaining as Ballets Russes, [but] still a glimpse into a priviledged, ruthlessly demanding world few outsiders ever get to see."
1,Even those skeptical of ballet will likely be entranced.
1,"...Ballerina looks behind the scenes ...to offer a closer look at the system of selection, training and rehearsal which keeps Russian ballet the envy of the world."
0,"It's too levelheaded, too aesthetically old-fashioned and academic."
1,A jewel of a documentary.
0,"While the mysterious air of the ballerina is preserved, a chance to reveal the real people behind the iconic, ethereal image is squandered."
1,"... in its simplistic, by-the-book delivery, Ballerina does give an inkling of the blood and sweat hidden underneath the ethereal beauty of classical dance."
1,The movie is an admirable look into the venerable St. Petersburg company and how dancers thrive or just survive in the physically challenging world of dance.
1,"As dazzling as they can be in performance, the ballerinas are even more breathtaking when a camera catches them alone in the shadows, dancing only for themselves."
1,"Dance aficionados will be sent over the moon by this compelling documentary from director Bertrand Norman, chronicling what it takes to be a prima ballerina in the Mariinski Theatre."
1,
1,"This rare, behind-the-scenes dance film, which is more a profile of dancers than of the dance, shows that Russia and its famed Kirow are still the world's core of ballet."
1,Behind-the-curtains has never been more ravishing nor more rewarding
0,It's not quite nutty enough to be a guilty pleasure.
1,"It's creaky, predictable and frequently idiotic. But for a tipsy Saturday night, this should tick all the right boxes."
0,"Not only bad in predictable ways, it's obscenely lazy."
0,A cheerfully terrible January time-waster.
0,This is how 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' would have turned out if it had been funny unintentionally instead of intentionally.
0,A 14th-century road movie with 21st-century cuss words.
0,Great song. Bad movie.
0,"Stop me if you've heard this one. A priest, an altar boy, two Crusaders, and a con artist walk toward an abbey with a suspected witch in tow."
0,The first reveal of Nicolas Cage sporting a blond wig with ringlets that makes him look like a Shirley Temple drag queen impersonator after a post-medieval-party-themed blackout is the sort of fright probably not intended by its makers.
0,"Season of the Witch isn't quite Jonah Hex or Little Fockers bad, but it's one helluva shoddy way to start off the year in movies and yet another crummy entry in Nicolas Cage's woeful post-Oscar filmography."
0,"A CGI freakout at the finale can't save this mundane medieval thriller about witches, devils and disillusioned knights."
0,Season of the Witch is a fine example of a film that would've been great fun if only its creators had a sense of humor about the wild brew of absurdity they had percolating.

0,"Directed by the perennially hollow Dominic Sena from a script by Bragi Schut, ""Season of the Witch"" is all seams. It never balances out its competing desires..."
0,"A mediocre knights-and-witchcraft B-movie that's somewhat cheesy, somewhat intriguing, and ultimately just not all that involving."
0,"The stench of plague is all around, unless that's an aroma emanating from the script."
0,"It's entertaining in a cheerfully ridiculous way, though Cage fans will be disappointed that he does not really lose his rag, despite some serious provocation from the Lord of Darkness."
