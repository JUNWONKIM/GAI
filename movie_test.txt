Rating	Review
1	"... mining horror out of moral quandary rather than mindless slaughter, Splice occasionally achieves a terrible beauty."
0	A thoroughly repulsive science fiction-horror flick that slicks up its B-movie tawdriness with high-gloss production values and two otherwise classy stars.
1	"Brody and Polley's performances keep the film grounded in a semblance of reality even when it threatens to go over the top near the end, and director Natali infuses the proceedings with a consistent sense of nail-biting dread."
0	"It wants to tour the scarred human psyche, yet the cobbled-together screenplay is silly when it should be spooky, cold when it should boil over and dumb when it should be smart."
1	"[It's] witty, aware of its own craziness, and disarmingly insightful about the psychology of its characters."
1	"This Cronenbergian exploration of the perils of inter-species gene-splicing wrestles with some topical and disturbing ideas, but never quite pins them down."
0	
1	"Deftly sustaining many points of view, engrossing feature begins to seem overloaded only toward the end."
1	"No hour-and-a-half documentary can do much more than scratch the surface of the issue, but Mathew and DeVivo provide an excellent primer and some human faces on the front lines."
1	"Crossing Arizona doesn't propose many solutions, but it's best when it's giving us an on-the-ground feel for the people who live closest to a problem that continues to dominate the news."
1	The filmmakers' point is undeniable: Two governments have deftly pitted working and hoping-to-work folk against each other to cruel effect.
0	"Cute and clever though the plot may be, everything is played out in the broadest possible terms without an iota of nuance or subtlety."
1	"It's Complicated is middle-aged porn, the specialty of Meyers, ??who also set ladies and interior ??decorators drooling over homes and gardens in 2006's The Holiday."
0	The story's not entirely predictable. Yet it's anything but complicated.
1	"Streep and Baldwin are terrific, and if you like your romance bittersweet you won't want to miss this one."
1	This is a comfort zone for such viewers even if the characters are no more real than the models in Vanity Fair ads.
1	A silly but mostly delectable holiday confection guaranteed to put a smile on your face and keep it there.
1	You don't have to feel guilty for lapping up this froth. Just don't expect nourishment.
1	Beneath this movie's gleaming high-end surfaces beats the heart of a classic screwball comedy.
0	"Meyers uses musical montages and shoots the principals doubling over in laughter in place of crafting witty dialogue. Escapism has its place at the movies, but something this slick is like a lavishly wrapped but empty Christmas present."
1	"Meyers has dropped something a bit more subtle than her usual anvil. This one is more like a mere tire iron, but at least we've got Baldwin: He's the pixie dust that chases away the ensuing headache."
0	I found myself wishing for more shallows and fewer depths.
1	"The empowerment message is obvious, the strain of trying to be ""hip"" and edgy in the script shows. But Meyers sets the table for funny people to deliver laughs."
1	"Say this for Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin: They're professionals, and their relaxed chemistry and good humor together carries the film surprisingly far."
0	Does Nancy Meyers hate women?
1	"It's simply a good time, a relatively adult and easygoing conveyance for three ace performers of a certain age, working through a few comic machinations created by writer-director Nancy Meyers."
1	Snappy dialogue and an up-tempo pop soundtrack add to It's Complicated's entertaining mix as director Nancy Meyers proves again that she has a deft hand with rom-coms.
0	"Meyers demonstrates, as she did in Something's Gotta Give and The Holiday, an extraordinarily limited worldview."
0	"Meyers does her job pretty well. She's a clever contriver, adept at adding a patina of apparent relevance, even a veneer of feminism, to situations that are otherwise bogus and artificial."
0	"It's Complicated is a rearrangement of the goods in Nancy Meyers' bakery, and some of them belong on the day-old shelf."
1	"Yes, it coulda had more laughs, but in the spirit of seasonal good cheer, let me predict that the best-chocolate-croissant-making montage in Hollywood history is going to help this one clean up at the box office."
1	"With a story that by turns defies and adheres to formulas, It's Complicated ends up being one of the end-year's best sources of pure entertainment."
1	"It's Complicated unleashes an unabashedly, desperately romantic side of Baldwin that we haven't seen before. He doesn't steal this movie so much as grant all Streep's fluttering and twirling and hand-fanning an exuberant counterweight."
0	"There's nothing inherently wrong with a little fantasy; indeed, a lot of us like gazing at lavishly set tables and meticulously chosen throw pillows. But It's Complicated suffers from terminal niceness."
0	"Actually, Hollywood, it's very simple: If you're lucky enough to rope pros like Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin into a formulaic comedy that's clearly beneath them, you rise to the occasion."
1	The romantic comedy about a divorced couple having an affair manages to be both light on its feet and heavy enough to deliver something of a message.
1	I enjoyed the spectacle of middle-aged people making spectacles of themselves. And I appreciated the film's gentle understanding of how the romance of a parent affects the children.
1	"The truth is that everyone needs a little coddling, which could be the key to Ms. Meyers's peculiar talent: She pampers her audience shamelessly."
0	"A movie that's one-third hilarious is better than no thirds at all, but look at the cast: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. Doesn't that promise a somewhat larger fraction of laughs?"
1	"For Streep, as always, acting is anything but complicated."
0	There are four reasons to see this movie and writer-director Nancy Meyers isn't one.
1	"It's Complicated is basically Wild Hogs for smart people, big stars playing below their gifts in a crowd-pleasing movie."
0	"[Meyers has] given us her thinnest slice of comic relationship angst yet, proving, I guess, that you actually can be too thin."
0	"Writer-director Meyers, who's devoted much of her career to midlife American arousal, that she loses her sense of fun."
1	"Simply put, It's Complicated is a hoot."
1	Streep's dilemma is handled well enough for the movie to accumulate some gravitas as it nears the two-hour mark.
1	"Streep is as enjoyable as ever, and if laughs count for anything, this is one of the better romantic comedies of the season."
1	It's Complicated is the kind of wholesome adult-oriented entertainment that once formed the bedrock of classical Hollywood.
1	"For me, Meyers's romcoms have been unwatchable because of the utter fakeness of their leading players: but I must confess, Baldwin and Streep do have that most over-analysed thing, ""chemistry."""
1	"No one's calling it great art. But as an indulgent confection, it's more filling and less embarrassing than we had any right to expect."
1	"It may not be the saviour of romantic comedies, but this is an enjoyable film with great leads and comic chops. Complicated? Not really, but it is a laugh."
1	"It's Complicated is another Streepshow, like Mamma Mia, that illustrates the power and willingness of Hollywood's best actress to slough inhibitions like Salome's veils."
0	"On it drags, simpering the while over the lavish accoutrements of upper-middle-class life as though they contained the key to all happiness - which, in Meyers's worldview, they probably do."
0	A slice of pure Hollywood hokum overstaying its welcome by at least 15 long minutes.
1	"A refined, balanced and eminently funny film, featuring three sublime performances from its incredibly talented leads."
1	"It's really not all that complicated. But it is entertaining. It's pure, simple fun, with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin playing Doris Day and Rock Hudson as they might have been if they had ruled in the sexually knowing oughts, instead of the virginal ear"

1	"The movie won't take you to the top of the mountain or leave you with memories and references for discussion, but you won't be bored if you see it. Without compromising my standards, I can give this film an unqualified +."
1	Every once in a while it's good to see a movie that makes the blood boil.
1	"Skillful, unsparing and blessed with a great protagonist, The Cove is smart enough to stir up as much interest in its cause as Who Killed the Electric Car? did with the shuttered EV1, provided its post-festival word of mouth continues to build."
1	The end of The Cove is as rousing as anything from Hollywood. Manipulative? Sure -- but isn't that fitting?
1	"The Cove is properly enchanting, horrifying, and rousing, but it comes dangerously close to making the narcissistic case that dolphins deserve to be saved because they're cute and breathe air like we do."
1	"Casting a very wide net, this powerful polemic is simultaneously a love letter to a beloved species, an eye-opening primer on worldwide dolphin captivity, a playful paranoid thriller and a work of deep-seated (if sometimes hot-headed) moral outrage."
1	A documentary that mixes advocacy journalism with the suspenseful thrill of a caper.
1	It's both an educational work of art and a classic espionage tale.
1	"A suspenseful, compelling indictment of Japan's deadly dolphin-exploitation industry."
1	The Cove doesn't always give you the facts you want. Yet its images of blood in the water are worth a thousand preachy words.
1	"It has the breathless pace of a Bourne movie, but none of the comfort of fiction. This is documentary filmmaking at its most exciting and purposeful."
1	"The Cove offers a lot to think about in terms of the future of fishing, and Psihoyos' gift for using fiction-feature conventions does make a seemingly unpalatable subject entertaining."
1	"The effectiveness of The Cove also comes from its explosive cinematic craft, its surprising good humor and its pure excitement."
1	"Two fins up for The Cove, a documentary that whales on evil Japanese fishermen who kill dolphins for lunch meat."
1	The Cove's story of a quiet village in Japan that specializes in clandestine dolphin slaughter is quite consciously structured as a thriller by director Louie Psihoyos who won an audience award for it at Sundance.
1	"This film is less a work of journalism than a call to activism; movies like The Cove, to a certain extent, preach to the converted."
0	"The film makes its case graphically, to say the least, yet muddies its bloody waters with an excess of artifice and a dearth of facts."
1	"The movie is a Trojan horse: an exceptionally well-made documentary that unfolds like a spy thriller, complete with bugged hotel rooms, clandestine derring-do and mysterious men in gray flannel suits."
1	"For a generation that grew up with Flipper and The Day of the Dolphin, the tense, powerful new documentary, The Cove, is a horror movie."
1	"The Cove is a thriller in a classical sense. It's the first of these movies to tell a story with more than stock footage and on-camera interviews. It also smartly refracts a major ethical, ecological problem through the prism of guerrilla events."
1	"A gripping thriller about dolphin trafficking, The Cove is an eco-mentary that's as passionate and persuasive an argument for change as An Inconvenient Truth."
1	There are many documentaries angry about the human destruction of the planetary peace. This is one of the very best -- a certain Oscar nominee.
1	"There are five minutes in this documentary that ought to be mandatory viewing. The entire 90 minutes is utterly compelling, but the five alone are worth the price of admission."
1	"The film is paced like a thriller, written as an expose and intended as a call to arms for ecologists, animal lovers and moviegoers around the world."
1	"Psihoyos and his team got the footage they were after -- thanks to meticulous planning, lots of furtive sneaking around and the judicious placement of underwater microphones and cameras disguised as rocks."
1	"Beyond the high-stakes game of cat and mouse, the film explores the mysterious relationship between humans and dolphins and the unexplainable connection between our two species."
1	"Directed by Louie Psihoyos, this well-intentioned documentary exposes the harvesting of dolphins by Japanese fishermen, yet its theatrics suggest a cross between reality TV and Mission: Impossible."
1	The Cove is one of the best in a growing class of nonfiction films
1	The Cove plays like the James Bond version of an environmental doc. It could also be viewed as a horror movie for the carnage it depicts. Yet it's quite simply one of the year's best movies.
1	"It is filmmaking not just in the service of the environment, but in the service of a victim, and while that victim may have flippers and fins, it is straight from central casting."
1	"It is put together so smartly you can almost feel the urgency - from the patient set-up, which lays on the information and statistics without getting boring or too preachy, to the horrific finale."
1	"It is overwhelming, compelling and very depressing. In short, The Cove does its job very, very well."
1	"As the subject of a documentary, this grim enterprise distinctly lacks the warm and fuzzy appeal of The March of the Penguins. So director Louie Psihoyos ingeniously reinvents his film as a spy caper."
1	"In effect, by looking at nature The Cove shows us what it means to be human."
1	"The Cove is guerrilla journalism at its best. Structured and paced by director Louie Psihoyos as a thriller/caper movie, it brings audience-grabbing cinematic conventions to work in telling its story of dolphin genocide"
1	There's an effective thriller element to this vividly assembled doc.
1	"The great strength of this documentary about the covert killing of wild dolphins in Japan is its aesthetic: artful edits, zippy music, even a few jokes. Radical stuff for an eco-documentary."
1	"One would imagine, and hope, that an Oscar nomination beckons."
1	"Facts, stats and grim archive footage help build up a convincing if one-sided case, but it is the film's revelatory covert recording that encapsulates the true power of documentary cinema."
1	Restrained and harrowing.
1	"The Cove does what every great documentary with a cause should: It educates, entertains, and inspires audiences to take action."

0	
1	A menacing pseudo-horror thriller with arty aspirations.
0	Du Welz never manages to generate enough menace - this is no Apocalypse Now.
1	A dark and pessimistic drama which goes slap-happily mad towards the end but keeps you watching all the same.
1	"The buoyant little comedy 12:08 East of Bucharest puts its finger on the problem in the best tradition of East European humor, savvy but concrete, gentle but sharp as a knife."
1	"Though it is modest, almost anecdotal, in scale, 12:08 East of Bucharest is also characterized by a precise and sneaky formal wit."
1	The most hilarious movie I've seen this year.
1	A casually bleak and neatly structured ensemble comedy -- at once deadpan and bemused.
1	A bleakly hilarious movie.
1	"12:08 East of Bucharest is a shrewdly built comedy, but the characters are broad-verging-on-cheap unholy hick fools."
1	Corneliu Porumboiu's picture would submerge you in alcoholic despair if it weren't so damn funny. (That seems to be the Romanian mode of expression.)
1	"It's easy to end a film with the idea that life goes on. It's extremely difficult to make the cliche the only possible, necessary and satisfying ending. Porumboiu's film does that."
1	"It's a dark little ride, but at the end the lights hesitantly flicker back on."
1	[It] builds a sly and unexpected human comedy out of a dispute over whether a revolution would still be a revolution if nobody showed up.
1	Live television going down in flames is always good for a laugh.
1	The only problem with the new Romanian cinema seems to be titles few can easily remember - but some eccentricity is permissible when the films are so good.
1	"A melancholy rumination on the failed hopes of Eastern Europe after the Cold War, infused with a sense of farce and the irrecoverable nature of the past."
1	A terrifically droll and slyly incisive comedy.
1	"The central European tradition of failed aspirations, lost ideals and forlorn eccentrics goes back to early Forman, or indeed Chekhov, but the Latin Romanians bring their own awareness of the distant big city alternately beckoning and frightening."
1	"It won the best first film award at Cannes; somehow, it doesn't seem quite substantial enough to justify that accolade."
1	"Beautifully observed and very funny, this film is a real treat."
1	"A funny, gentle film that understands the wearying nature of political upheaval."
1	Black comedy with a subtle political edge.
1	"12:08 East of Bucharest cleverly takes on the aftermath of the December 1989 revolution in Romania that resulted in the overthrow of Nicolae Ceaucescu. It's a movie that seems simple, yet its subtle and brilliant complexity is not to be denied."
1	"Porumboiu's satire about history and short memories is a modest, deadpan masterpiece."
0	"12:08 East of Bucharest is easier to admire than enjoy, funnier to describe than actually watch."
1	"Dry comedies from eastern Europe tend to cast a skeptical eye on anything and everything, which is certainly the case with Corneliu Porumboiu's debut feature."

0	"Clearly a labor of love, but one destined perhaps to be loved by a very select few."
1	"Mary And Max is original, personal, funny and moving; a film of warmth and compassion from a major artist."
1	"Only long after the film, and with considerable effort, do you have to remind yourself that what you went all weak-kneed and misty-eyed over was a blob of plasticine -- a superbly directed blob of plasticine."
1	Remarkable and poignant...
0	The mixture of artistic sophistication and emotional crudeness cancel each other out.
1	"In a perverse and often immature way, it forthrightly deals with mature issues of love, friendship, forgiveness and mental health. It requires a mature audience, but an audience nonetheless."
1	"While perhaps it doesn't fully sustain its 90-odd-minute running time, Mary and Max is a moving celebration of oddness and friendship."
0	"Too long and wretched for children (Max is obese, receives electric shock therapy, and lives a life of neurotic misery) and yet surely too ""kooky"" for any sane adult (irritatingly camp words such as ""smudgling"")."
1	"A very odd, very unlikely animated film from Australia that manages to be sickly-cute, alarmingly grotesque, and right-on at the same time -- often in the very same scene."
1	"Up may be a really good film, but compared to Mary and Max it's an episode of Thundercats."
1	"Elliot is a talent eccentric enough to make Nick Park look like an office drone, and the serious sadness underpinning his vision only makes the humour work better."
1	"It's a 20-year story that absorbs and beguiles, despite the ugly subject matter."
1	"This clay animation feels as if it was written by the early Woody Allen. Actually the genius behind it is Adam Elliot, who wrote, designed and directed this eccentric, wryly funny story."
0	"Kabir Khan's New York -- part Bollywood potboiler, part overwrought examination of the war on terror -- is a slice of the Big Apple that you should skip."
0	"A predictable, brow-furrowing drama (sadly songless except for a couple of Sunday-in-the-park montage sequences) about the effects of 9/11 (and 9/11 paranoia) on some South Asian immigrants living in New York."
1	"It's a remarkable history, rich in comedy and occasionally heartbreaking, filled with wise reflections and strange digressions about the wonders of life."
1	"Although the film is a routine thriller with few surprises, it deserves attention because its topic, even eight years after Sept. 11, is one that many South Asian Americans still take very seriously."
1	"For quick, lively, family friendly entertainment, ""Puss in Boots"" works just fine, even in 3-D, which is integrated thoughtfully into the narrative and doesn't just feel like a gimmick."
1	Puss' origin story could easily stand on its own -- a testament to clever writing on the part of its creative team and an irresistible central performance by Antonio Banderas.
1	"Colorful, clever enough, free of cloying showbiz in-jokes, action-packed without being ridiculous about it and even well choreographed..."
1	"...simple, sincere and largely innocent."
1	"As good as Banderas and Hayek are together, Galifianakis is better, making Humpty-Dumpty, of all people, one of the more intriguing animated characters to come along in awhile. He's a nice surprise."
0	"Who needs a narrative when you've got a few funny lines (caught with catnip, Puss declares it's ""for my glaucoma""), a Morricone knockoff score and a climactic sequence with something we'll call Goosezilla?"
1	A cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting.
1	"Perhaps the most engaging thing about ""Puss in Boots"" is that it never takes itself too seriously."
1	"Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2,"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not a moment too soon."
1	It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience all the way up the line.
1	"""Puss in Boots'' doesn't break any new ground in the storytelling department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike..."
0	"In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, is that no one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes."
1	"Even if they don't provide much lift, these boots were made for amusement."
0	"Even for a Shrek spin-off, Puss In Boots is mighty thin gruel, based more in outsized emotion than actual narrative."
1	I left dreaming of a world in which cats could tango - and when's the last time a movie did that?
1	"The cat came back. Good thing, too."
1	"Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious."
1	An almost purr-fect little film that even a dog owner can enjoy.
1	"It would overstate matters to say Puss in Boots leaves its cat holding the bag (we had to get that in). But it also leaves its hero awaiting a richer fable, one befitting his charms and his portrayer's talents."
1	"The character may be here to save the day, but the movie's only here to pass the time and it does that just fine."
1	It's the morally-cracked Humpty who provides the film's emotional trajectory. Puss in Boots is a fun feline frolic -- with just a little egg on its face.
1	Almost shockingly good. And not just because a lot of you will approach it with lowered expectations.
1	"With his impeccable comic timing and lyrical Spanish accent, Banderas' swashbuckling charmer is an undeniable treat."
0	"Basically, this toon is a tired riff on Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, punctuated by more puns and cat jokes than you can shake a litter box at."
1	"The moment that Puss made his debut in Shrek 2, dramatically voiced by Antonio Banderas, and all but walked away with the picture, it was clear that DreamWorks Animation had created a resonant character."
1	"'Puss in Boots' is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven."
1	"It's all amiable stuff, with a perfectly decent script, and the feline hero lapping his milk gets an indulgent laugh."
0	"Most of the jokes fit into two categories: ""Ha ha, he's Spanish"" and ""Ha ha, he's a cat""."
1	"Puss in Boots is very jolly for an hour. Then, like Santa Claus misjudging a chimney, it gets stuck at the moment we hope it will break free and distribute the festive gifts."
1	this western-parodying cat-with-too-many-names is closer to Rango than to anything from the Kingdom of Far Far Away.
1	"What kids will get from it is plenty of fairly outrageous but not often witty fun with fairytale elements blended into a kind of latterday spaghetti western. For the rest of us, there is plenty of nice visual detail."
1	Genuinely funny but amateurishly constructed.
0	
0	"Does the thought of watching grown men act like socially awkward boy wonders, while everyone tries not to look confused at their golly-gee shenanigans, crack you up?"
0	"Not surprisingly, especially for a movie heavy on college humor, the results are hit-and-miss. Some bits fall thuddingly flat, and the characters are rarely more than stick figures."
1	"Smutty, silly, groan-worthy in many places, inexplicably hilarious in others, Mystery Team is a guilty pleasure -- a deeply dumb movie made by pretty smart people."
1	"A pleasant, charming knockabout with a playfully imaginative sense of wit and a pleasingly assured visual style."
0	Not so much a Big Chill knockoff as a poor man's Whit Stillman comedy.
0	"Since no one in the cast is a household name, the series of confessions and critiques resemble nothing so much as actors' auditions."
0	"No one's problems inspire much interest, and the stuffy banality of the dialogue is multiplied by the lackluster surroundings."
0	"A drearily pretentious, ultra-stagy exercise in middle-age self-loathing."
0	"A respectable B-list cast (Cynthia Stevenson, Jessica Hecht, Christopher McDonald) wades through a sludgy script that finds estranged friends reuniting decades after college."
0	This may not be quite the moment to solicit our sympathy for self-absorbed beneficiaries of Ivy League privilege.
0	"It's a wonder a group of experienced film professionals could not make ""Reunion"" look and sound the least bit proficient or even entertaining"
1	
0	Pushes the eccentric without creating believable characters.
1	"Overall an emotionally rich and tender film, beautifully played, with heart and head in massive abundance."
1	"It's charming in a proper way, entirely avoiding sentiment and can be counted one of the best films in town."
1	"Lots of bruised humour, quiet virtuosity - watch for the slow-motion montage of disaster - and doggy-eyed optimism."
0	"Full of folksy humour but next to no urgency, it's a strangely exasperating slice of humdrum world cinema."
1	This is a heartfelt and deadpan portrait of the knife-edge poverty of people who are not so much greedy as desperate.
0	"Beto as a character is problematic - one minute hes a twinkly, moustachiod dreamer hoping for a better life; the next he's a macho bully who shoves his cowering wife around their shack. The film requires that we focus on the former and forgive the latter."
1	"The Pope's Toilet excels most in its expression of a particular time and place, which Charlone films with the kind of physical intensity and realism associated with recent Argentine cinema."
0	"The movie isn't as bad as I feared, but I can't give it much of an endorsement, either."
1	"Watch it now, and you'll be surprised how such a little movie can cut so deeply to the bone."
1	The Pope's Toilet cloaks religious critique in the scrappy tempo of irremediable poverty and irrepressible enterprise.
1	"The Pope's Toilet entertains, even while it illustrates how the impoverished can adjust their religious ideals out of desperation."
1	"The cast of pros and amateurs provides realistic performances, and co-director Charlone's lensing makes beautiful use of the rough landscape in a movie even the pope would enjoy."
1	The teen vampire series finally hits its stride with an entertaining mix of romance and action fantasy.
1	The pleasant surprise this time around is that the result finally feels more like the blockbuster this top-earning franchise deserves.
0	"Viewers who value the little things, such as passable acting and dialogue not stolen from a sixth-grader's diary, will once again walk away dazed, dumbfounded and partially deaf from all the surrounding squealing."
1	"If Slade doesn't necessarily advance the medium with this installment, he nonetheless advances the franchise, with enough lucidity and skill that he's persuaded at least one erstwhile agnostic to take a stand."
0	Anyone walking into Eclipse without seeing the previous two movies would be genuinely perplexed; behavior that barely makes sense when you know the story becomes truly nutty without context.
0	"Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay (like her scripts for the first two installments) is faithful enough to Meyer's soap-operatic inclinations, but I kind of wish she weren't. I kind of wish Bella weren't such an indecisive wuss about her feelings."
0	"With roughly 20 minutes of its two-hour running time devoted to characters doing something besides alternately moping and declaring their eternal love for each other, Eclipse stands as the most action-packed entry yet."
1	"Has its cheesecake and eats it, too. It's heavy on topless shots of barely legal Taylor Lautner, but now Pattinson grumbles, ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"""
0	The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is just one more walk on the mild sides for tweens who dream of being penetrated by cold flesh that will keep them young and cute forever.
1	A more robustly entertaining film than either of its predecessors.
1	"The kiss of the vampire is cooler, the werewolf is hotter, the battles are bigger and the choices are, as everyone with a pulse (and a few without) knows by now, life-changing."
1	When you see love represented on film in such an authentic and genuine manner it's easy to find yourself in a forgiving mood.
1	Slade skips the stultifying slow-motion fantasy sequences that so weighed down New Moon in favor of a well-paced blend of action and introspection.
0	Why the bloodsucker and the wolf boy treat Bella as if she's the cat's meow is still a mystery.
0	"Eclipse suffers from an excess of characters and dialogue and a shortage of real plot changes, even with Hard Candy's sharp-eyed David Slade at the helm."
1	"What elevates Eclipse above the previous Twilight films is that it doesn't take itself so seriously, and Slade doesn't allow his stars to."
0	These movies are more about the experience of hearing girls and women who should know better holler at the screen. They could just as well be at a concert.
0	"Easily the least compelling, least fun entry in the saga thus far."
1	"If you adore Meyer's characters already, you'll be thrilled to spend more time with them. If you don't, well, you'd just end up sitting among a bunch of sighing teens (and their moms), wondering what the fuss is about."
0	"The stars remain a boring threesome, Stewart limping through supposedly impassioned speeches as though Bella already were one of the cold-blooded undead."
1	"This is the first Twilight film that feels like a real movie in its own right, not just a spin-off from a mass literary cult."
0	"Eclipse, like its two predecessors, is ham-fisted and obvious, a mass-market entertainment with a frustrating lack of imagination, anemic plotting (how were those novels so fat?) and no aspirations toward anything greater than box office ka-ching."
0	"More happens in Eclipse than in the previous Twilight zone, New Moon, and yet it's duller."
1	"The Twilight Saga comes close to that sweet spot between swooning silliness and special effects slaughter with Eclipse, the third film in the series."
0	This third go-round won't make Twihard converts of the rest of us.
0	"For most of its languorous running time, it listens to conversations between Bella and Edward, Bella and Jacob, Edward and Jacob, and Edward and Bella and Jacob. This would play better if any of them were clever conversationalists."
1	Eclipse's balance of PG-13 romance and bone-crunching action will satisfy Twi-Hards and appeal to supernatural romantics who haven't completely converted to TV's True Blood.
0	"As always, the biggest screams emanating from the audience come when Lautner bares his chest."
1	"The choice of whether to see Eclipse isn't really a question of whether the movie is good or bad. It's a question of whether or not the movie speaks to your secret, unregulated, inherently ridiculous experience of identification and desire."
1	The intensity is sustained and passionate. It's the glue that holds the glop together.
1	"David Slade goes for more of everything: action, violence and unrequited sexual tension."
1	Director David Slade keeps the action brisk and the time-killing attractive ... All of which should be like a freshly opened vein for fans.
1	"While the new Eclipse remains foremost a flick for devotees, it has sturdier pleasures and takes on its emotional ambitions with renewed dedication."
0	"Kristin Stewart, an actress who shows amazing range and ability when not playing Bella, continues to do her best imitation of a cardboard cutout here."
1	"The third chapter in Bella Swan's via dolorosa is still pretty much of a drag for anyone not affiliated with Teams Edward and Jacob, but it certainly eclipses the dead-on-arrival dud that was New Moon."
0	This is definitely the worst installment of the franchise to date.
1	"Eclipse is the least laughable installment yet in the series, and director David Slade efficiently delivers the fan service that Twihards require."
1	"The first two movies were mediocre, but ""Eclipse"" represents one of the more astonishing upgrades in movie franchise history."
1	"Although Eclipse isn't a great film on its own, it's pretty much the Twilight movie fans have been waiting for."
1	"It appears to have embraced its own sense of camp and is consistently funny in an intentional way. For the first time, I found myself curious to see what comes next."
1	"If New Moon had no story to speak of, Eclipse almost has too much. It's a much better problem to have."
1	"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse dispenses with much of the caramel gooeyness of the first two episodes in favor of decent action, some heartfelt tender moments and even a splash of wit. This time they're actually Twi-ing."
1	"The movie is about a girl's primal dream of being desired. That may well be corny, but it's also an essential antidote to summer-movie hardware."
1	"In a universe where almost all CGI-laden, blood-spilling tentpole movies are aimed at ensnaring the teenage male, there's something to be said for a series of films aimed squarely -- and successfully -- at teenage girls."
1	"I can't pretend that the third episode instilled a fever in my blood, but it didn't leave me cold. For the first time in the series I felt I'd seen a real movie."
0	"In a rare moment of insight, the teenage but immortal vampires in The Twilight Saga: Eclipse complain about being ""frozen"" in their lives, unable to ""move forward."" So is everyone involved in this deathtrap of a franchise."
1	"When it comes to the things this brand is famous for -- angsty canoodling, ethereal rocking out, truckloads of male beauty, Duran Duran-style make-up and culturally savvy jokes -- Eclipse actually goes one better than the last offering."
1	"It's easy to knock the Twilightfilms, with their taste for cheesy special effects and teenage hyper-ventilation, but the feelings that course through them are honest enough -- just your average old-fashioned romantic-masochistic teen-dream rapture."
0	The biggest problem remains the characters: neither Slade nor Stewart are capable of turning manipulative whinger Bella into anything more than a joyless black hole sucking the life from every scene.
1	"All three actors are comfortable with their characters, and Slade finds the right balance of action and romance; the story feels organic. Some of the dialogue is earnest and silly, but the core strength of the Stephenie Meyer novels is here: the battle be"
0	"""All I want is your protection,"" he says to Bella, firmly removing her hand from inside his shirt. ""I'll protect you no matter what."" Edward Cullen: the human condom."
0	"What began as an enjoyably perverse fable of teen romance and chastity has dwindled, by this third instalment, into a sorry, soppy saga."
0	The trouble is that Antichrist feels progressively symptomatic of a director losing heart.
1	This is cinema at its most extreme and mind-boggling.
1	A troubling but refreshing sense of an artist uncloaked. A violent conflict of ideas and images. Any satisfaction from loose ends tied and questions answered? Forget it. It's just not that sort of film.
0	"Given how desperate to shock the film is, it's surprising that long swathes of it are so turgidly dull."
0	"It's one good-looking, publicity-grabbing provocation, with an overlay of pseudo-Christian allegory thrown in to deflect a reasonable person's accusations of misogyny."
1	"While there's no doubt that the place he goes is off a precipitous edge, one can't deny the film's continuing primal power."
1	"Visually gorgeous to a fault and teeming with grandiose if often fascinating ideas that overwhelm the modest story that serves as their vehicle, this may be the least artistically successful film von Trier has ever made."
0	"Lars von Trier cuts a big fat art-film fart with ""Antichrist."" As if deliberately courting critical abuse, the Danish bad boy densely packs this theological-psychological horror opus with grotesque, self-consciously provocative images."
0	"Antichrist, which, above all, wants to make pain visceral, is less successful at projecting authentic experience -- the shock tactics are ultimately numbing."
1	"We can scoff and dismiss it as the last gasp ravings of a deranged opportunist. Or we can look, unflinchingly, at Von Trier's fantastically painful mirror and acknowledge the Id within us all. Now that is scary."
0	"Antichrist is a smirking contraption of a film, a cheeky, nasty, clever device for making us upset about the dead kid, making us scared at the creepy happenings, making us freaked out at the violence, and finally making us convulsed with liberal outrage."
1	"It's thrilling to see that von Trier's vicious sense of mischief, his moviemaking skill and his desire to smash limits and expectations all remain undimmed. However you swallow it, this bizarre, hysterical melodrama is impossible to ignore."
1	"Antichrist is a fairground ride through the brain of a genius, both nightmarish and apocalyptic. Trier's head is the most dangerous place in modern cinema, its multiple caverns mysteriously structured and weirdly laid out."
0	It's so outlandish that at times you wonder if Von Trier himself knows what's going on. It would not be surprising to learn that he's making it all up as he goes along.
0	"The film can expose you to nothing about life, nothing about film, while telling you more than you ever wanted to know about the director's malicious vanity."
0	"Von Trier has mutilated his own film, turning it into a crazy, hysterical work that alienates the audience with its infantile shock tactics and tedious transgressions."
0	"Von Trier says he was suffering from severe bouts of depression when he shot the movie. See Antichrist, and you'll know the feeling."
1	"A word to the squeamish: there is no shame in leaving as the tools-and I use the word advisedly-come out. In a way, you will be getting the best of Antichrist, which until now has been a film of awkwardness, confusion, and great beauty."
1	"It offers more proof, if we need any, that von Trier is one of the most accomplished cinema artists of our time, and also perhaps the most deeply trapped in his own head."
0	To say that Antichrist is shocking would suggest that it's effective.
0	The impotent folly of Antichrist is that von Trier has made it his mission to shock the bourgeoisie in an era when they can no longer be shocked.
0	"This is a classic case of a filmmaker believing he has found a greater truth and attempting with only middling success to regurgitate it in a film. And, like all vomit, you can kind-of see what it's composed of but the smell drives you away."
1	I can't deny this is filled with powerfully primal images.
1	"By turns repellent, powerful and ludicrous, Antichrist piles horror on horror with pitiless passion."
0	"After the infantile bludgeoning that is Antichrist), I feel no need to keep accompanying von Trier's career at all."
1	I'm inclined to agree with a colleague who told me he could swing with Antichrist when it was simply unstable but couldn't go with it when it turned insane. It's a useful distinction. And yet the first hour...is pretty stunning.
0	"The movie immerses itself in the darkest despair imaginable, blending dystopian porn with ghastly horror and graphic violence. But it's all done in a mundane, almost clinical way."
1	"For better and for worse, it is exactly the movie von Trier wanted to make and a piece of staggeringly pure cinema. On at least one level, it's also hateful."
1	"Von Trier, who has always been a provocateur, is driven to confront and shake his audience more than any other serious filmmaker -- even Bunuel and Herzog."
0	Artfully horrific but artificial and soulless.
0	"The scandal of Antichrist is not that it is grisly or upsetting but that it is so ponderous, so conceptually thin and so dull."
1	"Please don't take anything I've said to indicate that Antichrist isn't difficult to watch. It most certainly is, but as somebody (the Marquis de Sade, perhaps) once said: No pain, no gain."
0	"Though it's hard to deny the fierce purity of Gainsbourg's performance, Antichrist plays like an incoherent mix of Gothic horror claptrap and Bergmanesque power struggle. I was more bored and puzzled than shattered and provoked."
0	"The movie's story and meaning are not mysterious but deliberately impenetrable, faint gestures in all directions, absent of artistic integrity, intellectual rigor or emotional significance."
0	"Allegorical in the worst ways, Antichrist is about as profound as a slasher movie."
0	"On a narrative level, it's gobbledygook, as if von Trier has dredged up the details of a nightmare and filmed them in an attempt to get at some primal truths."
0	"Von Trier has said he wanted to make a genre horror picture, but he couldn't even come up with a decent metaphor: The climax is out of a Grade C hack-'em-up with people chasing each other through the woods with axes and knives."
1	No doubt some people will find Antichrist repellent. The question is whether you're open to films that are as flawed as they are ambitious.
0	What is Von Trier trying to say?
1	Von Trier and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle use sumptuous black-and-white photography and saturated color. Few movies are as beautifully wrought as this.
1	"Self-loathing, mean, ugly and perfectly made, Antichrist is probably the best film ever that you'd recommend to absolutely no one."
0	"Antichrist ends up being more unnerving than it is terrifying, and a lot funnier than it's supposed to be."
0	"Antichrist is a unique form of cruel and unusual punishment: an unrelenting orgy of graphic sex, violence and cynicism that also manages to be wildly pretentious."
1	"Antichrist is a boldly personal film, tossing all von Trier's ideas about faith, fear, and human nature into an unfettered phantasmagoria, full of repulsive visions and fierce scorn."
1	"Yes, Antichrist is harrowing and often shrill, but the horrors all serve the underlying theme that, try as they might, men can never fully understand the inconsolable grief women endure when they lose a child."
1	"Von Trier, never exactly an optimist, has never been this gloomy and pessimistic. Antichrist is the feel-bad movie of the year."
0	"Of course, von Trier wants us to react, to be repulsed, shocked, offended. Mission accomplished."
0	
0	"It's another tale of an overgrown kid accepted for his sweet, stammering self and nurtured out of his cocoon."
1	"Splinterheads, which aims to be a quirkier Adventureland, never rises above mildly amusing."
0	"For a better courtship story set amongst the world of cotton candy and Tilt-a-Whirls, rent Adventureland instead."
0	Attempts to compensate for its too-familiar romantic setup by defining its characters through idiosyncratic hobbies and traits.
0	"Splinterheads might suffice some late night on cable, but that's about it."
1	A shaggy comedy with more heart than heft.
0	"Not for a single moment does anyone in this film make a good decision. Consequently, you quickly catch on and easily anticipate the bad decisions before they happen."
0	"The pic's attempts at comic portraiture feel sketchy at best, more or less assigning each character a single, belabored trait."
0	Judge's characters are so one-note and their misadventures so ridiculous that it's hard to get attached to them or care about how they turn out.
1	Here for Labor Day -- a comedy about the hilarity and heartbreak of running a small business.
0	"The problem with the film is that, as satires go, this one has blunt teeth. It's funny, but not as funny as it should be."
0	"Didn't Judge realize that Extract, with its plastic setups and one-dimensional harpies, plays like Kevin Smith remaking a bad George Segal comedy from 1978?"
1	"A curious combination of workplace comedy and midlife crisis, it's not as good as [Judge's] best work -- the characters are too one-dimensional -- but the laughs are generous and genuine."
1	"Extract is a real tour de force for Bateman, who finally has a big-screen role that plays to his Arrested Development strength -- a guy dismayed at how moronic those around him can be."
1	"Like Judge's first two live-action films, Extract seems destined to do minor business at the box office but achieve a kind of immortality as a cult DVD."
1	"Judge's gifts parallel those of his leading man. His plotting is full of funny, unpredictable moments but lacks the grating hysteria of the comic genre."
0	"Mr. Judge has done better, more pointed work before, notably in the cult-favorite workplace comedy Office Space."
1	"A little morally perverse under the surface, as Bateman learns that one of the keys to happiness is an attitude of ""Let them eat cherry-flavored cake."""
0	"While Extract is mildly amusing and a slice of a mostly working-class world that doesn't make it into comedy that much anymore, it's not completely convincing as a movie."
1	"Fitfully funny with a low joke-to-minute ratio, Extract plays like two irreconcilable and unfinished sketches, neither particularly fertile comedic terrain."
0	"Extract has its moments, but not enough of them. Think I'll go ahead and watch Office Space again."
1	"Judge may not have the workplace comedy down as smoothly as, say, Judd Apatow does with relationship comedies, but he has an ear for comical dialogue and an eye for a top-notch ensemble cast."
0	"Extract may be the most disappointing American comedy of the decade, partly because it's jokeless and joyless but mostly because it squanders an all-star cast of superb comic talent."
1	Mike Judge has become our most dogged examiner of middle-American foolishness; no other comedy filmmaker more skillfully exploits that nagging sense that you're surrounded by idiots.
0	"A mix of coolheaded cultural satire and anxiety-inducing workplace and marital shenanigans, Extract is an odd project. It's smarter than most of the comedies out there right now, but that doesn't necessarily make it funnier."
0	"There's classic screwball comedy lurking in this material, a cynic's recognition that the world runs crookedly. But the movie is logy and repetitive."
1	"Ten years after Office Space flopped in theaters, only to find the passionate following it deserved down the line, Extract finds Judge returning triumphantly to the workplace comedy."
1	"Some will find Judge's politics liberal; some will suggest they're conservative; I would simply say that they're American, in the best possible sense of the word, and Frank Capra might have found a lot to admire in ""Extract,"" even with the d--- jokes."
0	"That has the makings of a deliciously dark comedy, but Judge lets the premise simply drift away like a pothead's train of thought."
1	"Mike Judge's Extract has some huge belly laughs, a terrific ensemble cast and more than a few instances of inspired comic brilliance. So why doesn't the movie ever really take off?"
0	A comedy need not be believable. But it needs to seem as if it's believable at least to itself.
1	"The entire cast, in fact, seems to be having fun, with Affleck and Koechner cheerfully stealing each one of their scenes."
1	There are some priceless character turns.
1	It has all the ingredients for cult immortality and will likely live on long after this year's Oscar winners are forgotten.
1	"These days, it appears to be a rare gift to do comedy in a way that comes across as smart, but never superior or willfully crass. Bateman has that talent to spare."
1	"Mike Judge's Extract -- modest, no big deal but very savvy -- is the funniest American comedy of the summer."
1	"The result doesn't seem as fresh as Office Space, but Judge still comes up with enough laughs to deserve our attention."
0	"[Extract] resembles its titular foodstuffs: less a fully realized comedy than the distillation of one. The ingredients are there, and the recipe as well, but Judge evidently forgot that the whole dish still needed cooking."
0	"A ""sympathy for the boss"" comedy could conceivably work, but Judge has neglected to supply the laughs this time around."
1	"This isn't a misanthropic picture; its true subject is the way love for our fellow human beings is so often thwarted by their actual behavior -- and still, stupidly perhaps, we just won't give up on them."
1	"Extract isn't an instant classic, but it bumps along agreeably, its humor culled from serial bad decisions, mock-romantic discontent and lots of spirited overacting ripe with good intentions."
1	"Right in time for the economic downturn comes Extract, a smart and potently funny workplace comedy about running a small business just as small businesses get routinely run into the ground."
0	Mocking an officious middle-manager is always fair game; ridiculing blue-collar workers who resent their mindless jobs just feels mean.
0	
1	There are so many good jokes packed in there.
0	"Has many promising ingredients, yet somehow none of them quite gel."
0	"Judge knows his game well enough, but too often the jokes feel like seasoning to a premise that is just slightly overdone."
1	
1	
0	"What a mistake. Extract is awful. Intended as a light, soft-porno-motivated film, it turned out to be crude and with little humor."
0	"The remake ups the adrenaline factor, and features strong perfs across the board, yet feels bogged down by a weighty love triangle and a subject that merits more than the old-school good vs. evil approach."
1	"As a thriller, The Debt performs many if not all the right moves. The suspense builds nicely, the twists come as surprises and its key characters are vivid enough."
0	The moral has the force of a scolding rather than of a galvanic lived experience.
1	"Predictably, the holes in the narrative set us up for a twist or three, but, in balance, it's a pleasure to be back in the wet alleys and spy-patrolled streets of the GDR, however vague they seem without '60s black-and-white cinematography."
1	"Madden's dark, moody, complex exploration of guilt and identity taps into a rich vein of moral ambiguity..."
1	"""The Debt"" eventually settles into a predictable groove that slightly undercuts its impact. Still, it's a film of ambition and substance."
1	"Relentlessly paced and artfully lensed and constructed, it's a first-rate thriller that explores loyalty, duty to country and self, and the price of deception with skill and razor-sharp precision."
1	"What the three pairs of actors lack in semblance (or resemblance), they make up for to a great extent in their performances."
1	"The Debt functions both as an edge-of-the-seat thriller and an effective drama about the sometimes passionate, sometimes contentious relationships among the three main characters."
1	Put Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson together in a movie and chances are you're not going to be disappointed.
1	"As it jumps back and forth in time, ""The Debt"" explores the conflict between expectations and reality, intellect and emotions, truth and regret."
1	"The film's a potboiler but a gripping one, and it leaves you chewing on both its nuances and implausibilities."
1	"It probes, with perhaps more energy than clarity, the ethical and psychological complications that can lie hidden beneath a story of simple heroism."
1	"Madden's version maintains all the literal and figurative scars left on these characters, but everything here is made at least one degree more obvious, even as the screenplay tries mightily to hide its secrets."
1	"A Nazi-hunting thriller deepens into a meditation on conscience in The Debt, a movie that holds you in its grip."
1	"The Debt poses an arresting question: In a place that's as haunted by history as Israel is, can a lie ever really serve to prop up a larger truth?"
0	The cast does what it can in the service of this assignment. But some jobs simply resist satisfying completion.
1	It's a wakeup face slap for a medium that has spent too many warm-weather nights dreaming of superheroes and frat boys.
0	Solemnly tony Oscar bait.
1	"An excellent international spy thriller, wrapped up in an only-fair mystery."
1	The film analyzes the implications of heroism and its burdensome weight. It also explores the haunting toll that comes with burying the truth.
1	"Bristling with dangers both corporeal and cerebral, ""The Debt"" is a superbly crafted espionage thriller packed with Israeli-Nazi score settling."
1	"It is an exciting movie, full of crises and dramatic turns despite an aura of sadness that seems to pervade it."
0	"The architecture of ""The Debt"" has an unfortunate flaw. The younger versions of the characters have scenes that are intrinsically more exciting, but the actors playing the older versions are more interesting."
1	"Vogel is a genuinely chilling villain, and there are some deeply unsettling scenes between him and his captors."
0	"Rather than focus on the evil of the Nazi villain, it wallows in the collective regret of three Israeli Mossad agents who in 1966 let the bad guy slip away when they had him in their clutches."
0	There are movies you want to like that just won't let you.
0	"The direction and performances remain as solid as ever, but they're both growing obscured by the top-heavy plot."
1	"The Debt has the overall air of an Oscar contender that never got into the ring -- well-made, but not spectacular. Still, it serves as a fine, full introduction to Chastain's potential."
1	The Debt roots itself in reality more plausibly than most contemporary spy films without sacrificing the genre's tense thrills.
0	"The movie drowns the deeper questions it raises in a sadistic procedural, an endless circular motion of fight scenes whose only justification is themselves."
0	A strong cast fails to rescue this ponderous Oscar bait.
1	The thrills work out better than the smarts.
1	Helen Mirren pulls off the impressive trick of dominating the movie even while she's absent for huge chunks of its running time.
0	"Awkwardly marrying ""Munich""-style moral conundrums with cheesy Robert Ludlum stylings, the slow-paced thriller ""The Debt"" never pays off."
1	"Vogel's introduction, 'This is my hand, and this is the speculum,' may at last have displaced the 'Is it safe?' of Christian Szell--another Mengele stand-in--as the most discomfiting sentence ever uttered by doctor to patient onscreen."
1	"Worthington shows a greater range and vulnerability here than he did in either Avatar or Clash of the Titans, where he mostly just flexed his pecs. He may be a genuine movie star yet."
1	"After a gripping first half, turns into one howler after another. And yet it's still gripping."
0	"There is an awkward, irresoluble tension between the movie's urge to thrill and the weighty pull of the historical obligations that it seeks to assume. How much, to be blunt, should we be enjoying ourselves?"
1	"'The Debt' tackles themes of humanity, revenge and truth so successfully it's hard not to find it powerful - even if it's not the Oscar bait it might have hoped to be."
1	"Solid, workmanlike storytelling is what's on offer in this meaty thriller with robust and satisfying star turns..."
1	"There's the overall feeling of hard work not quite paying off, but the gorgeous and game Chastain quietly salvages everything she can."
0	"John Shakespeare In Love Madden directs, but literary larks in the Globe are a long way from the laboured, catchpenny lucubrations of this global retribution tale."
0	Vaughn and Goldman chose the wrong vehicle.
1	"The performances are what counts, and Mirren and Chastain certainly deliver."
1	"The film is rigorously streamlined to deliver a good emotional uppercut by the end, and purely on the strength of its craft, it connects."
1	Everybody's Fine is a fitting title. The movie may well be fine. But it could have been a lot better.
0	"Everyone works well under the perfunctory direction of Kirk Jones, but even with an easily resolved fade-out replete with turkey and cranberry sauce, Everybody's Fine has the look and taste of leftovers."
0	"Written and directed by British director Kirk Jones with guidance, apparently, from Dr. Phil..."
1	A tolerably sober alternative to holiday froth at the mutliplex.
1	"De Niro offers a master class of mannered, minimalist acting."
0	It's all so much raging bull.
1	"Another actor might have greedily milked the story's pathos quotient (believe me, there are plenty of opportunities). But De Niro hangs back, and the approach works."
1	"Ultimately, Everybody's Fine becomes a holiday movie of rare sweetness; one likely to inspire a few calls home to Mom or Dad."
1	"De Niro plays his character completely contained, afraid to brim or overflow with emotion. The more he pulls back, the more he pulls in the audience."
0	It takes some effort to neutralize the charm of a modestly charismatic Robert De Niro performance. But Everybody's Fine does a stupendous job.
0	"Even more than the remake that it is, Everybody's Fine plays like a homogenized, Hallmark Channel version of About Schmidt, with all the rough edges shaved off."
1	What's finest about Everybody's Fine is to watch a good fella groping hopefully toward old age.
0	"A thoroughly fake movie with trite characters that is about, of all things, the need for truthfulness."
1	"It's a relief to see Robert De Niro giving an honest, effective starring performance in a project that does not stink and that, in fact, rises to a respectable level of filmmaking proficiency. How long has it been?"
0	"All that could redeem this thoroughly foreseeable unfolding would be colorful characters and good acting. Everybody's Fine comes close, but not close enough."
0	"Promising start, but it unravels with an ill-advised confrontation scene and an ending that rings false."
0	"If nothing else (and there ain't much else), Everybody's Fine does prove one thing: Even an actor with the gifts of Robert De Niro can't make bland interesting."
0	"There's no challenge to this material, no real emotional pull, it's one of those films that simply rolls by until its right-from-the-beginning predictable ending."
1	This is sentimental but dramatically solid.
0	False to the core.
0	No feel-bad-feel-good film should be this chilly.
0	"Though De Niro gives a strong performance as a loving, if not always perceptive, dad, the film takes a treacly turn, grows truly sad and never fully recovers."
1	Everybody's Fine -- a more subtle film than its advertising indicates -- works because it has a feel for little things.
1	"Expect an uncomfortable moment while watching Everybody's Fine. You're not the only one who edits events and polishes the truth to protect your parents -- and yourself. Worse, they know it."
1	Let the sentiment reveal itself. Don't veer into sentimentality. Don't push. Just trust the story. That's the whole trick with a movie like Everybody's Fine.
1	The movie works because so much of what's on screen will resonate with viewers.
1	Everybody should see Everybody's Fine. But one piece of advice: Phone home first.
0	"I didn't feel like I was watching characters who were related to each other. Every scene they are in, I felt like I was watching movie stars meeting each other for the first time."
1	"Is it anything special? No, not really. But it's an agreeable and even touching little snapshot of family life."
0	Forget Hollywood remakes; this is one film I(TM)d like to see reworked by an arthouse director and a pack of actors with smaller names and bigger reserves of subtlety.
0	"It(TM)s a little like About Schmidt - the sly wit, subtlety and directorial flair."
1	"A refreshingly open, untricksy performance from De Niro, and very possibly the harbinger of an excellent late period for him as an actor. As for the film, well ""fine"" is what can reasonably be said."
1	Its essential niceness should not be discounted; niceness is a rare commodity in films today.
0	"It(TM)s a four-square set-up, but with only the barest flicker of familial friction heating the undercooked drama."
0	"De Niro alone is worth watching, even if one suspects the pain on his face comes from the script he must speak rather than the story he must enact."
0	"De Niro, while initially expressionless, gives the film a heart. Barrymore and Beckinsale stay one-dimensionally cute. A weepie that wholly fails to make you weep."
0	"It's mushy, fake and full of hopelessly silly feelgood sentiment. Nobody could transcend this, not even De Niro - nor Sam Rockwell, the best of the supporting players."

1	"Tastefully provocative, ultimately haunting."
0	"The real question, is who cares?"
0	"A kinder, chicer Adrian Lyne movie."
0	"Here, as in a cosmetics ad, the performers are assigned to telegraph desire as characters defined by visual stereotype, their empty chatter decorated with facile metaphors."
1	"The will-they-or-won't-they structure is a bit facile, but Last Night is on to something fascinating."
1	"It's a quiet, contemplative film that reminded me of Mike Nichols' Closer, with too many shots of lighting cigarettes and looking pensive in train windows, but I liked it."
0	"He's withheld and she's, frankly, grating. So we don't really care if they weather the current storm, because sooner or later they're bound to get divorced, anyway."
0	It's hard to care about the fate of a marriage that never quite comes into focus.
0	Will Michael succumb and prove Joanna correct in her suspicions? Will Alex's French accent conquer all? Do you care? I didn't.
1	"Massy Tadjedin's intimate directorial debut takes a spare, thoughtful approach to relationships."
1	Tadjedin shows an intimate understanding of how couples communicate through ellipses and of all that remains unsaid even amid torrents of angry words.
0	"Suspenseful though it is, the movie is quiet to the point of being sleepy, and Worthington is simply not working out as a screen star."
0	"It's the sort of movie that thinks cutting between two different stories makes it art. Usually, it feels like an exercise in art. There's a lot of calisthenics but very little beauty or truth or whatever it is the movie is going for."
1	"Tadjedin banks on the power of telling, familiar moments, betting that viewers will recognize the heartache at the center of a fleeting expression or hurried action. For the most part, her gamble pays off."
0	Forget about sex or adultery -- there isn't enough life in Last Night.
0	"'Last Night' is an empty exercise in sheer self-regard, a tedious, lifeless trawl through the secret lives of the rich and beautiful."
1	"A good-looking, tightly-scripted and ever-so-slightly superficial drama about a married couple on the brink of infidelity."
1	"A small-scale, indulgent but worthwhile movie from writer-director Massy Tadjedin about infidelity, jealousy and the quarter-life crisis."
0	"Leaves you to fill in the gaps, but you won't care enough to bother."
1	"The word sexy is horribly overused. When it comes to this pair, though, it's the only word that will do."
0	"It's quite enjoyable, and the ending is very good -- I just didn't believe a moment of it."
1	"The film is as shiny and thin as a coat of nail varnish, but beguilingly photographed..."
1	
1	The filmmakers don't get everything right but their passion for Ginsberg's genius and their excitement over trying to deconstruction a literary master work is contagious. A more perfect film might have been just a teensy-weensy dull.
0	"Milk meets Pink Floyd the Wall. Says everything it has to say in the first 20 minutes, then keeps repeating itself."
0	"It's done pretty well as a poem up till now, and more than once during Franco's reading, I simply closed my eyes and listened."
1	"Howl is very, very, good. Worth seeing if you love writing, if you've ever written, if you're intrigued by the creative process as a whole."
0	"Splendid as Franco's literal characterization and overheated line readings can be, art director Eric Drooker's literal-minded animated interpretation of ""Howl"" are as sodden as a cold latke -- as well as a distraction."
1	"Allen Ginsberg's revolutionary 1956 poem ''Howl'' -- a literary manifesto for the Beat Generation -- gets a great reading from modern-day beatnik-star James Franco, playing the poet with bebop passion."
0	"There is no defining story of lasting importance here, so the directors opted for a small narrative, a lot of drawings and snippets of the trial. It's filled with graphics, but doesn't really amount to much of a film or an illumination of the man's life."
0	A Beat Generation biopic that makes you sympathize with the Man? That's just unholy.
0	"A film of passion and ambition, but one whose success is intermittent at best."
1	"Happily, Ginsberg's words still cut recklessly through the years."
1	"By the time this movie's over, you've spent an hour and a half just working your way through the words of ""Howl"" and some related source material, and that turns out to be a surprisingly satisfying thing to do."
1	"An exemplary work of literary criticism on film, explaining and contextualizing its source without deadening it."
1	Howl is a movie with no clear narrative. It pushes boundaries and feels like one man's fever dream. But all those traits would certainly make Allen Ginsberg happy.
0	"How do you make poetry cinematic? ""Howl,'' a new film about beat writer Allen Ginsberg, asks that question without realizing the question is backward. It should be: How do you make cinema poetic?"
0	"It's well-crafted, but I wish the film showed us an additional dimension or two of the central figure, who once said the great challenge in writing, any kind of writing, is ""to write the same way you are."""
1	"The bold, outspoken man of later days is seen here as still a middle-class youth, uncertain of his gayness, filled with the heady joy of early poetic success, learning how to be himself."
1	"The language of that poem, which periodically pours out from the screen, is the best thing in the movie."
1	"The result, though clearly flawed, is passionate and ambitious, celebrating that long-gone era when a book of verse could spark a revolution in consciousness."
0	The best thing about the film Howl is the poem Howl.
0	"Despite James Franco's smart performance as poet Allen Ginsberg, this film rings hollow."
1	"The film forces us to face what a powerful poem ""Howl"" remains. That poetry isn't just pretty language, it has the ability to make us think about our lives, even to change our lives."
0	"Howl is a disappointingly mundane movie about a vibrant, iconoclastic subject."
1	"It's about literature itself, the ways in which it works on the reader and the folly of applying some objective standard of decency and meaning to words on a page."
1	"Epstein and Friedman didn't write the film as much as assemble it, using actual interview quotes and court transcripts. And while the loose structure takes some getting used to, it's ultimately effective and at times thrilling."
1	What could have been a trivial exercise in nostalgia instead becomes a powerful case for the cathartic power of art.
0	Admirable if fundamentally academic.
1	"It's sweet stuff, a portrait of an artist in turmoil, under fire and laying himself bare. Howl captures Howl beautifully."
1	"Is it watchable? Yes. Mainly for Franco's gamy Ginsberg, visibly writhing and vocally wrestling to escape the lantern-slide-lecture restrictions of his remit."
1	"This is a bold, inspiring piece of work, putting experimental techniques in the service of a heartfelt, insightful and surprisingly audience-friendly work of art."
1	"A shade of Ginsberg, but a refreshing and solid film."
0	More like a laborious 84-minute trailer.
1	Howl is the American version of The King's Speech.
0	"There are ways to put poetry on the screen, but this drama-documentary about the Beat versifier Allen Ginsberg fails to find them."
0	"Sadly, I found it only moderately enjoyable and rather smug, much like an average edition of the BBC's Arena."
1	It is the trial itself - which Ginsberg did not attend - that is the real payoff here as Howl's defenders and detractors get their day in court.
1	"Great art transcends its creator. In this case, it also lays the foundation for a great film."
1	"Solondz's ongoing interests ... ensure some shocks but his underlying interests are sincere and humane: the consequences of trauma, the capacity for self-delusion, the possibility of change and the necessity of forgiveness."
1	"Todd Solondz, the terminally depressed director of the award-winning Happiness, appears to have cheered up and settled into his role as a kind of super-curdled Woody Allen."
1	"Interesting and bleakly hilarious as it often is, it will add to an uneasy sense that Solondz is running out of ideas."
0	"Just like any family reunion: forced, painful and underwhelming."
1	"If the film says nothing new, it certainly brings the same kick to the mind that Happiness achieved. And it's not as cold-hearted as it first seems."
0	Todd Solondz's Life During Wartime has a mordant humour but lacks a contained focus.
1	"Life During Wartime proves that Solondz, even when he's producing milder fare than when he first came to attention, is still in a league of his own."
1	"A heady mix of deadpan humor that boldly uses such topics as pedophilia, race and terrorism to plead the need for forgiveness at a personal and national level."
1	"Winning result, which reels off one riveting scene after another, stands as both a unique sort-of sequel and a film that requires no prior reference points; it's entirely satisfying either way, though even richer if you recall the antecedent."
1	"Solondz conjures a world that's rotting away from the inside, in which only the children -- freckle-faced Dylan Riley Snyder and Emma Hinz -- weep over the loss of moral authority."
1	"Daring the discomfited viewer to laugh at shame and suffering, and then wonder why we're laughing, Todd Solondz is back."
1	"Solondz may not have softened with age, but his creations have undoubtedly grown wiser because of it."
1	"In a staring contest with his audience, Solondz never blinks. He picks and picks at the themes that consume him, and he doesn't care who stays and who leaves. Me, I'm rapt."
1	Life During Wartime slices deeply into its characters' weaknesses...But also in evidence is an unlikely vein of forgiveness (or maybe it's oblivion).
0	"There's no arc here, no real pathos, and the direction is like watching snow melt on the side of a road."
1	"Solondz sees life as misery and actors as instruments. In his hands, they're pianissimo, vibrato, fortissimo -- and never in harmony."
0	"In retrospect, Todd Solondz probably should have hung it up after Happiness."
0	"There's repetitious talk about forgiving and forgetting, and debate over which is preferable, but Solondz doesn't seem particularly interested in either."
1	"Mr. Solondz exaggerates in the direction of mockery, yes, but his lurid colors, emphatic musical effects and dead-center framing also betray a commitment to melodrama that can only be sincere."
1	"While it obviously isn't for all tastes, this is a big, thematically rich step forward -- mostly it's about tolerance and forgiveness -- from the empty provocation of Solondz's Storytelling and Palindromes. About time."
0	Life During Wartime relies on uncomfortable black humor and moments of sincere drama to involve viewers. But everything is encased in artifice and the movie becomes a chore to take in.
0	I can't stand the moral universe that we're dealing with here.
1	"Not having been a big admirer of Happiness, I don't see the vast achievement in bringing that movie up to date, but a few of the performances and sequences resonate."
1	Derives its blackly comedic bite from being both tragic and immediate.
1	A taut and tantalizing mix of salty bites and lazy blanks...
1	[Solondz'] best to date...
1	"At times, it makes you realize Solondz may be the closest heir we'll get to Robert Bresson, the French filmmaker of human despair and mysterious grace."
0	"Here [Solondz has] made a film that is sad without energy, dead without life. As a sequel to Happiness, it regards the same lives, then as tragedy, now as farce."
0	[Solondz] seems mired in simply rehearsing his characters' most fatal flaws.
1	Todd Solondz keeps attempting the impossible and deserves credit for trying.
1	Lachman and Solondz have a gift for finding the extraordinary in the ordinary and that ray of hope amid the hopelessness.
0	The question is: Who wants to watch these people?
1	"Solondz, through the troubled voice of 13-year-old Timmy, does rigorous justice to the difficulties of forgiving and/or forgetting."
0	"The daring director is still a fascinating craftsman, but now we don't feel welcome in his dollhouse."
1	"For all of Solondz's mischief, we sense he likes his unhelpable characters, and that they maybe like each other. A little bit, anyway."
1	"An easy film to dislike, a piece of cake to admire and all but impossible to love. But I think that's part of the intent."
0	"Life During Wartime, which feels like a movie made to fulfill a contractual obligation, says nothing new, nothing that Happiness didn't already say, only better."
1	"Definitely not a film for everybody, but (Todd) Solondz fans...will find plenty to chew on as he continues his exploration into the wounded lives of three sisters and their fractured families."
0	I'd never have predicted something this mediocre.
1	"Helen may not be for everyone, but to at least some of us, she's irresistible."
1	A daft and insightful look at the gray world between criminal and straight.
1	"Eddie Coyle is made for [Mitchum]: a weary middle-aged man, but tough and proud; a man who has been hurt too often in life not to respect pain; a man who will take chances to protect his own territory."
1	"A good, tough, unsentimental movie about the last days of a small-time Boston hood."
1	The cast lend the film an authority that Yates' curiously pedestrian approach fails to provide.
1	A very fine film about real people on the fringes of both crime and law enforcement.
0	"A mechanical compendium of anti-skepticism clichs, right down to the obligatory post-realization upchuck."
0	Tennyson Bardwell's pretentious psycho-supernatural flick doesn't even qualify as guilty-pleasure camp. It's the sort of bad movie that will make you lose faith in the genre altogether.
0	"Bardwell writes and directs carefully though without inspiration, leaving open the question of whether the house is really haunted."
0	I'll take a bunch of teenagers terrorized by chain-saw-wielding zombies any day.
0	"Old-fashioned in the worst sense, Bardwell's ghost story is heavy on Freud, light on fear."
0	The modestly scaled film delivers some moving and affecting moments amid a preponderance of scenes of frequently annoying people behaving badly.
1	A strong romantic drama in which Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin really shine.
0	More tacky and preposterous than the worst blockbuster phone-in.
0	"A movie with all the hyperventilating hysteria of a 1960s teen-tragedy pop song and all the disposability, too."
1	There's a distinctly bittersweet undertow to the picture that draws you in and helps you overlook the film's weaknesses.
0	"Bless you, R.Patz & Co., because this gloriously steaming pile is officially in the bad-movies-we-love pantheon."
0	"""Remember Me"" is only slightly more than forgettable, but its good intentions and good performances can't make up for a central romance that feels more rushed than real thanks to the triumph of casting and celebrity over chemistry and charm."
1	Remember Me is charged up with stormy melodrama. Pattinson's various fan contingents should eat it up...
0	"When the film finally goes for broke with that ambitious, colossally misconceived finale, a tremendous emotional investment in these characters is necessary to pull it off -- and even then, its prospects would be questionable."
0	"Although clearly it was mapped by a team of consultants, Remember Me is a horrific misstep in the branding of Robert Pattinson."
0	"Allen Coulter directed this morose and sluggish drama, which gets more mileage from Pattinson's anguished profile than from Will Fetters's thunderously overwritten screenplay."
0	"The film's tone is all wrong, the pacing is dead and the veering between sex, sadness and sado-masochistic violence is enough to give you motion sickness. It's a bad movie."
0	"The more you wait for the biggest plot development of the last decade to reduce everybody's problems to a hill of beans, the more Remember Me starts to make you feel cheap."
1	"The fact is, Remember Me is a well-made movie. I cared about the characters. I felt for them."
1	A simple romance for swooners that wins points for noting that two lovers bring with them a clashing mess of family and friends
0	The film gets bogged down by plot points that plod toward an event of devastating proportions.
1	"A small, dense chamber study of unhappy people looking for hope in the darkness, often literally."
0	"There's a sense of construction to Remember Me that undercuts its emotional impact, and emotional impact is pretty much all this film is shooting for."
0	"In Remember Me love means never having to say you're sorry, particularly to the audience."
0	The finale manages to be tasteful and exploitative at the same time. It touts forgiveness while being mildly infuriating. Such is the danger of borrowing from the enormous to merely entertain. If that.
0	"Ambitious but overwrought, with a polarizing final act."
0	"After the first hint of what's coming -- which crops up less than 10 minutes into the movie and then doesn't let up -- the foreshadowing becomes so distracting that, by the time the darn thing goes off, there's only a sense of relief."
0	Time for a quick game of One of These Things Is Not Like the Others: Marlon Brando. James Dean. Robert Pattinson.
0	"Remember Me represents Robert Pattinson's attempt to prove he can do more than sparkle like a faux vampire, but the case he presents is not convincing."
0	"It's all weepy drool until the twist ending, which turns it shockingly offensive."
0	"If Remember Me is remembered for anything at all, other than being yet another Robert Pattinson vehicle, it will be for its over-the-top ending, which ranks high amongst the most shameless jerkers of tears ever unleashed upon lachrymose teens."
0	There's no shame in exploring tragedy through art. But exploiting it to make your very ordinary movie feel more important? That's another story.
0	Somewhere the heart that must anchor a romantic drama has gone missing. We don't so much feel the relationships as see them.
0	"So many terrible things happen to the people in Allen Coulter's Remember Me that when the last awful twist comes -- something so resounding and meaningful that it instantly, horribly cheapens the rest of the movie -- you're almost numb to it."
1	"Remember Me is a touching love story, but its broader tale of familial relations packs a greater emotional punch."
1	"Pattinson's hero is well drawn, emerging as yet another descendent of Holden Caulfield."
0	[Pattinson is] like Luke Perry doing James Dean in the dreariest John Hughes movie ever made: Some Kind of Terrible.
0	"Robert Pattinson's hair will get the teens in for this mopey New York romance, but goodness, do they have a shock in store."
1	There are no less than four tremendous performances in the film.
0	"If this movie is playing at a theatre near you, you might want to consider moving somewhere else."
0	"The drama -- a far cry from the vampire stories of Twilight -- allows Pattinson to show broader emotional range. But the script is rife with clichs, and the sex is so artily lit it seems direct from cable."
0	"Be warned, if you're vulnerable to outrageous, cringe-inducing implausibilities -- not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latter's Twin Towers boardroom -- you'd best give this one a miss."
0	"Decently shot and directed as it is, it lacks any real flame."
1	"Remember Me provides some mild domestic spats and lots of picturesque male brooding, but it's a pallid and oddly exploitative affair."
0	"Tween and teen girls will weep in the cheap seats, while adults will be narked by the ending, a shameful piggyback on a national tragedy, which will further the career of the heart-throb."
0	"Put it this way, Coulter, there are over 3000 true stories you could have told, and this film may insult every single one."
1	"Overwritten and overcooked, Remember Me still manages a few explosive sequences between Pattinson and Pierce Brosnan."
0	"Sounds Disneyfied enough on paper, but the elderly, violin-toting hero's successful attempt to infiltrate his miscreant nephew's mall-punk garage band is too creepy to fulfill the hipness quotient."
1	Uncle Nino is strictly straightforward and utterly conventional yet has been made with the kind of caring and commitment that will connect with many viewers.
0	"A creaky, cliched, feel-good family drama about learning to stop and smell the roses - and planting a vegetable garden while you're at it -- Uncle Nino is shameless, sappy fare."
0	"It's all neat and sweet and one-dimensional, more the moral to a story than a story."
1	An effortless heartwarmer that manages to be utterly corny but quite likable.
0	"This is not my kind of movie, and I found myself feeling mighty restless by the end, or even halfway through, or even near the beginning, but objectively I know there are people who will embrace this movie."
0	"It's the sort of fluff that may catch your eye during channel-surfing sessions, but it's hardly worthy of an outing and an open wallet."
0	"It's like sitting down for risotto al Gorgonzola at a fine restaurant, hearing the can-opener in the kitchen and realizing that your chef's named Boyardee."
0	It's just about impossible to make this tired material fresh.
0	Has an undeniably generous heart even as it undertakes its all-too-familiar lessons.
0	"Aggressive heartwarmer, which turns out to be much more of a heartburner."
1	"Both movies have familiar and even hokey aspects, but they're also sincere rather than cynical, and there's something affecting about the very similar messages they're peddling."
0	Shallcross fails to infuse the proceedings with the wit or distinctiveness necessary to lift it above the crop of its so many similar-themed predecessors.
0	A third-rate Robin Williams movie that didn't even have the decency to hire Robin Williams.
0	Given its title and direct linkage to the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster -- nearly adds tasteless to its unflattering hat trick.
0	"I've seen a lot of terrible movies in the line of duty, but What Goes Up might be the only genuinely unreleasable one."
0	"Without a trace of tempo or one shred of narrative pacing, What Goes Up is not really a movie; it's the cheapest kind of amateurishness that looks like it was shot with a cell phone."
0	"While it's often as amateurish as it is assured, Glatzer and writer Robert Lawson want to convey so much that the sheer breadth of the movie means they hit a few of their targets."
0	[Director] Glatzer aims to wring laughter out of this desperation but succeeds only in producing a series of contrived characters and situations that make The Breakfast Club look like an unfiltered documentary.
0	"An unusually subdued Coogan does his best, but this is the kind of pretentious nonsense he usually satirizes."
0	"Mr. Coogan doesn't seem altogether comfortable with his part, which, like the story, undergoes a number of unconvincing changes."
0	
0	I never know quite what they were saying about heroism and then there are all these unanswered questions.
0	The film really struggles to find its voice and to find purpose and meaning.
0	"About as cruddy as a cruddy little indie can get, especially given a cast that should've known better."
0	"The whole thing feels like a premeditated attempt at a Sundance sensation, a mix of cast members (and ideas) from Juno and Hamlet 2 spiced up with the now obligatory '80s references."
1	"Director and co-writer Jonathan Glatzer handles his talented cast well, and the movie is dark, droll and sentimental in roughly the correct proportions."
0

1	"Modest, but resonant, It's Not Me, I Swear!, is a Quebec coming-of-age story that juggles elements of dark humour, pathos and childhood whimsy."
1	Impeccable production values help make this family angst unforgettable. Cinematographer Andr Turpin lenses with Ektachrome brilliance.
1	"Using cinema as self-therapy might be a selfish way to treat audiences, but Harden and Scheel's chemistry makes the mother-daughter dynamic universal."
1	A first film of laudable ambition and Meier's directorial confidence suggests promise for the future.
1	It would have been more effective if Meier had exercised less restraint and allowed her characters to spin out of control.
1	"The acting's superb, the premise intriguing, but it's hard to have sympathy for the heroine's stubbornness."
1	"Sometimes eerie, at other times playful and witty, it explores themes of modernity and primitivism without ever being heavy-handed. And as a portrait of a family under siege, it's as unsettling as it is sensual."
1	Prepare for this one to be rattling around the grey matter long after leaving the cinema. An auteur is born.
1	Home is actually less a road movie than the domestic-invasion movie taken to its sick conclusion.
1	Director Ursula Meier generally distinguishes her feature debut by not pushing elements to melodramatic or farcical extremes.
1	"Working with all-star DP Agns Godard, Meier effectively communicates the sense of upended privacy."
1	"The performers manage to overcome Meier's schematic framework-too ""modern-day fairy tale"" for its own good-though the director clearly knows which collaborators and elements to enlist for game-raising purposes."
1	"Though the cautionary symbolism is clear here, the committee-written film (there were five scribes including Meier), smartly keeps its message quotient in check."
1	Gradually the movie turns into an ironic assault on the inconvenient nature of civilization's conveniences.
1	"Home is the engaging, darkly funny, surreal story of what happens when people who have thrived by keeping civilization at a safe distance suddenly find themselves pushed right back into its headlights."
1	"What happens would not make sense in many households, but in this one, it represents a certain continuity, and confirms deep currents we sensed almost from the first."
1	"Melissa George's fearless, credible performance grounds the madness in a moving emotional reality, even as her sanity is lost at sea."
1	If you can get past its logical inconsistencies - and they are legion - it's not bad.
1	"A rather smart, interestingly constructed scary movie from British director Christopher Smith."
1	"Rackingly involving and, as corpses multiply, fearless of appearing penny-dreadful. Smith also made the loopy shocker Severance. This is becoming a body of work to watch."
1	This seaborne psycho-thriller has an unusual creepiness about it.
1	The whole film is smart cinema. I wouldn't be surprised if Smith didn't land up with a contract in Hollywood.
0	The film only makes some kind of sense on its own fantastic level.
1	Triangle is lots of violent fun for those who like... violent fun.
1	The pic climaxes in absurdism worthy of Herzog's doomed mad geniuses.
0	"While the portrayal of collaboration is respectable, and the balloon enchanting as it shimmers skyward, jellyfish-like, the doc is too flat for its own good."
1	There's a matter-of-factness to BLAST! that overcomes the documentary's lack of one strong thread.
0	If you really have a need to see Blast! wait for it to find its rightful place on cable.
1	"Directed by Paul Devlin, this absorbing documentary flirts with metaphysics...but mostly it keeps an amused eye on the effort of these driven brainiacs to set aloft an extremely sophisticated and fragile recording device."
1	Communicates the joys and heartbreaks of scientific creativity without unduly taxing viewers who don't know dark matter from pancake batter.
1	This globehopping video documentary...would be more at home on TLC or PBS than in a downtown specialty theater.
1	The comic premise still works like a charm.
1	"Get Him to the Greek is a complete blast, a much-needed breath of fresh air - well, as much fresh air as you can get in crowded clubs, packed rock shows and trashed hotel suites."
1	"It's crude, loud, dumb fun. And, on top of that, it contains the greatest cameo ever by a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics."
1	"Barring a few lapses, the gags fly by in rapid-fire fashion, and enough of them connect -- thanks in part to the amusing mix of Hill's hang-dog demeanor with Brand's lanky, relentless hedonism."
0	"A giddy Diddy turn aside, this wildly uneven comedy doesn't travel very far."
1	Get Him to the Greek turns out to be the funniest hard-R comedy since The Hangover.
1	"It has a rambly, realistic tone, with one orgiastic mishap spilling into the next, and that tone keeps much of the action popping with surprise."
1	"Greek doesn't quite know when to stop, and things aren't brought to a particularly satisfying resolution. But Brand does a nice job adding a few dramatic shadings to his character, a pleasant surprise. And Hill is outstanding."
1	Greek might be this year's The Hangover.
1	"The heavyset Hill is beginning to cultivate a likable John Candy-esque appeal; playing against the surprisingly sharp Sean Combs, as a hellacious boss, he grounds the movie in approachability as the orbiting players get crazier."
1	So comically fertile and yet so grounded in the reality of its characters that it's really a kind of marvel.
1	"The setup isn't especially interesting or original, but the movie gets better as it goes through its paces."
0	"The concept is inspired, and the movie has some very funny moments. But about halfway through this long weekend, the frantic tale grows flimsy."
1	Get Him to the Greek displays the bawdy-sweet mixture that is the signature of the Judd Apatow school of screen comedy.
1	"Get Him to the Greek has some big laughs, and it scores an endless source of points by skewering the rock-star lifestyle."
0	"There's no buildup, no narrative arc, just one scene of comically debauched partying after another."
0	Nobody goes to an R-rated man-love comedy for spiritual renewal. We just want more outlandish gags. Down with the uplift; up with the suppository jokes.
1	"Looking for a buddy comedy with wit, heart and scatological charm to spare? Get thee to this Greek."
1	"Aside from the useless gross-out scenes, Stoller and a perfectly tuned Brand get every detail right, including the seductive egomania of celebrities and the predatory fawning of their handlers."
0	"Stoller ... apparently has major trust issues with his odd-couple stars, women and the audience. Did I forget anybody?"
1	"Much snappy dialogue keeps the far-fetched shenanigans from collapsing into stupidity, and agile performances create genuineness in the relationships. Foremost is Brand, whose wry intelligence inspires an enormously appealing presence."
1	"The film succeeds as a music-industry satire, a very naughty version of Almost Famous."
1	"If the movie's all too predictable in its broad outlines, it's scurrilously funny in the details, and it pushes its two leads and one of its supporting actors in entertainingly fresh directions. For early June, that's enough."
1	"Hill, dialing back on the pissy vulgarity of his supporting roles in Knocked Up and Funny People, makes the perfect foil, as passive and impressionable as Brand is reckless and impulsive."
1	"It's not quite infectious, but some of the high notes manage to drown out some of the guttural lows."
1	"The movie's a good, rude commercial comedy. How many good movies have we even seen this year?"
1	"The reason the friendship works is that Russell Brand and Jonah Hill are good actors. Hill's character is required to be blotto half of the time, but there's the sense that he's desperately trying to do the right thing."
0	Making Aldous regret his wicked ways is a buzz-kill of major proportions.
1	Cheerfully profane in the manner of a dormitory bull session.
1	"This is personality comedy, and Brand and Hill have it to spare."
1	"A veering, careening joy ride of excess and heart."
1	"A little bit of Russell Brand can go a long way, but Greek is a fine vehicle for his mock rock-god persona."
1	"If the film hadn't made a beeline toward the ""serious movie with a message"" category we could have had another Hangover or Tropic Thunder on our hands."
0	You see the serious stuff as just another bad joke.
1	"A few too many grossout gags, but this is inspired lunacy, with P. Diddy (!) delivering one of the funniest performances of the year."
0	"It's rare that a previously established side character, no matter how well loved, can deliver the goods in his own show. Which is probably why nobody tries it with movies. Well, nobody but the makers of Get Him to the Greek."
0	"Some of the raunchy bits are amusing, but others prove that funny doesn't automatically follow from dirty."
1	"The movie's story is conventional in shape, but it has passages of crazy exhilaration and brilliant invention."
0	"W.C. Fields warned, ""Never work with children or animals."" Russell Brand and Jonah Hill can add, ""Never work with P. Diddy."""
1	"Brand can seem simultaneously randy and strung-out and is often very funny. Hill is surprisingly touching, which is quite a feat given the number of orifices he is required to display."
1	"Get Him to the Greek ticks all the boxes. It's a satire on rock'n'roll, with Russell Brand as a drugs- and booze-addled English rock star who's trying to restart his career and get back his lost love, model-turned-singer Jackie Q (a Cockney Rose Byrne)"
0	"Given that Judd Apatow is a co-producer, you'd at least expect the film to make you laugh. The humour's all over the place, though."
1	"This is Brand's movie all the way: he's the one snorting the drugs, throwing the tantrums and getting the lion's share of the laughs."
1	"This is Brand's bag: a man intoxicated with himself, who'll never shut up or stop messing around with east London slang and 19th-century swear words until the world drops its knickers."
1	"This is Brand's film, and every aspect of his persona is played to the max - the sexual magnetism, the multiple addictions, the doting but distant mum, the hangers-on and women who want to control him."
0	"The basic tonal problem is established right at the outset: we are being invited to laugh at exotic limey Aldous, whereas Brand's stand-up persona needs us to laugh with him and to see the world through his eyes."
0	
0	"With everything glimpsed at a comfortable overhead distance, our planet becomes so much eye candy for the Nat Geo set."
0	"Though there is little here for an informed person to take issue with, the film's well-intentioned preachiness is unlikely to win over those who favor Genesis and denial over climate science."
1	"The End of the Line understates its case. If what it says is true, it does not seem angry enough. And does it really provide enough facts to underline its argument?"
1	"The poignant facts and figures are offered by a host of likeable marine scientists, local fishermen and activists."
1	"Everyone should watch this film, or at least familiarise themselves with the issues."
1	Murray's film is clear-sighted about the tough choices involved.
0	"Some important questions are raised, but ultimately the insubstantiality of the film's arguments nags."
1	"The film, with its dramatic soundtrack and mood of high intensity, feels like a political broadcast. But it's a persuasive and very important one."
1	"Are we allowed to love what we plan to kill and eat? Perhaps we are. Or perhaps it is the cunning sentimentality of the filmmaker, hooking the viewer in with heartwarming pictures before throwing him into the good-causes basket."
1	"It serves up the science of this potential catastrophe in firm, digestible chunks, though it perhaps didn't require the gloopy New Age music as garnish."
1	"The End of the Line is a free-form splash of jaw-dropping graphs, impressively accredited talking heads, and sumptuously shot portraits of natural beauty and decay, overdramatically scored to symphonic and other intense musical attacks."
0	"Sobering stuff, but presented with no more flair than a television news item."
1	"This passionate ecological documentary, The End of the Line, spells out the problem in clear, urgent, prosaic terms."
1	"Through graph-wielding scientists, picturesque seascapes and Ted Danson's voiceover, director Rupert Murray lays out the facts about the ongoing decimation of world fishing stocks, which could mean the end of tuna as we know it."
0	"Except for lush underwater shots, the movie is dry and preachy. And it would not have hurt to give the other side a chance to respond."
1	The End of the Line is an apocalyptic documentary that is as beautiful as it is damning.
1	"The End of the Line, an eco-mentary that warns against overfishing, baits its hook with alarmist rhetoric and aversion therapy."
1	The End of the Line documents what threatens to become an irreversible decline in aquatic populations within 40 years.
0	It's hard not to feel that the vital information in The End of the Line may have been more effectively relayed by Clover's original book or by a movie whose methods were less pedantic and pedestrian.
1	"Another day, another film about environmental collapse."
0	"This movie wants to cover every base without thinking very deeply about them. So while a lot of ground is covered in 80 brisk minutes, the information presented is only abstractly useful."
1	"If the tone is occasionally off-putting, the message -- at least, the facts about the fish -- is harder to shrug off."
1	The Eclipse is a curious Irish ghost story that fiddles with the recipe just enough to produce interesting results.
0	"Unlike McPherson's stage work, The Eclipse never finds a common ground between the fantastic and the heartfelt."
1	The Eclipse finds plenty of heartfelt gravity in its tale of love lost and found on a gothic coast.
1	"Though The Eclipse travels a sleepy route to a shrug of anticlimax, it's refreshing to see a film acknowledge that life and love don't end at 50, even in the outsized shadow of a soulmate's death."
1	"Makes good on its name by sometimes obscuring its themes and even point, which can have its charms though also severe drawbacks."
1	"McPherson balances these disparate elements with great skill, never resorting to cheap scare tactics in what amounts to a sensitive character study."
0	"he acting is of the highest caliber, but the characters and their circumstances are underwritten."
1	A leisurely and quite lovely drama that honors the conventions of gothic ghost stories without the slightest stain of self-irony.
0	"McPherson -- while getting some lovely shots of the Irish seaside -- never succeeds in making Michael's literary interests, or Lena's passionate interests, seem quite plausible."
1	"The Eclipse is about death and sadness, rebirth and possibility. The film is anchored by Hinds' performance -- the actor brings a soulful melancholy to the proceedings."
1	An interesting blend of very nicely observed character based drama with some horror movie effects.
1	"A smart, scary, spine-tinglingly matter-of-fact ghost story."
1	There are few surprises hidden in the film's hushed spookiness.
0	"Ultimately, though, it feels fleeting and slight passing across our line of vision, never a full but merely a partial engagement."
1	"McPherson has managed a rare hat trick in genre mash-up, fashioning a deeply absorbing movie that balances horror, romance, comedy and observant humanism with surprising finesse."
1	An above-average ghost tale elevated by its cast.
1	"In his quiet house hung with portraits of those who have become ghosts, Michael finally learns to mourn, and we realize that storytelling is how a writer grieves."
1	"The town and surrounding landscapes make a gorgeous setting -- the Irish tourist board will be happy -- but at its heart The Eclipse is a small, contained ghost story about a haunted man learning to exorcise himself."
1	"Hinds, who scored the Best Actor award when the film screened at the Tribeca Festival in New York, possesses an unassuming versatility."
0	"While McPherson may have an extensive reputation as a playwright, as a filmmaker he's one step up from a total amateur."
1	"Hinds has been ready for a role of this size and shape for years; it was simply a matter of finding it, and its finding him."
1	"The supernatural never seems far out of sight in Ireland, and it creeps in here and there during The Eclipse, a dark romance set at a literary festival in the County Cork cathedral town of Cobh. I'm not sure it's required, but it does little harm."
1	"McPherson brews a strangely appealing composite, a movie that is mostly character-driven romance but that seasons the proceedings with timely scare-your-pants-off moments of horror."
1	"Quinn, alternately charming and loathsome, is brilliant, as is Hinds, an actor who has elevated everything he's been in."
1	"The whole thing would probably have flown apart if not for Hinds, whose character, like a dark star imploding, pulls everything toward him."
1	"Missed opportunities and surface gestures aside, Hancock draws affable, energetic performances from all concerned."
1	"Another uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama."
0	"In every scene, Oher is instructed, lectured, comforted, or petted like a big puppy; he is merely a cipher."
1	"Some will doubtlessly dismiss The Blind Side as another example of a heroic white person saving a black victim but, although there is an element of truth in that perfunctory description, it misses the point."
1	Writer-director John Lee Hancock wisely lets the true story of Michael Oher speak for itself.
0	"What The Blind Side offers is a kind of liberal Hollywood version of conservative values: all rock-solid valor, all the time."
1	The movie's a pretty conventional feel-good sports drama in many ways. But Bullock and Aaron give it heart that transcends the genre.
1	"While it's possible to be enormously entertained and moved by The Blind Side, it's also possible to harbor a twinge of misgiving."
0	It's just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.
1	"'The Blind Side' may not make the All-American sports movies team, but it plays with plenty of heart."
0	"If someone were telling you this story, you might say, ""Wow. That's something."" Even so, the narrative is not quite big enough to bear the weight and significance that writer-director John Lee Hancock tries to attach to it."
1	"If Frank Capra was still around, director John Lee Hancock might have had to fight him for the job."
0	"Except for a few crude exchanges,The Blind Side is almost as squeaky-clean as an old Disney movie. Unfortunately, it can also be just as cute and condescending."
0	"Director John Lee Hancock's only aiming for a crowd pleaser, and by not challenging the established playbook for inspirational sports dramas, he's no doubt got one."
0	"There's real ambiguity in the Oher case, but writer-director John Lee Hancock papers over it; it's possible to see the Tuohys as generous, caring people without brushing off their less-altruistic reasons for sponsoring Oher."
0	"The Blind Side fumbles a remarkable, true story of an African-American product of the West Memphis projects who ended up at a Christian school and in the care of a wealthy white family, and then went on to professional football glory."
0	Writer-director John Lee Hancock has turned Oher's remarkable life into a Hollywood fable that trades difficult truths for easy clichs.
0	The problem with a story that's almost too good to be true is that someone in Hollywood will try to make it better.
0	"What a drag that, one year into Obama's presidency, American films remain so careful about depicting black actors."
1	"It's a cute, touchy-feely crowd pleaser that wants nothing more than to wrap audiences in a warm holiday embrace. In a sense, it achieves that goal, but it is overly sentimental in a Lifetime movie kind-of-way."
1	"We never learn why Leigh Anne is so fearless, but Bullock is the force here. McGraw is an amiable anchor to her bull-by-the-horns portrayal."
1	"Upon seeing [Bullock's] Oscar-worthy performance is ""finally!"" followed quickly by, ""Why the heck did it take so long?"""
1	The filmmakers pay lip service to the story's racial undertones without ever really rocking the leaky boat.
0	A movie made up almost entirely of turning points and yet curiously devoid of drama or suspense.
0	"The movie glosses over the deeper issues of the tale, ones dealing with race, poverty, privilege and ethics, opting for the feel-good quick hit that makes the overall experience unsatisfying."
1	"What makes The Blind Side a Thanksgiving treat is director Hancock's subtle touch and admirable refusal to yield to sports movie clichs, something he did previously with The Rookie and Remember the Titans."
0	"It's hard to overlook that while Michael's benefactors are white, the villains in the movie are black."
0	Its superficiality keeps it from being the moving story it could have been.
1	"However obvious, The Blind Side is touching -- despite its habit of dropping major character notes into the melody without warning."
1	"Oher(TM)s life is meant to make us feel good, and it mostly does. But how good we feel about his story is proportional to how blind we(TM)re willing to be about how it(TM)s told."
1	"The Blind Side is a big budget, well crafted and finely honed... movie of the week."
0	"Bullock turns in a terrific, ball-breaking performance. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is painfully patronising."
0	"Shows that America, for all its loudhailed Christianity, doesn't really need God at all. It just needs Sandra Bullock and her like."
0	"A few momentary hiccups aside, the film plays out in sickly-sweet fashion, relentlessly shoving the Touhy's self-righteous values down the audiences' throat and never bothering to consider the wider social ramifications..."
0	"It's a celluloid version of Paul McCartney and Stevie's Wonder's Ebony and Ivory, one in which pious, infantilizing didacticism masquerades as humanitarianism."
0	"Quite how Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her one-note turn as bleached supermum Leigh-Anne is a mystery, since it transforms a potentially worthwhile character study into a grandstanding star vehicle."
0	"A Photoshopped image of reality that is bland, parochial, and stereotypically acted by a cast who have nothing like the subtlety and range of Trey Parker's puppets from Team America: World Police."
0	"The movie is done with crispness, vigor, down-home humor, and an over-all tang of good feeling, but the pushing of buttons is the work of extraordinary calculation."
1	"As a fable about the power of giving, it hits pretty hard."
0	This unabashedly sentimental and outright anti-English pic is stodgy as a cheap haggis with nationalistic sentimentality.
1	"Smith, who also wrote the screenplay, is all brisk efficiency over the course of the movie's fat-free 96 minutes."
1	"Written and directed by an American, the film nevertheless feels closer to the 'British' spirit of the old Ealing comedies, something emphasised by its old-fashioned ambience and its charming evocation of the period."
0	"Writer/director Charles Martin Smith is American, which wouldn't matter if this didn't feel so much like a wee-dram-and-bagpipes invitation to a mythical Scotland of yesteryear."
1	Writer/director Charles Martin Smith brings energy and wit to this British-Canadian co-production.

0	The animals here don't talk; that's the movie's one saving grace.
0	"A stupid, mean-spirited little movie that ranks down there with the worst in recent memory. Distant memory, too."
0	"Director Roger Kumble began his big-screen career with a clever Dangerous Liaisons set in high school, Cruel Intentions, and worked his way down to College Road Trip and now this."
0	"This coarse family film is an insult to sentient families. Purporting to encourage conservation and the love of animals, it's a slight to true environmentalists and, heck, even an affront to animals."
0	"In its cretinous fashion, Furry Vengeance is almost impressive. Here's a pro-nature, anti-development family comedy that appears to be made by and for people who never leave the mall."
0	Furry Vengeance is fundamentally about Brendan Fraser getting beat up by creepily anthropomorphized animals. Proceed at your own risk.
0	"No animals may have been hurt in this production, but Brendan Fraser was."
0	Even professional judgment as faulty as Fraser's can't explain his presence in this fleabitten fiasco.
0	"I'm not convinced that repeated assaults to the groin, bee stings to the eyes, raccoon pee in the mouth, or skunk stink sprayed head to toe is the way to teach ecological balance."
0	Furry Vengeance is a collection of feeble jokes in the service of green themes. Sustainability never looked so stupid.
0	"Furry Vengeance is billed as a comedy, but I doubt it'll make you laugh. It might, however, cause you to weep for Brendan Fraser."
0	The paradox here is that the message of respect for animal life is outweighed by the lack of respect for human beings.
0	"Furry Vengeance is unbearable. (Actually, the bear's performance is pretty good.)"
0	Even the obligatory blooper reel that runs during the closing credits is painful in its desperation to generate laughs.
0	"Imagine Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds as a children's comedy, and you have a rough idea of the excruciatingly unfunny Furry Vengeance, which keeps slamming the audience over the head with a single joke."
0	"Kids will lose their minds at the sight of Fraser in a skin-tight pink tracksuit with the words ""Yum Yum"" on his sizeable backside. Parents will sigh and eat popcorn."
0	Even calling it a family flick is to run the risk of guiding families toward it by mistake.
0	"The whole movie feels extrapolated from the five-second clip of a scheming chipmunk on YouTube, bulked out with shots of Fraser being thwacked with some generic crunch noise and falling backwards with his feet in the air."
1	"Sophisticated it isn't, but there are some decent visual gags and Fraser is good fun as the man at war with nature."
0	"Did they have to pad it out with so many repeated pratfalls and inconsequential guff? It should play well enough with the under tens, mind."
0	"Shields is not a natural comic performer, to say the least. Her face has the comic mobility and expressiveness of an Easter Island statue."
0	People often ask reviewers to choose the worst film of the year so far. At last I have a cast-iron candidate.
0	The only saving grace of this wannabe Looney Tune? The animals don't talk.
0	"Sooner or later, you might be inclined to root for hapless predators like Sylvester the Cat or Wile E. Coyote because they are the underdogs and their prey are far more obnoxious than they are."
1	"The family drama resonates strongly with a resolution that, in retrospect, seems like the only way the brothers could have rediscovered blood ties. Meanwhile their fights are downright compelling."
1	An improbably effective and affecting mix of raw emotions and exciting smackdowns.
1	"Ultimately, this movie is more about the dark, bloody conflicts within the human heart than it is about what transpires in the cage."
1	It's about broken families coming together. It's about economic desperation and about America getting off the ropes and recovering its fighting spirit.
1	"Old line-gargler Nolte remains an effortlessly moving presence, while Hardy and Edgerton embody their archetypes and handle the physical demands."
1	"A double-barreled Rocky for the mixed martial arts generations, the practically epic fight film Warrior is one of the most exhilarating surprises of this summer movie season."
1	Director Gavin O'Connor has turned the octagon of Ultimate Fighting into a cage of boiling family emotion.
1	"Against all odds, Warrior sucks you in and leaves you thrumming with excitement."
1	"All in all, though, Warrior wins on points, even with a resolution that didn't work for me."
1	Hardy is as good an actor as there is working today; his intensity here is amazing. Nolte hasn't been this good in a long time. And Edgerton holds his own with both.
1	"Works like gangbusters -- tears will be stifled by the end of the sibling vs. sibling finale -- and most of the credit should go to Hardy, Nolte and Edgerton."
1	"Skillfully made and adrenalin-fueled, Warrior is nothing like what I expected. It overcomes inescapable boxing and martial arts clichs and leaves you thoroughly sated, energized and wanting more."
1	"Yes, the coincidences are fast and furious, but both Edgerton and Hardy give powerful performances as damaged men."
0	"Hits things so hard, both literally and metaphorically, that it's hard not to feel pummeled yourself by the time it's over."
1	The plot is Shakespeare meets Balboa.
0	"Choppy editing makes a hash out of the fight scenes, and, by the end, a Neanderthal sensibility asserts itself: A brotherly beating makes the heart grow fonder."
1	"The two leads, Edgerton and Hardy, pull off their respective roles - rising above the cliches and the melodrama - with ferocity and focus."
0	"All the director and co-writer Gavin O'Connor does is apply old boxing-film tricks to what is, for the movies, a new sport. Then he doubles them."
1	"It is appropriately blunt, powerful and relentless, a study of male bodies in sweaty motion and masculine emotions in teary turmoil."
1	"Every time you start resisting, somehow the film makes the sale, again."
0	"O'Connor chucks away everything that was interesting or dark or subtle in ""Warrior"" and replaces it with a pseudo-individualist, sub-Freudian, Tea Party-friendly fantasy."
1	"Warrior is a man-weepie of the highest Hollywood order, a would-be Rocky for an empire in decline."
1	This is a rare fight movie in which we don't want to see either fighter lose.
1	"Lovers of the sport and macho men in general be warned: Warrior is so beautifully constructed and emotionally engaging, the tears are almost certain to fall. Bring a hankie and/or a very discreet companion."
1	"The beats are familiar, the stakes are high, the fights are brutal, and the rewards are just."
1	"O'Connor films the fight scenes, and the fight training scenes leading up to them, with the requisite oomph."
1	"For all the contemporary references, it's essentially a spin on the story of Cain and Abel, which may be the reason it feels timeless."
1	"It's also a fight movie that knows all the fight movie cliches and doesn't shy away from embracing them wholeheartedly. But it hits its marks and hits them well, and feels fresh even as it traffics so deeply in the familiar."
1	"Warrior is a weirdly affecting hybrid, a 100-proof melodrama that's two-thirds Sylvester Stallone and one-third Eugene O'Neill. Think Rocky's Long Day's Journey into Night."
1	Director Gavin O'Connor comes out swinging in this flawed but fiercely moving family drama...Strong stuff.
1	"While ""Warrior"" does offer enough jaw-snapping action to sate any 'roid-ragers in the audience, it works on deeper levels as well."
0	"Nolte's performance is masterful, marshalling together pain and regret and a slowly dawning comprehension in a single wince. But all this film has going for it besides him are its incredibly brutal fight scenes."
0	A cheap exploitation picture wrapped in miles and miles of stale would-be Oscar scenes...
1	"""Warrior"" could have used a bit more guts. But it's still a knockout."
1	This fictional drama about two men struggling with the anger planted in them by their abusive father has moments of power that push through a fake-out script.
0	"Warrior's three principle characterizations are compelling - Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling, sad-eyed wreck of a dad - but not enough to mask the film's lesser elements."
1	It's too corny to live. But the picture is a slam dunk. I mean a ground-and-pound double-leg takedown. It's really gripping.
1	Warrior ends up feeling a lot bigger than you expect it to.
1	"The movie is so skillfully made, and the performances are so convincingly real (Hardy is sensational), that, as it reaches its cathartic, winning finish, it achieves a surprising compassion and honesty."
1	This doesn't pack a punch like 'The Fighter' - but it's still a must for grapple fans.
0	Has to conform to the lunkhead straitjacket of the tournament format: one dufus pounding another in extreme close-up for what seems like an eternity.
1	Hardy's physicality here is something to behold: you wonder how many personal trainers he worked his way through to get those neck muscles.
1	"Sickly sentimental, but the barnstorming fight scenes will leave you counting stars."
1	Carries you along despite its obvious faults and pretensions
0	"Grainy, hand-held cinematography can't lend authenticity to the forced emotion."
1	Its three leads certainly deserve consideration for their artfulness in being able to infuse it with intimations of quality.
0	"Noisy and excessive where the original was hushed and restrained, and wholly devoid of mystique..."
0	"Lang's film, the last he made in the U.S., exposed the immorality of the death penalty; Hyams's retread offers only more plot and longer, louder car chases."
0	"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt feels like some throwaway 1980s TV movie, with its implausible premise, dizzying twists, cheesy montages and melodramatic score."
0	"Douglas makes smarm a chewy pleasure, but this is a noir in search of a hero we can root for because we actually buy what he's doing."
0	"Any amateur magician can successfully yank the tablecloth away, but it's only impressive if there's something of value on the table."
0	"Like its title, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a generic, forgettable courtroom thriller."
0	What you won't be able to figure out is why this laughable yarn didn't go straight to DVD.
0	The leads can't lend either spunk or gravitas to what was already a preposterous yarn 50 years ago.
0	There are plenty of reasonable doubts about his mediocre legal thriller remake.
0	"I've got no problem with movies that stack up twists like crazy straws. Hyam's script, however, depends on us being dumber than every character in the film-you'd have to reach protozoan levels just to resist wanting to strangle everyone in it."
0	"Despite excellent stunt work and a too-brief appearance by Orlando Jones as an unflappable cop, the movie -- unlike Mr. Douglas's hairdo -- never rises above mediocrity."
0	"What I can't figure out is how director Peter Hyams can remake a 1956 movie from the great Fritz Lang and not learn anything about suspense, pacing and storytelling in the process."
0	A good rule to follow for wannabe gritty thrillers: Lead actors shouldn't remind you of late-night informercial pitchmen.
0	"There's little in this pointless rehash to distract audiences from the pleasure of watching Tamblyn, a fine young actress whose direct, grownup stare belies her baby features."
1	"Successfully balancing art-film portraiture with a gangster picture's plot, the film may be one of the more conventional movies in this year's Cannes competition, it's also been one of the more satisfying."
1	"French master Jacques Audiard has challenged the thus-far mostly middling Cannes competition with a powerful prison drama that's an old-fashioned Bildungsroman in in-your-face, intensely realistic disguise."
1	Audiard's sensationally directed set pieces and the quietly compelling performance by Rahim hold interest throughout
1	"The sheer force of Audiard's direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style - even if not always to understand his motives."
1	"A Prophet, Jacques Audiard's masterful prison saga, will undoubtedly be considered to be one of the great films of 2010, if not the coming decade."
1	"This is the work of the rarest kind of film-maker, the kind who knows precisely what he is doing and where he is going. The film's every effect is entirely intentional."
1	"Its similarity to pulp Hollywood - in a festival context, a valuable antidote to art-house sprawl and drift - now makes it seem more rather than less generic."
1	"The Gallic gangster tradition appears to be in rude health. Audiard's film is a triumph that deserves international recognition, but as with the likes of Gomorrah, films that tell it like it is reap their own rewards."
1	"This is a moral movie set in an immoral world, one of those circle-squaring feats at which French drama and cinema so darkly excel."
1	"A Prophet will be bracketed in years to come as a prison drama, but it will stay in the memory of those who see it as a character study, bristling with cross-currents of feeling and sharp observation."
1	"The reach of the film goes well beyond France and beyond Europe: it might be the most gripping work of art this year, and not seeing it could seriously damage your interestingness."
1	Jacques Audiard's prison drama is a bracingly cynical antidote to the waftiness of much French cinema.
1	"With a rich vein of brains, brawn and twists to constantly turn this film and its audience on their heads, Une Prophet is a truly compelling journey into the criminal world, that may well prove to be the Godfather of its generation."
1	"Rahim is an exciting, unpredictable presence, and Arestrup's Csar has a stature that's nearly Shakespearean."
1	"Jacques Audiard's film, which lasts two and a half hours, maintains an unflagging urgency, stalling only when the double-dealing grows too dense."
0	"The film is deficient in form and content-not naturalistic so much as neutered, less revisionist than rote."
1	A quietly stunning saga that won the Grand Prix last year at Cannes and is a worthy Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film...
1	A Prophet is one of those rare films in which the moral stakes are as insistent and thought through as the aesthetic choices.
1	"Thoroughly absorbing, exciting, even poetic."
1	"Rahim and Arestrup are both so outstanding that if this were an English-language film, they'd probably be nominated for Oscars, too. Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2010/02/26/2010-02-26_short_takes_a_prophet_art_of_the_steal_y"
1	"A Prophet is a compelling piece of naturalistic filmmaking, claustrophobic and thought-provoking."
1	An answered prayer for those who believe that revitalizing classic forms with contemporary attitudes makes for the most compelling kind of cinema.
1	"A Prophet is uncompromising in its style, story and characterizations."
1	"A highly original film made in a familiar context, and an exciting moviegoing experience you shouldn't miss."
1	Director Jacques Audiard scores a triumph of the highest order with the defiant poetry of his vision.
1	Stephane Fontaine's hand-held lensing complements Audiard's in-your-face bravado.
1	"If his two previous films suggested a director dipping a few toes in dark waters, Un Prophete marks the moment when Audiard took the plunge."
1	This is a class of movie that operates on a higher plane than its peers. I wrestled with it. But on some level it's here to be wrestled with.
1	"Writer-director Jacques Audiard manages to replicate The Godfather's most elusive element, not the dark comedy or the operatic bloodletting, but the incremental corruption of a decent man into a willful, coldhearted killer."
1	"A Prophet pushes its protagonist into circumstances he did not choose but in which he watches and learns and kills and eventually becomes all he can be, albeit criminally."
1	"The newcomer Rahim is an enigma. What is he thinking? I believe that's the quality Audiard wants. He's a newly poured man, and when the mold sets, it happens inside."
1	"A Prophet is as gripping as any recent film about crime and criminals, although its ill-focused attempts to incorporate elements of the supernatural (prophetic visions and ghostly apparitions) are bizarre and ineffective."
1	Tremendously watchable cinema.
1	An object lesson in how prison can serve as a finishing school for crooks.
1	"Amidst the gloom, urgently summoning our attention, is one of the most impressive performances of recent times, by relative newcomer Tahar Rahim."
1	A Prophet solidifies director Jacques Audiard's standing as a criminal mastermind whose work leaves genre classifications in the dust.
1	"Although these aren't characters with whom filmgoers will have an instinctive rooting interest, Rahim and Arestrup imbue them with fascinating nuances and, in Rahim's case, surprising vulnerability."
1	"In Jacques Audiard's haunting prison drama A Prophet, we watch a young man transformed by life behind bars."
1	"Rahim, with only a few film and TV roles behind him, gives a performance of startling force and subtlety."
1	"A really satisfying, meaty film."
1	"The film never succumbs to the pitfalls of the prison-movie genre, and there's something poetic about how Audiard, in the midst of all this violence, manages to make a punch to the stomach seem like the most violent act of all."
1	"Audiard never overplays the new experiences facing Malik, be they violent or touching. Yet his tender regard for our complicated hero shines through."
1	"The success of Malik is sheer American dream via France: Anyone can make it if they try hard enough. Make it at what, of course, is always the question."
1	"A Prophet is essential viewing for art-film buffs and crime-flick fans, but also for anyone who's looking for a great story, terrific acting and masterful filmmaking."
1	"Audiard has talked about the prospects of a sequel to A Prophet. With the foundation he has built here, it would be a welcome one."
1	"A movie that stands with the best prison thrillers from any country; a film that vividly illustrates the connection between prison and the violent, radical form of Islam that keeps much of Europe on edge."
1	
1	"A Prophet is not a fabulous film, but it is well worth seeing. Although it is 2 hours 29 minutes long and its story is not surprising, it is always riveting."
0	Competent but unimaginative.
0	"If nothing else, Homecoming should effectively squelch any movie-star ambition on the part of Mischa Barton, though the camera is more than usually attentive to her cleavage."
0	"Nothing in the film is truly, laughably bad, but then -- unlike this year's Obsessed -- nothing is campily entertaining, either."
0	"As ineffectual police work and broken feet stack up, the silliness gets out of hand."
0	"Everything, including the ending, plays out exactly as you'd expect."
0	Homecoming is coldly efficient for what it is. But what it is is trash.
0	An unmitigated B-movie that isn't thrilling enough or cheesy enough to make it worth the trip.
0	Neither trashy nor self-consciously funny enough to make its genre-trapped ludicrousness sing.
0	
1	"This is conventional dramatic material played with an occasionally heavy hand, but sculpted with care and quiet assurance by helmer Neil Abramson."
1	"Stirringly told, American Son dramatizes a harsh social reality and tributes this nation's fighting force."
0	"Serviceably enjoyable, like cold pizza but little more."
0	"Franois Velle's local crime drama is so earnest, it feels unkind to tell the truth -- which is that we've seen this story, told in just this way, too many times before."
0	A tired and derivative plot builds up to an unconvincing series of shootings with which the movie fills its violence quota.
0	The Narrows is too riddled with clichs reaching past Scorsese all the way to Cagney flicks to be any more effective than a mowed-down capo.
0	"Until it implodes with preposterous plot manipulations, The Narrows can be appreciated as the film equivalent of a reasonably palatable pasta dish concocted from a familiar recipe and served in a no-frills restaurant."

1	"It's a small, peculiar film, one unlikely to appeal much to women, non-sports fans and mainstreamers, but its uncomfortable comic insights should win it a loyal following."

0	"Audiences are invited to congratulate themselves for not reviling Paul, as long as they keep him at arm's length."
1	Robert Siegel makes a potent directing debut with a scrappy movie that refuses to sentimentalize or ridicule its besieged hero worshipper.
1	"Mr. Siegel nails so many quirky details, and finds humor in the smallest of moments, that Big Fan is surprisingly poignant, too."
1	Big Fan is a spasmodically funny and bleak film about the love that speaks its name.
1	"Big Fan shares a nutty kinship with the obsessive-loner pictures of Martin Scorsese, namely Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. And while Oswalt is no De Niro, the stand-up comic brings a schlumpy pathos to his portrait that shows depth and dimension."
1	"The movie concludes with a series of tense, unpredictable scenes. Isn't that why we love sports so much, because we never know what will happen?"
1	"Superb Noo Yawk attitude, dialogue and performances keep the movie lively and tart, but it also turns out to have a surprising plot with a few twists you won't see coming."
1	"Writer/director Robert D. Siegel understands the psychology of the obsessive sports fan, and he brings it to the screen in Big Fan, a dark comedy that occasionally skirts close to the edge of tragedy."
1	"With its unremittingly bleak humor and eagerness to plumb the depths of fanboy abjection, Big Fan seems destined for a future in the cult canon."
0	"The movie gets repetitive, and when it calls an audible and goes somewhere unexpected, it pulls back quickly. Too bad."
1	"Robert Siegel, the writer-director of Big Fan, was also the writer of The Wrestler, last year's most overrated movie. In some ways, I like this one more, but it's yet another grunge fest."
1	"An unblinking look at the hidden (or perhaps not so ??hidden) pathology of American sports mania, in which the power and victory of your team becomes the sole conduit for your self-worth."
1	"Big Fan isn't a touchdown, but its patient torture reminded me of the rest of the world's football: tense stretches of nothing with enough killer moments to cheer."
1	What's left is a vivid portrait of an exceedingly ordinary man for whom there's no great epiphany or cliched redemption. That may be Siegel's trickiest play of all.
0	"It's a modest, drab little drama about a psychologically unstable guy living in a sad little corner of America."
1	[Oswalt] is doing work here he has never done on screen.
1	"Big Fan is a poignant, dead-on character study, an examination of a crisis in the life of the most die-hard of die-hard New York Giants football fans."
1	"Oswalt nails Paul's mix of sadness and devotion, and Siegel gives the whole affair an air of gloom with just the barest hint of satire."
1	A bleakly funny character study of a very particular species of urban fauna -- the sports radio call-in fanatic -- Big Fan is compulsively watchable.
1	"In his first starring role, Oswalt, a stand-up comedian whose trademark persona is part comic-book geek and part frat-house hedonist, inhabits a character who is both painfully familiar and poignantly alone."
1	"A comedy with dark undertones, it asks: What kind of a man listens to and calls sports talk radio compulsively, even at 2 a.m.? Even out of season? Even on, say, Thanksgiving? He should get a life, do you think?"
1	"Though the movie isn't much to look at, he gets a credibly dark and pathetic performance from the typically comic Oswalt."
1	"It's a classic situation, transplanted to a small, petty arena. When I think of this movie, I think of Oswalt, how his anguish feels real (whether we understand it or not) and how his face unaccountably becomes an offbeat locus of dignity."
1	"Writer-director Robert D. Siegel grew up listening to callers like Paul on The FAN, New York City's all-sports radio, and he gives us a bizarrely sympathetic portrait of a guy who is as devout and as obsessive as any religious fanatic."
1	"First-time director Siegel shows promise. His script is solid, and although the last act feels somewhat awkward, the idea is clever."
1	
1	Noyce rolls up his sleeves and delivers an unpretentious piece of action-movie craftsmanship that proves worthy of its star's own consummate professionalism.
1	"While preposterous at every turn, Salt is a better Bond movie than most recent Bond movies, as its makers keep the stunts real and severely limit CGI gimmickry."
1	"This is still closer to product than art. Highly satisfying, often exhilarating, refreshingly unpretentious product."
0	It's easy to figure out what Salt is. But who is she? That's a question the film never really seemed interested in answering.
1	Jolie herself is in her full glory here as a character born when Bond and Brezhnev ruled.
1	"This old-fashioned spy actioner... is fast-moving, exciting and contains more twists than a tunnel under Checkpoint Charlie."
1	It's like a John le Carr double-agent yarn compacted into comic-book pulp as if by the makers of Con Air.
1	"Salt is primed to keep your pulse racing so your brain will stop thinking, ""WTF!"" Go with the illogic or you'll miss the fun."
0	"Jolie's days as an action heroine may be behind her. She's still got the cruel lips. But at some point, a cookie or two needs to pass over them to give her the brawn to pull off this stuff."
0	"Honestly, if this is the best the CIA, the Secret Service, the NYPD and whatever other government agency tasked with finding bad guys can do, we're in worse trouble than we thought."
0	Things slowly start to deteriorate despite the best efforts of the star and her behind-the-scenes collaborators.
0	Salt is about as believable as a secret training program for military pilots consisting entirely of kangaroos in flight helmets. But it must be said that the star carries her load admirably.
0	Jolie does as well as she can with the twigs they've given her to make a plot house out of.
1	"Its narrative strategy is to leave audiences in the dark for much of the action, but each tidbit we're given fits into the broader picture. The action scenes are imaginative and elaborate without seeming fake."
1	"Really, who goes to summer action movies for cast-iron logic anyway? Or for plausible characters, for that matter?"
1	"Salt is a well-greased, smoothly functioning machine that drives forward with tremendous momentum, elevating your pulse rate and relieving you of the need to think for more than a second or two at a stretch."
1	Noyce's methods of crafting suspense are defiantly old-fashioned: low-angle shots for maximum viewer disorientation and a preference for daredevil stunt work over CGI cheating.
1	A relentlessly moving flick that cements Jolie's position as queen of the action stars.
1	"As she tries to find her husband, and perhaps assassinate the Russian president, she's not quite sure who or what she is. And neither are we. Which is precisely why the whole thing works."
1	"The relentless pace, hair-raising stunts and air of affected gravitas also goes a long way in boosting Salt a rung above much of this summer's other multiplex fare as a top-notch action thriller."
0	"While the plot is outlandish, it unspools with obvious twists and turns. The film has its tense moments, but instead of dazzle, there's a workmanlike quality to the action sequences."
0	"Jolie's action vehicle is just that -- an action vehicle, moving fast but thinking slow."
0	The kind of thriller that skitters after its star playing catch-up.
0	"I want the Evelyn Salt workout. Otherwise, Salt is ridiculous."
1	"Noyce's past excursions into action filmmaking, most notably the Harrison Ford-as-Jack Ryan films, have been a bit flavorless, but here he delivers one from the gut."
1	"Like the condiment whose name it shares, director Phillip Noyce's run-like-hell thriller starring Angelina Jolie satisfies a basic human taste -- something to go with the popcorn. I liked it. It knows what it's doing."
0	Why is Angelina Jolie starring in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie?
1	It's like a rebuke to all the lousy action movie directors who've been banging pots and pans together in our skulls. It winds your clock tight and the alarm doesn't go off for 100 minutes.
0	"There comes a point when it becomes difficult to take Salt seriously. That would be fine if this was an intentional parody of action spy thrillers, but it's not."
1	"An old-school spy vs. spy action film complete with elaborate car and foot chases, deadly sleeper agents and frosty-eyed, vodka-shooting Soviet stalwarts who lament the fall of Communism and chortle evilly over the possibility of destroying the [USA]."
1	"Salt, a ludicrous but somehow credible spy thriller starring Angelina Jolie, delivers a swift, super-charged kick in the pants."
0	"As a consumable resource, Salt goes down easy, but it's lacking both nourishment and flavor."
1	A more swiftly assembled spy thriller than anything since 'The Bourne Ultimatum.'
1	"The audience's relationship to Jolie as an off-screen superhero -- a bona-fide, old-school movie star -- makes her ludicrously competent character seem contiguous with her real-life persona."
0	This is a movie with a massive Cold War hangover.
1	"Salt is a smart, fast, breathless blast of a spy flick that emulates the Bourne films in all the right ways."
1	Thought the recently swapped Russian spy Anna Chapman was foxy? Hah.
1	[Jolie is] probably the most dynamic action star in the movies right now and certainly the most exotic.
0	Crushingly generic.
0	"[T]he limited, forgivable absurdities... gradually give way to a level of pandemic preposterousness that makes Ethan Hunt look like George Smiley."
1	It all happens in such a frenzy of momentum and on-the-fly exposition that some of the more preposterous elements in the story will strike you only in retrospect.
1	Angelina Jolie is one deadly weapon in this breathless political thriller
0	Some of the cheesiest '80s action movies were more fun than this one because their heroes were trained in a technique alien to Salt: a sense of humor.
0	"I can't say if this nicely crafted nonsense will sell as a franchise, but I know that I miss the unpretentiousness of the Bourne movies."
1	Salt is a senseless blast.
1	"The real point is to give Jolie ample opportunity to go Bonding about, which she does with great verve. It's impossible to imagine any other female star in Hollywood bringing such ferocious conviction to the task."
1	"There's still a lot to enjoy in Jolie's performance, and in the undercurrents of ambiguity in Salt, the questions of identity that repeatedly surface in the film."
0	Just one bombastically soundtracked set of crashes and bangs after another.
0	The focus here is less on creating a credible set of characters and motives than on manufacturing an excuse to have Jolie leapfrog between high-speed lorries.
1	"The film is fluff, nonsense and artful tomfoolery, all at the speed of sound."
1	"It's pacy, smart, subversive and knocked out with such verve and attack that you're not in the least bit bothered by how far-fetched it all is."
1	"By no means a classic, but nonetheless a job well done."
0	"The plot of Phillip Noyce's spy thriller is continually and unutterably absurd, yet for the first hour, when Salt goes on the run from the Agency, packs a fair few thrills."
0	"Can an action film have too much action? It sounds unlikely, like a cheese being too cheesy, but here's Salt to show us different."
1	"In the great tradition of summer popcorn hits, Angelina Jolie's action-spy thriller Salt is stupid but fun."
0	Not even the estimable comic chops of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker can lift it above the level of ordinary.
0	A fish-out-of-water story with a bit of a freshness issue.
0	"Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker are supposed to pass for a married couple, but they have all the chemistry of two actors who just met and shook hands moments before the cameras rolled."
0	"Lawrence's recycled observations of the virtues of rural life, his struggles to find something funny about local ""types"" (an unworldly doctor and his nave-nitwit nurse), his ""grizzly encounter"" scene, are painful to watch."
0	"There's no sense of affection. No passion, even when they fight. Their dialogue rings hollow. These two aren't believable and their relationship is a black hole. Who cares?"
0	An exercise in foregone conclusions so dreary as to hardly qualify as comedy.
0	"You know the line about what a bear does in the woods? Not only is that wittier than all of Did You Hear About the Morgans?, it describes the movie as well."
0	"Did you hear about Did You Hear About the Morgans? Really, you don't want to."
0	"There are countless moments throughout the film when writer-director Marc Lawrence pauses for a laugh line, but the jokes hang there for an eternity while Grant winces apologetically, like he's just shattered a dish."
0	Did You Hear About the Morgans? has no room for surprises.
0	"Toss this one on the ever-growing pile of failed Hollywood romantic comedies, and wish Grant and Parker better luck next time."
0	It's not just the sound of crickets you hear watching this movie. It's the sound of dead crickets.
0	Grant has never been less charming and Parker never less fashionable or more grating than they are as Paul and Meryl Morgan.
0	"If you are expecting a pleasant evening of escapism, you will be cruelly fooled. The editor responsible for the trailer is clearly a genius."
0	"Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker ply their cute trademarks (his befuddled British grimace, her la-di-da New York sass) like grim, incompatible partners in a Hollywood business deal."
0	"Clich-ridden, stereotype-stuffed and clunky at every inevitably false turn, it's so bad that star Hugh Grant, usually the most relaxed of actors, actually seems to be in pain throughout the film."
0	"Yes, comedies thrive on broad strokes. But selling Americans lame images of one another as if we haven't traversed the country (if not in actuality, via television and film) is dispiriting."
1	"Mostly it's an invitation to spend an easy 108 minutes with some very likable folks (Grant, Sam Elliott, and Mary Steenburgen) as they amble through a laid-back fish-out-of-water comedy."
1	"A comedy with mostly likable, broadly drawn characters; tart, nonthreatening social satire with sharp enough teeth to leave an impression while not breaking the skin; and well-timed, modestly sophisticated repartee."
0	"Did you hear about the Morgans? If so, you might wish you hadn't."
0	"Sometimes it's unpleasant, sometimes it's insincere, and for long stretches it's boring. There are good parts, too, but they all come in the first 10 minutes."
0	"A painful failure, lumpish and crude."
0	There's a scene where Hugh Grant confronts a grizzly bear and I've never rooted so hard for a predatory mammal.
1	The cast is in such fine form that everything seems funny.
0	"While it fails on nearly every conceivable level, as a textbook case in everything contemptible in the studio system, Did You Hear About the Morgans? is as good as it gets."
1	It's a pity there's no witness protection program for movies that commit crimes against audiences.
0	I grant you Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker evoke charm in the right screenplay. This is the wrong screenplay.
0	"Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker are assigned to a witness protection program, flown to Wyoming, and installed in a one-horse town where there are no bistros, art galleries, department stores, or funny jokes."
0	"Most bad comedies plod from scene to scene. This one plods from sentence to sentence. Grant and Parker stand around as if they're waiting for someone to yell, ""Cut."""
0	The movie is like a car wreck in which no one is injured but the onlookers.
1	"With less edge than soup, Did You Hear About the Morgans? is a proud, plain, rom com."
0	"If you're going to resort to a formula this hoary, you need to put plenty of energy into it."
0	
0	"This ultra-mild frolic follows the 'fish-out-of-water' comedy formula so closely its lack of surprise is almost, well, surprising."
1	"In a silly way, it is entertaining, the mismatch is actually weirdly plausible, and try as I might, I couldn't be grumpy about it."
0	"Parker is better, injecting a note of rawness and authenticity into an otherwise misconceived subplot about adoption. Even she can't fake any curiosity in, yet alone sexual chemistry with, Grant."
0	"Perhaps this new decade could be the one in which female audiences are treated as something other than a dumping ground for the lazy, complacent idiocy that has passed for chick flicks of late."
0	"The cinematic equivalent of throwing buckets of money at a house with no foundations. The worst thing is, and sadly for cinema, this house shows no sign of falling down any time soon."
0	"Writer-director Marc Lawrence's film delivers some halfway decent lines for Grant to gobble up gratefully enough up until this point, but from here on in it gets worse and worse."

1	"Sleeping Dogs Lie -- a/k/a ""the dog blowjob rom-com"" -- planted the seed (OK, wrong choice of words) that Goldthwait wrings tender humanity from disturbing premises, but his scandalously entertaining new satire proves a darker, funnier success."
1	It's definitely got something special to it.
1	I think Goldthwait wrote a terrific script here and I think it manages to stay funny after it takes its rather dark turn.
1	Goldthwait's great visual pun is that Kyle's gawky class picture is increasingly backlit and screen-printed until he's no longer an acne-ed geek but a beatific Che Guevara
1	Lands improbably on its feet after every reckless plot turn.
1	"[A] savagely funny, unexpectedly touching exploration of the human need to idealize and romanticize the dead."
0	"Once the movie shifts gears, it becomes a timid Donnie Darko-like surrealist fable."
1	"At 99 minutes, World's Greatest Dad is a tad too long, and takes its sweet time to get to the point. But its twisted heart is in the right place."
1	Flashes of deadpan outrageousness occasionally redeem the dourness.
1	World's Greatest Dad is a twisted comedy that refuses to let any assumption rest in peace -- including the one that every dearly departed is really dear at all.
1	With a merciless acuity this nihilistic comedy ridicules collective grief and the news media's cynical marketing of inspirational uplift after a death.
1	World's Greatest Dad makes sharp but obvious observations about the social strata of an American high school.
1	"The movie isn't perfect -- it suffers from an uneven tone in the first half-hour, but it claims the one key ingredient a satire of this nature must possess: fearlessness."
1	"World's Greatest Dad, Bobcat Goldthwait's latest garishly potty-mouthed and over-the-top black comedy, blows up every rule of taste, good cinema, and common sense, and somehow gets away with it."
1	"For all of its cutting cynicism, Dad proves unexpectedly moving in its portrait of a middle-aged man leaving childish things behind."
1	"Though hampered by an uneven tone and a disturbing conclusion, World's Greatest Dad is a bold, black comedy balanced by an unexpected sense of humanity."
1	"Ultimately, Dad finds a somewhat unsatisfying and overblown way out of [its] intriguing ambivalence. But that's the only disappointing note in an otherwise smart and observant movie about reckless acts of adult survival."
1	"As a filmmaker seeking to master the art of satire without cynicism, Bobcat Goldthwait might be one sick puppy -- but he's also the sweetest one we've got."
1	"For a comedy about autoerotic asphyxiation, epic deception, and shameless exploitation, World's Greatest Dad is a surprisingly sweet and tender affair."
1	"At times, the film recalls some amalgam of Heathers' and Election,' but its talons don't draw the same blood."
1	"Williams, with a brave smile that belies the toxic environment, emerges with a trophy as one of Hollywood's greatest survivors."
1	Bobcat Goldthwait makes a daring assault in World's Greatest Dad against our yearning to mythologize the dead. But he loses his nerve just before the earth is completely scorched.
1	There's more going on here than the age-old struggle between maturity and its surly teen antithesis.
1	Who could have guessed that a cat named Bobcat could write a screenplay or direct a film as refreshingly sensitive as this one?
1	"The movie essentially relies on the same joke being told over and over. But Goldthwait finds enough clever ways into that joke to make it seem fresh, and he makes you curious to see how far he's willing to push it."
1	"Making Kyle godawful may seem edgy, even authentic. But it's pure setup."
1	"With his delicate mix of sick humor and compassion, Goldthwait is that rare comic writer who can legitimately be compared to Lenny Bruce."
1	"Offering Robin Williams his richest role in memory while serving up a nice cold bowl of shock soup for the audience, World's Greatest Dad is a surprisingly smart and severely twisted dark comedy from comic Bobcat Goldthwait."
1	"Goldthwait's script turns into a surprisingly restrained, focused sendup of the blind adulation often bestowed on flawed personalities once they croak too soon."
1	"The bravest, smartest comedy of the year."
1	"I loved the film's what-the-hell attitude to production values. The cinematography is no better than it should be, the sets are any place that will plug in a production cable. I loved the sourly but smartly inventive script."
1	"Williams keeps his head above water, and a giddy climax recuperates some of the original energy -- enough, at least, to make this director's next project one worth rooting for anew."
1	"This film is bold and provocative, but it's weak at the core. It is the weakness of an old dog trying desperately to learn new tricks."
1	"Goldthwait's pacing is uncertain, and his humour is frequently ""off"", but the sense of risky provocation is compelling."
1	We can't wait to see what Goldthwait does next.
1	"Goldthwait has given it a title that will make some shy away. But don't. It's a comedy about the particularly American capacity to create legends out of the dead, and it's sharper than most."

1	No Impact Man -- the film and the book -- could well end up instruction manuals.
0	How much can we possibly glean from a guy whose idealism can be measured with a calendar?
1	"The family has its struggles, certainly, but even more than a statement about the environment, No Impact Man offers a thoughtful narrative on the compromises of marriage and how this particular couple found a way to meet in the middle."
1	"Finally an environmental advocacy film for those of us who have the best of intentions but a weakness for Peet's espressos, takeout dinners and an occasional Marc Jacobs sale, to say nothing of a dependence on toilet paper..."
1	"The film, like Beavan himself, leaves an unholy mess of contradictions in its wake, but most productively, a great deal of those contradictions are our own."
1	Unsparingly exposes the confused power dynamics of a certain kind of modern middle-class marriage.
1	"You may find Colin Beavan unbearably smug, but at the heart of his mission lies an inconvenient truth: Our consumable, disposable, unsustainable culture is destroying the planet, and there's no way to change that without making sacrifices."
1	"It may not be the greatest of cinematic exercises, and it often feels contrived, but this documentary somehow is enlightening, ridiculous, foreboding and funny at the same time."
1	"It all seems like a stunt, especially since Beaven has also written a just-published book about his experiences, but he and Conlin are an engaging pair who don't let zealotry get in the way of humor."
1	A strange yet riveting portrait of a marriage enduring a year spent making as little environmental impact as possible.
1	"Like reality TV, there are moments of drama that have an aura of awkward self-consciousness about them and incidents that feel, if not staged, at the very least orchestrated, amped up. But you have to hand it to Beavan and Conlin."
1	"This poignant, provocative documentary reduces the green movement to human scale -- and magnifies the size of mountain it's trying to climb."
1	No Impact Man is a very confused documentary that somehow puts its confusion to good use.
0	"It advances important and laudable ideas, but in a cliched, gimmicky way."
0	"It doesn't sound like fun, and it isn't fun to watch."
0	"Amiable enough, though it resembles a marketing tool for Beavan's book about his project."

0	"Clumsily written, mostly in English, with performances to match, the only real mystery surrounding Ghosted is how this soporific bore got made."
0	An elegant but unsatisfying drama of cross-cultural lesbian love triangles.

1	Pierces the senses.
0	"Apparently so personal that it feels as though it were hatched in a hermetically sealed capsule, Boaz Yakin's Death in Love is as ambitious as it is stultifying and deadly to watch."
1	A pretentious and stilted but weirdly compelling blend of sins-of-the-parent saga and horror movie.
1	"Survivor's guilt jumps a generation in Boaz Yakin's bleak family portrait, an incendiary journey back into the psychic horrors of the Holocaust."
0	"What makes pretentious, low-budget-indie filmmakers think the world is waiting breathlessly to absorb their personal memoirs like groundbreaking new recipes for meatballs?"
0	It's not as if we learn anything or feel any insight or catharsis from watching his characters destroy themselves and others.
1	Death in Love is occasionally pretentious but always riveting.
1	"Yakin and his cast are up to the job, but the current they tap into is so charged it proves overpowering. Still, their bravery is commendable."
0	There's something seriously wrong when you assemble actors this good -- and can't believe a single stilted word coming out of their mouths.
0	How do you explain a movie as hermetic and perverse and ultimately repugnant as Death in Love?
0	"Posing as a study in evil, Death in Love is claptrap that confuses bile with art."
1	"Although the novelty of 3-D adds some drama to the contests, your snazzy glasses do nothing to block out the inanity that comes from the mouths of the participants, the play-by-play commentators, and narrator Emile Hirsch."
0	"A relatively unimaginative take on the proceedings, coupled with occasionally bizarre stereoscopic work and awkward narration, causes the pic to bail out more often than it soars."
1	3D adds a little something extra to this movie-length advertisement for X Games.
0	"As a movie, X-Games 3D: The Movie isn't a movie at all. It's a 90-minute commercial for the games, lacking much in the line of drama, compelling characters or story line."
0	"With its self-promoting tone and overwrought voice-over, the movie can seem more an ad for the X Games (and ESPN Films) than a real sports documentary."
0	"What's in the film other than what you might have seen on TV? Yes, it's in 3D, which adds nothing and dims the picture."
0	"Aside from unrevealing sit-downs with a few key players, X-Games 3D: The Movie is mostly an overlong demo reel of increasingly gutsy tricks."
0	"Unfocused and underwhelming, X Games 3D is most notable as a missed opportunity."
0	"This feature is X-treme only in its multidimensional dullness, which is compounded by interviews in which the interchangeable thrillbots discuss themselves and each other with an immense lack of insight."
0	"Although the competitions are undoubtedly impressive achievements in the daredevil arts, as a record of what these mentally tough participants do, it too often feels like a warmed-over energy drink."
1	"Those of us who prefer the winter edition of the X Games -- snowboarding and all that - would be happy to watch a counterpart film to this one, with a bit of snow. Just a hint, ESPN."
0	"This promotion for the ESPN event is poorly written, contains too much hero worship and profiles too many events."
0	"Such dime-store philosophy, coupled with the running commentary from the Games' heinously Spicoli-esque announcers, ruins an otherwise gripping, in-your-face experience."
1	The kicks come from some over-the-top clips and Imasuen's disarming mix of bombast and shrewdness when he appears on set or as a commentator.
1	"The little-known story of Nigeria's movie success is examined in Nollywood Babylon, a fascinating documentary by Canadians Ben Addelman and Samir Mallal."
1	"For all its limitations, Nollywood Babylon serves as an intriguing primer."
1	"Though Aron Gaudet's documentary never quite captures the relieved atmosphere of these homecomings, it does acknowledge the dark side of a cheery platitude: those on both sides of the divide are in need of healing."
0	Gaudet has a hard time extending his material to feature length.
1	The Way We Get By is neither pro- nor anti-war; it's a somber study of perpetually unsettled lives.
1	"Although it has affecting moments, the film can't quite decide whether it's about aging or about the effects of war on the home front, and its modest scale is more appropriate for TV than the big screen."
1	Unfailingly modest and profoundly humane.
1	Aron Gaudet's film rages with quiet dignity against the dying of the light.
1	Bring your handkerchiefs.
1	"Watching them issue hugs produces an involuntary response. You want to hug them, too."

0	"The three parts never coalesce, even if they each have potential."
0	It is very good at stating the obvious but fails to bring new insight to this age-old morality tale.
0	Could benefit from a little less of the balanced historical context and a little more of the movie madness of Quentin Tarantino.
1	"Inspired by the sectarian murder of a Catholic dockworker in 1975, Five Minutes Of Heaven belongs, along with Nothing Personal and Breakfast On Pluto, to the rare class of movies that try to encompass both sides of the conflict."
0	"Early scenes set up the tragedy, but the majority of Oliver Hirschbiegel's movie is set in a TV studio where the two eventually face each other, and the tension, unfortunately, quickly becomes stagey."
0	A feature-length talkathon built on a sketchy premise and strong star turns from Liam Neeson and James Nesbitt.
1	"It's an original movie idea that feels written for the stage, all the more so since so much of our attention is diverted to admiring how the actors act, in roles with a high degree of technical??difficulty."
1	"Ultimately, Five Minutes of Heaven is stronger as a whole than its individual parts."
1	"So many movies set in Northern Ireland are about the Troubles that we might justifiably ask, why another? Five Minutes of Heaven is far from the best of the breed, but it does at least take a new tack."
1	"The movie might have been more tense had it been a little more quiet. Neeson and Nesbitt, however, are so good that narrative hiccups never threaten to lose us..."
1	Two marvelous performances from two Irish actors turn Oliver Hirschbiegel's Five Minutes of Heaven into a tour de force.
1	A director whose breakthrough was the story of a madman's last stand has exceeded that feat with the story of an angry man's next step.

0	Brothers is a collection of strong moments that don't add up to anything. The movie is all build-up.
0	"The aspiration of Brothers is noble. But it can't preserve the intimacy of the original film, and the loosened characters slide into cliche."
0	"Brothers isn't badly acted, but as directed by the increasingly impersonal Jim Sheridan, it's lumbering and heavy-handed, a film that piles on overwrought dramatic twists until it begins to creak under the weight of its presumed significance."
1	"As predicable and cloying as Brothers sometimes is, the cast is fascinating, young actors now possessing the dramatic heft to pull something like this off."
0	[Sheridan] aims for Greek tragedy but ends up with a PTSD melodrama.
1	"Brothers is a powerful statement on loyalty, love and the cost of war."
1	"This is a powerful, disturbing film that explores common cinematic territory -- the ability of war to destroy the individual -- without seeming clichd or familiar."
1	"Brothers has all the right ingredients -- it's made with care, and it works very well. But it rarely finds the raw intensity that the Danish original did; adding a little polish, in this case, took away a bit of the grit."
1	"Brothers is a heartbreaking film that speaks to the lifelong aftershocks of war, and to the powerful bonds of family and of love."
0	"Perhaps it's true that, as some analysts say, generals are always re-fighting the last war. But when did directors start doing it, too?"
0	"This is a corny tale, told with both generous helpings of deli-sliced cheese and a brief stretch of chilling tumultuousness."
0	"It's a combustible (though boilerplate) situation that Bier, once Dogme 95-certified, plays to the hilt. For his part, Sheridan treats it with a turgidness that shouldn't be mistaken for restraint."
0	"Bier's film succeeded on the merits of its actors, and this one offers fine performances by Portman and Gyllenhaal, but Maguire doesn't cut the mustard."
1	Sheridan shapes the drama so casually that he succeeds in making it feel naturalistically unshaped.
0	"As a melodrama, Brothers is passable entertainment. But the film squanders the opportunity to meaningfully portray the impact of war on American lives."
1	"It's easy to overlook a drama like Brothers, with its plain-spoken title and stern subject matter. Don't. The film is gripping---an honorable and beautifully acted addition to the tradition of homefront war stories."
1	"This becomes Tobey Maguire's film to dominate, and I've never seen these dark depths in him before. Actors possess a great gift to surprise us, if they find the right material in their hands."
0	Sheridan seems as conflicted as the Cahills about their virtues and failings.
0	"After watching this movie, I had what you might call Portman Traumautic Stress Disorder, a condition that leaves you twitchy, irritable, and in need of a well-acted light comedy."
0	"An almost-good movie weakened by its desire to have a major impact, as melodramatic material is heated to boiling over."
1	"Sheridan and Maguire orchestrate things perfectly here, running a line of tension through the film that explodes at the end, just as it should."
0	Brothers never fully earns the right to exploit Sam's crucible in Afghanistan and the angry anguish it brings about.
0	"Brothers itself -- a smart, well-meaning project -- never quite pulls itself together."
1	Natalie Portman deserves an Oscar nomination. Tobey Magure in the performance of his career. This is the best movie I've seen this year.
0	"Brothers -- an Americanized re-make of Danish director Susanne Bier's 2004 film ""Brdre"" -- revolves around the Afghan War but also keeps its distance, a balancing act that winds up looking more wobbly than elegant."
1	"Sheridan is a consistently agile storyteller, drawing strong performances from even the youngest actors."
0	"Brothers tries to delve into how war can tear families apart, but only succeeds in showing how miscasting and melodrama obscure good intentions."
0	"It's almost as if Sheridan and screenwriter David Benioff were constructing a pile of old bones for a museum installation, with no live connective tissue required."
1	"In a role without any flamboyant touches, playing what is essentially just a decent, intelligent woman, Portman lends the film dignity, understanding and true radiance."
1	"Brothers shows us that even when our troops do come home, their war may be far from over."
1	"Is it a movie you'll enjoy? Not enjoy, so much as appreciate. Or maybe recognize."
0	"Brothers isn't nearly as unbearable as most of the anti-war pictures of the last five years, but when it comes to members of the armed services, screenwriters continue to lose their ability to think in more than one dimension."
0	A depressing tale of contrived melodrama that fails to make any point at all.
0	"When Carey Mulligan (the breakout star of An Education) pops up in a cameo, you realize how rich the film would be with her in the lead."
0	"Brothers, the new home-from-the-war film, written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan, has been made with obvious devotion and sincerity, and I wish I could take it seriously."
0	A soap opera ensues with more clichs than one movie can survive.
0	"In this plodding the war-at-home drama, a lip gloss-wearing Portman is miscast as a suburban mom. And though Maguire and Gyllenhaal succeed as brothers, Maguire works too hard -- and Gyllenhaal is tragically underutilized."
0	It takes two-thirds of the film for any scene of real emotional truth or power to emerge - and by then we're lost.
0	Brothers is a movie of moments (some of which are fine indeed) that never quite coalesce into a credible or satisfying whole.
0	Like mainstream Hollywood with a weird dollop of painful arthouse drama.
0	The film feels like a spirit-sapping tour of duty: lightweight stars doing Big Emotions.
0	"While Brothers is raw in its realism and loud in its chest-beating, it's still mechanically cold to watch."
1	"The result, wavering between intensity and bombast, is part Eugene O'Neill, part topical TV movie."
1	"Maguire and Gyllenhaal give honest performances, though they don't really convince as blood. Carey Mulligan, our own current darling, makes a brief but telling appearance as a war widow."
1	"As rowdy, democratic and open-ended as a Robert Altman saga, Brothers breathes life into the clichs surrounding traumatised vets."
0	
1	"Although Brothers is not a first-rate film, it informs us about the after-effects of war and is worth seeing while we wait for better ones to come along."
0	"The early scenes promise a potentially novel cross between heist and extreme horror, but those hopes are quickly dashed."
0	Critiquing the filmic technique of this blatant horror franchise-bait is akin to quibbling with the shade of lipstick on a slaughtered pig.
0	"The editing and camera work are self-consciously stylish, as if to say ""We're better than this."" But the human and moral components are shortchanged."
1	A surprisingly stylish and confident high-concept thriller.
0	"The Collector grafts a torture porn payoff onto a heist thriller setup with messy, illogical results."
0	One of the more doltish entries in the torture subgenre.
0	"One trap leaves a woman impaled on a movie screen, producing an image that succinctly if literally sums up a genre's cynicism."
0	"A sub-Saw knockoff that manages to be brutal yet monotonous, not to mention monstrously unpleasant."
0	This is the sort of cheap bilking that separates completists from masochists; the brief suffering onscreen is nothing compared with the agony scary-movie buffs will feel after being so thoroughly cheated.
0	Watching The Collector becomes an experience not so much of dread as big virtual ouches.
0	"If you didn't already know The Collector was written by two Saw franchise hacks, and directed by one of them, it would soon become as obvious as a fish hook to the face."
0	"This is a crass, silly and baffling slice of torture porn -- with the audience being tortured, chiefly with boredom."
1	"It's a truly creepy concept which, inevitably, leaves room for a sequel."
0	Relentlessly bloody and just as relentlessly idiotic deathtrap thriller for the Saw crowd.
0	"Kinda aimless, pleasant and bland."

1	"Subsumed in Canada's vast landscape, Ben finds ephemeral distraction and occasional edification, but not much in the way of great epiphanies."
1	"Since villains so often steal the show in animation, Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru."
1	A fun 3D cartoon about a supervillain who goes up against three young orphans.
1	"Lo, another 3-D animated kid movie demonstrates that cartoon storytelling pitched to young people is the last, best refuge of sprightly filmmaking this hard, hot summer."
1	"The result is pleasant and diverting, if ultimately forgettable, and it's one of the rare instances in the recent history of 3-D's resurrection as The Savior of Cinema in which the technology doesn't dim the screen or distract the focus."
1	You don't need to know more except that directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud are expert are springing surprises from the ingenious script by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio.
1	"Neither as rich in story nor stunning in animation as Pixar offerings, Despicable Me instead settles for simply being goofy good fun, and it hardly seems like settling at all."
1	"Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater."
1	"Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D."
1	"The setup is pure Looney Tunes, and indeed, Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery that was a specialty of the Termite Terrace crowd."
0	"When compared with the ambition and achievement of recent animated films, such as Coraline and Toy Story 3, Despicable Me hardly seems to have been worth making, and it's barely worth watching."
1	It looks so stylish that thinking about its plot is strictly optional.
0	The film throws so much ersatz cleverness and overdone emotion at the audience that we end up more worn out than entertained.
1	What may be the summer's wittiest kids' flick.
1	Despicable Me appeals both to our innocence and our glee over cartoon anarchy.
1	A whip-smart family movie that makes inventive use of the summer's ubiquitous 3-D technology is something worth cheering.
1	"Short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but be likable."
1	"Despicable Me is a joyously creative, refreshing piece of work, right up until it falls into a hackneyed hole."
1	Despicable Me has enough visual novelty and high spirits to keep the kiddies diverted and just enough wit to placate the parents.
1	"Like the best kids' entertainment, this creates a daffy little world all its own."
1	"By taking the ""heart"" part just seriously enough, and in the nick of time, the movie saves itself from itself."
1	"The film is funny, energetic, teeth-gnashingly venomous and animated with an eye to exploiting the 3-D process with such sure-fire techniques as a visit to an amusement park."
1	"Despicable Me is darned cute. I know cute isn't to the lofty level of ""message storytelling"" but it can be entertaining to watch when done correctly."
1	This animated thing pretty near out-Pixars Pixar.
1	The result is a sweet and witty bit of animated fun with both eye-popping 3-D effects and a warm heart.
1	"There's a fine line between gleeful anarchy and wasted energy, and Despicable Me has a wonderful knack for staking out its spot and staying on the right side."
0	"So much is going on in this movie that, while there's nothing worth despising, there's not much to remember either."
1	"Welcome to the on-screen psychoanalysis of Joan Rivers, of which she seems equal parts willing participant and antagonist."
1	"The movie finishes strong, managing to be sweet without being saccharine. It's no Toy Story 3, but Despicable Me is a solid alternative."
1	"It's all thoroughly adorable, and with an overlay that's nearly as odd as Carell's accent: Despicable Me looks a lot like other computer-animated pictures..."
1	"An improbably heartwarming, not to mention visually delightful, diversion."
1	"Despicable Me may not be the most sophisticated kids movie ever, but it stacks up against recent animated fare like How To Train Your Dragon the way The New York Review of Books compares to USA Today."
1	This is a smartly written comedy with a soft emotional core.
1	This is an agreeable confection with a few soft spots.
1	"Right now, any excuse for air conditioning will do. So it's a happy bonus to find that Despicable Me is more than just a heat-busting baby-sitter."
0	"Unfortunately Despicable Me is just, predictably -- eh. And the one thing the larcenous Gru never steals is our heart."
1	"This dark family comedy with its steal-the-moon premise is hilariously over-the-top, yet understandable from a child's perspective."
1	It's an engaging movie that feels to be aiming for -- and happily gestures towards -- the bright inventiveness of the Pixar studios.
1	One of the year's most likeable family entertainments.
1	"When an actor has just hit a career low -- as I think Steve Carell did in the desperate Dinner for Schmucks -- it's a relief to see them bounce back with a performance that clicks, in a hit film that really needs their services."
1	"It is a perfectly agreeable family entertainment, but not exactly original and nowhere near Pixar's great creations."
1	"There are enough dashes of originality and narrative surprises to keep adults entertained, at least."
0	"Another Pixar-wannabe rolls off the production line, reminding us why we should accept no substitutes."
1	moody transposition of a classic psychological thriller/ghost story to the unlikely but effective setting of a London council estate.
0	"The Disappeared makes you jump once or twice, but it's a dubiously overcooked horror-thriller."
0	"Johnny Kervorkian sets up the film nicely, but by the end, your worst fears are realised when it climaxes in the most anodyne way possible."
1	The film is let down by inauthentic dialogue and plotting that unravels rather embarrassingly in the final reel. But the tension is well sustained and Treadaway's performance is full of pallid intensity.
1	"This feature is a little rough around the edges, but Kevorkian has mobilised a top-notch cast and his story delivers more than a few shivers."
1	"Script's veneer of invention doesn't always lift characters or situations above cringe-making cliche. But well-cast thesps imbue pic's social experiment with a fair quotient of believability, no matter how extreme the situations."
1	"Regardless of whether the film is all fiction or all true or a mix, it has a ring of truth about it strong enough to sustain a defy-all-odds finish."
0	"While the film has strong moments and performances, it illustrates the dangers of overly personal filmmaking."
0	"Overall, the pacing feels languid to the point of meandering, relying too heavily on old soul records (and a final eight-track sing-along) for momentum and energy."
0	"[It] has more fantastically blunt, clunky, and downright laughable teen-sex dialogue per minute than anything this side of Larry Clark."
0	"Much of the allegorical force Harel and Sarmiento's film has built up is undone by its utterly conventional, lameass-switcheroo ending, which may be an indication that more than enough virtual ink has been spilled on this subject."
0	"Written by a weirdo named Trent Haaga for no other purpose than to outrage, Deadgirl is part S&M porno, part supernatural chiller, and worthy only if you're interested in how far movies can go before the police arrive."
0	"Despite the involvement of a producer from the BBC's Natural History Unit and the late Paul Newman on voiceover duty, 'The Meerkats' is just another run-of-the-mill wildlife foray."
1	The beauty and intimacy of the material they so painstakingly captured ultimately overrides the mawkish score and sentimental narration.
1	"""Even the wind has dust in its eyes,"" remarks Newman, at an especially weepy bit. Others may have trouble keeping them open."
1	"The narrative lags some way behind the beautiful nature photography and the comical majesty of the meerkat on guard, poking his head above a hidey-hole like a periscope over a parapet. These pictures don't really need any words."
1	"A tight script, smart casting and sharp direction prevail over modest production values in Run Robot Run!, a sci-fi spoof of corporate culture."
1	Run Robot Run! should reassure viewers that they need not fear the new mechanical beings who will soon be part of their lives. They're better off watching out for the co-workers they have right now.
1	"Gimmicks and hyperbole aren't necessary, so long as there's O'Day's beaming face to look at -- radiant when young, radiant and wrinkled when old -- and the sound of that sloe-gin voice to savor."
1	Force of personality and terrific vintage performance clips make a keeper of Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer.
1	An engaging if less than revelatory documentary.
1	"The directors prefer to secure O'Day's due as, in the words of critic Will Friedwald, the only white jazz singer who belongs in the company of Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday."
1	"A high point shows O'Day, in a black-and-white hat and form-fitting dress, singing ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" at the Newport Jazz Festival. That scene alone confirms O'Day's place among the greats."
1	The portrait of Anita O'Day that emerges in this documentary is of a woman who always lived by her own rules.
1	"Alive with improvisational energy and rejecting the conventional biographical format, the film pursues ideas and feelings rather than chronology as it scats through an archival wealth of interviews with O'Day and some of her most inspired performances."
1	"A gentle, swinging film that pieces together her extraordinary life story from vintage performance clips and various interviews done over the years."
1	"Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer chooses from all the existing materials, and is invaluable."
1	"Robbie Cavalina and Ian McCrudden's loving tribute to the great singer orchestrates archival footage, late-in-life interviews and some spectacular music into one of the better bio-pics of recent years."
1	A close-up look at the strange alchemy that is jazz singing -- singing at its most sublime.
1	The incomparable songbird is finally given her due in one of the greatest music documentaries I've ever seen.

1	"Put into extremely limited release by Paramount Vantage after spending years in studio lockdown, Carriers has moments of genuinely communicable horror and thus deserves better than a de facto theatrical quarantine."
0	"This thoughtful, low-key exploration of our darker survival instincts is too conventional and unfocused to fully engage our emotions."
0	"Plays like Zombieland's humourless twin: with none of the gags and, unfortunately, not many of its genuine moments of tension."
0	"Sadly it loses track of its own best ideas, pledging itself to a dreary set of surviving characters whose choices carry no charge."
0	In lacking both subtley and specatcle... Carriers timidly takes its place in the realms of forgettable science-fiction fodder.
0	The movie has as much depth as the single piece of paper on which the script was obviously written.
0	A queasy mixture of survivalist machismo and mawkish piety.
1	A quietly majestic survey of the hard-won successes and instructive failures of the American environmental movement.
1	There's great archival footage (those anti-pollution PSAs with Iron Eyes Cody from the '70s remain quite powerful).
1	A rapturous and enlightening look at the history of the environmental movement in America.
0	Earth Days has a lot to say about the minor victories of the past. It's too bad that the film ends at the dawn of the 1980s -- all but ignoring the most important chapter of this ongoing saga.
1	"Once [director] Stone drops the generalities and starts getting specific, Earth Days improves considerably."
1	A rich trove of news clips and interviews inform Robert Stone's fast-moving documentary about the movement to save the planet and the cultural forces that helped it along or held it back.
0	"Crusty eco-hippies spin random anecdotes about olden times in Earth Days, a turgid documentary on the environmental movement in the 1960s and '70s."
1	"At once regretful and optimistic, frustrated and proud. Mr. Stone has shown us the way; now all we need is the will."
1	
1	"These people, including Whole Earth catalog editor Stewart Brand and 87-year-old former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, are smart and interesting folks who are worth listening to."
1	A surprisingly engaging ecodocumentary about the history of the American environmental movement from the Depression era up to the present.
1	"Earth Days captures those years when through sheer relentlessness, activists broke through to the public and put the mounting disaster at its doorstep."
1	"Yes, the future still looks grim and whales are hunted here as they are in all such films, but Stone spends most of his time tracking something positive -- the birth of the environmental movement in the '60s and '70s."
0	"Honoring the heroes of the environmental movement is clearly appropriate, but getting mired in nostalgia is a dirty shame."
1	"If you're feeling nostalgic for a time when the environmental movement was something everyone embraced, Robert Stone's Earth Days is bound to comfort -- and alarm."
1	"A culture-clash dramedy whose background in Middle-East conflict is leavened with vibrant energy, balanced politics and droll humor by first-time feature director Cherien Dabis."
1	"A portrait of our times painted from an immigrant's mirror, Amreeka should be seen by every American."
1	The thriving subgenre of immigrant displacement dramedy gets a confident new spin from Cherien Dabis.
0	"As it stands, the movie just serves up another warmed-over Ellis Island rehash."
1	"The good humor, generosity, and love Dabis bestows on her characters in this assured first feature are uniquely hers -- the mark of a talent to watch"
1	"Most important, Mr. Dabis knows that home -- what a fraught place! -- is, in equal measures, where the hurt is and where the heart is."
1	"This piquant film brings a keen and serious eye as well as that feeling for affectionate human comedy to this fraught situation, smartly avoiding both stridency and sentimentality in the process -- it's an elegant balancing act."
1	"This slice of American life, as seen through the eyes of Palestinian immigrants, is nuanced, engaging and authentically observed."
1	Stands as one of the most accomplished recent films about a non-European immigrant coming to the United States.
0	"It's one of those movies that plays to the cheap seats, making the racism bigger, the assimilation process rougher, and the family squabbles extra-broad, lest viewers miss the point."
0	"Writer-director Cherien Dabis paints a gentle, often wry picture of human resilience, and Faour and Muallen give solid performances, but there are a few too many by-the-numbers moments."
1	
1	"Does it occur to xenophobic Americans that almost all immigrants, like their own ancestors, came here because they admire the United States? Someone please explain that to Lou Dobbs."
1	"This could be rough going, but Cherien Dabis' Amreeka tells this immigrants' tale with some humor and only a dash of political correctness."
1	"For the most part, Dabis and her actors charm their way through this material, finding absurdist humor even in the darkest moments."
1	"Although the drama heads on a predictable course, Faour brings intelligence and humor to her performance and Muallem, as the smart adolescent turned surly and scared, is likewise sharp."
1	This sensitively made movie is more than dim Americans making terrorist jokes. It's one of the richer movies you're likely to see about average Arabs in America.
1	"You keep rooting for these characters, even as the plot takes a series of broad and overly familiar turns."
1	"The immigrant experience gets a fresh, post- 9/11 Palestinian spin in Amreeka, a film that has all the familiar ingredients but is such a well-acted, winning re-combination of those that we see them with fresh eyes."
1	A good-hearted film about the resilience of the human spirit.
1	"Director Cherien Dabis' debut feature is a surprising, humorous, moving and very human story about a Palestinian family's emigration to Illinois on the eve of the Iraq war."
1	"A feel-good comedy about a Palestinian mother who moves to rural Illinois with her teenaged son, Amreeka is a kind of stealth political film that confronts issues of ethnic tension and American xenophobia."
1	"Amreeka makes its points with gentle humour and engaging performances -- especially Faour, who makes Muna so likeable it's impossible not to cross your fingers and hope her luck is about to change."
0	"Writer-director Cherien Dabis too easily resolves or dismisses the characters' problems, making way for an upbeat ending."
1	You'll end up baffled that a film built on such shaky foundations can end up being so impossibly sweet.
1	The political issues are a little heavy handed but the story - partly drawn from the director's own experience - works best when it focuses on the personal.
0	"In attempt to sustain momentum, the film begins to lurch from comic-book realism to join-the-dots melodrama."
1	"The film is more gentle than harsh, relying on a very fine performance from the charming Faour and settings in Palestine and Illinois that seem very real."
1	"Not a subtle film, but an attractive, affecting one."
1	Glenn McQuaid's microbudgeted debut is a jauntily gothic period spook story.
0	It's rather hard for anyone who has ever chanced upon a Poe anthology on cable and only lasted through one or two cheeky tales.
1	"The movie goes out on a high, but until then, it plays almost like the pilot for a TV series. But it would be a good TV series."
1	"Droll perfs, diverting f/x and handsome B-pic atmospherics ensure a good time for horror fans with a memory past last weekend's slasher remake."
1	"Genre fans will definitely get off on I Sell the Dead, but outsiders might be less enthusiastic."
1	"Low-budget, grubby and gleeful, but with a nice sense of style and apparently an endless supply of dry ice. Points deducted, though, for a too-easy alien-corpse joke."
1	"Movie fans of all kinds will appreciate a film that knows the differences among 'terror,' 'terrible' and 'terribly good fun.'"
1	"A fine pair of grave robbers, (director) Mr. McQuaid and (producer) Mr. Fessenden plunder freely from the movie crypt, unearthing other chomping, glowing mysteries and monstrosities."
1	"Its wit and style, however, are thoroughly modern, as is a hilarious ending that leaves the sequel door wide open. And why not?"
0	"The worst fault visually, probably intended as a charm against the spell of low-budget-itis, is relentless darkness. Pervasive shadows in most shots do not evoke atmosphere, but eye strain."
0	"If it's not actually a good movie, on some level you have to admire the chutzpah of a film set in 1850s Ireland but shot on Staten Island."
1	
1	Peter's lightning-fast script and Loncraine's steady direction steer this road picture to the sunny side of the street.
1	Pleasant and pro-made.
1	"A colorfully written, expertly directed and beautifully acted romp about the early life of actor George Hamilton that is guaranteed to make you feel warm all over."
0	Occasionally diverting but ultimately forgettable.
1	My One and Only has an old-fashioned sensibility making for a pleasantly diverting road movie.
0	"Director Richard Loncraine applies a period gloss to the proceedings, but adds little momentum; the film never gets on Zellweger's batty wavelength."
1	"The movie is filled with fun '50s Americana, and Lerman, it turns out, really does have the magnetism and star quality to anchor a movie, in a way the real George Hamilton might envy."
0	"Flouncing across the country like Miss Piggy, Rene Zellweger makes My One and Only a fabulous bore."
0	"Zellweger isn't dreadful -- in fact, she's more appealing than she's been in years -- but she's not quite good enough. Neither is the film."
1	"Just when you think nothing will break the summer heat, in blows a cool breeze."
1	"My One and Only is an affectionate picture, set in the early 1950s, that coasts breezily on its charm and style."
1	"Despite some clichd set-pieces, the unassuming My One and Only keeps its balance and momentum."
1	A good-natured screwball road film set in 1953.

1	Rene Zellweger plays to her strengths as an unsinkable Southern belle in the safe and breezy 1950s period piece My One and Only.
0	"This is a trifle too sweet to dip as dark as despair -- at worst, we know Anne will learn self-reliance."
1	"This isn't exactly untraveled territory, but director Richard Loncraine makes this potentially familiar story fresh..."
0	"It's refreshing, and let's hope it's [Zellweger's] passport out of rom-com purgatory and into mature roles. Sadly, it is a better career move than it is a movie."
1	"My One and Only isn't exactly memorable, but this little, personable movie is a fine showcase for Zellweger's talents and a paean to the sort of mid-1950s America best remembered in Norman Rockwell paintings."
0	"My One and Only aspires to a top-down breeziness, but at the end of the road it's as foolish and superficial as a suntan."
1	"Basing psychological speculation on a biopic is notoriously risky. All I can say is that after seeing My One and Only, Hamilton's persona somehow clicked into place for me."
1	"Part road trip, part coming-of-age story, the film ultimately reveals itself as a Hollywood memoir, but it saves any stardust for its last moments."
1	"If you have any curiosity at all about how a fellow like George Hamilton became a fellow like George Hamilton, My One and Only answers the question by looking, fondly, at his primary caregiver."
1	"A grand, colorful coming-of-age story with a candy box color palette and a standout performance by Rene Zellweger. It's a great story and a great crowd-pleaser."

1	"The healing odyssey, directed by Michel Orion Scott, provides a powerful look at the complex condition of autism and family dedication."
1	The Horse Boy isn't trying to provide any definitive answers about autism. It's offering intriguing possibilities.
0	"A quest toward an inevitable inspirational destination, continuing the recent trend of using precious theater space as dumping grounds for a-cinematic PBS also-rans."
1	"It recounts a deeply personal, highly subjective and inarguably thought-provoking story of one family's quest for a certain kind of peace."
1	A lyrical and stirring meditation on the mystery of autism.
0	
1	The strength of the doc is that is does not propagandize with a heavy hand.
1	"An extraordinary journey of the heart and spirit, and a stirring testament to parenthood."
1	"The Horse Boy is a lovely, amazing, wonderfully provocative film."
1	"In the footage taken after the healing, we never see Rowan, except when he is happily playing with his new friends or smiling with his parents. Is that the whole story? You decide."
1	The film's particular story serves as a powerful reminder to all parents that a child's unique strengths and personality may suggest the best path toward healing.
1	The Horse Boy succeeds both as a provocative inquiry into the mysteries of autism and as a true-life adventure tale.
0	It's because the premise is so intriguing and the drama is so compelling that the result is so confounding.
1	Its lack of political nous and cinematic ambition makes it seem small on the big screen.
1	This is an appalling scenario for a film that unspools with the ghastly enthusiasm of a Hollywood thriller. But Sturgess's performance as the feckless hero is absolutely stunning.
0	"Nothing new is said but everything said is shouted, as if to convince us that yesterday's headlines are still today's hot news."
1	"Sturgess is superb as the double-dealer, nailing the Ulster accent and conveying the self-disgust behind McGartland's cocky front; Kingsley too gives good value in one of his less showy roles."
1	"It is Sturgess who dominates the film, though, showing us how an ordinary man can get involved in the messy, heartless business of informing, seemingly unaware of what might eventually transpire."
1	"It's a pretty fine film, thanks largely to the performances (and look) of its crackerjack cast, as well as Jonathan Freeman's restless, gritty cinematography and a lickety-split script."
1	"The movie, shot it Ireland, has a gritty, documentary feel and a sharp, dramatic pulse that never really falters."
0	"Proves how easy it is to shamelessly bilk audiences of their empathy with an ""inspired by true events"" credit."
0	Fifty Dead Men Walking provides another example of what happens when mediocre moviemaking meets an interesting life.
1	"What makes Fifty Dead Men work is the story's sheer moral complexity, which dares viewers to sympathize with anyone onscreen for more than a few minutes at a time."
1	"In this film, Skogland, as Kathryn Bigelow does in The Hurt Locker, demolishes the notion that women can't direct action."
0	God forbid anything even slightly suspenseful or significant should happen without revved-up '80s Irish rock blasting over the soundtrack.
1	"Skogland is a crisp and efficient storyteller. She keeps the players vivid and relatively honest, and never shies away from the brutalities."
1	"Sturgess is solid and Kingsley predictably sneaky, but the atmosphere -- scurries through the Catholic/Protestant border, tense stand-offs, spontaneous riots -- is what's genuinely gripping."
1	"A streamlined, adrenalized thriller that is not as deep as it would like to appear, treads a retrospective political tightrope."
1	Jim Sturgess makes a believable cocky lad who signs on for the con; an oddly bewigged Ben Kingsley is fussier and too actorly as his handler.
1	
1	"This risky, rewarding drama blends emotional naturalism with a formal style in the story of its three titular characters -- a young Jamaican-Canadian mother with sickle-cell anemia, an ex-boxer looking for a human connection and a 12-year-old boy."
1	Strong performances and striking cinematography help this first film by Toronto's Charles Officer move with more grace than its heavy-going storyline would have normally allowed.

0	"Everyone quoted here, and perhaps Pray himself, wants to be seen as an artist. But in this economy, those of us who pay for ordinary stuff might not be so inclined to worship this particular art form."
1	"Like a good ad, Art & Copy bounds along and never bores. That's a big credit to Pray's savvy compilation and of editor Phillip Owens' crisp cuts."
0	It doesn't matter how much garrulous delusion the subjects spout. [Director] Pray buys it wholesale and propagates the myth that there's something to respect about getting inside people's heads and rewiring them into mass-consumptive lemmings.
1	"Art & Copy is mightily diverting, for those who don't mind being sold a slick bill of goods."
0	"When all is said and done, Art & Copy is little more than an ad for advertising."
1	"Occasionally Art & Copy becomes an advertisement for advertising -- some of the talking heads are a little self-congratulatory -- but it offers plenty of food for thought. And makes it taste good, too."
0	"It all sounds rather grandiose, but it's hardly a surprising view from folks accustomed to thinking big."
1	"The world may be going Mad Men, but Doug Pray's documentary Art & Copy presents a very different picture of the advertising industry."
1	An entertaining but also oddly naive documentary about American advertising.
1	"They are the giants of modern advertising, and they have some alluring tales to tell."
1	Art & Copy offers an intriguing -- some might say frightening -- glimpse into the world that has prompted a generation of Americans to religiously tune into the Super Bowl just to watch those short movies that sell product.
1	"Pray inserts facts that are eye-popping (the food industry spends $34 billion annually on ads) and alarming (every year, the average child sees 20,000 TV commercials)."
0	"A seriocomic crimer by Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam and Johnnie To that's a diverting, sometimes head-scratching experiment that will mostly chime with Asian movie buffs rather than satisfy general auds as a single, homogenous pic."
0	The cinematic equivalent of an inedible mess where ingredients war with one another and no one has paid any attention to the poor fellow who must consume the meal.
0	The film is made confusing not only by the twisting plot but by the varied styles of the three cult directors.
0	"Three of Hong Kong cinema's top names take turns to direct this batty heist-gone-wrong thriller, which proceeds from stylish-but-incomprehensible (Tsui Hark) through crunchy and violent (Ringo Lam) to just barking (Johnnie To)."
0	"The filmic equivalent of pass-the-parcel on Triangle, a convoluted crime caper about a mysterious gold coin and the luckless bozos on its trail."
0	"The results are messy, incoherent and ultimately three times as tedious."
0	"Little of it however, is genuinely striking enough to suggest a welcome reception beyond the already converted."
1	A convoluted crime caper with strong ethical underpinnings to support its many moods and styles.
0	"A clever idea that could have worked as a novella, the urban-fantasy-cum-sci-fier Franklyn doesn't cut it by the bigscreen rulebook."
1	'Franklyn' has conceptual boldness and visual imagination that set it apart from the pack.
1	It's a convoluted piece of storytelling that repays more on a visual level than on a logical one. But you can't fault its ambition and imagination.
0	"He is aiming high. And yet, to use a recondite and specialist critical term, this film is massively up itself."
1	"The spiralling plot lines slowly weave together with real dexterity, resulting in a payoff that's as unexpected as it is satisfying. A cracking sci-fi brainteaser."
1	"It takes a quarter of the movie's duration to start detecting its drift, another quarter to start caring. The fantastications have a stronger wallop than the realism."
0	"Allow that director Gerald McMorrow's feature debut shows ambition in fusing psychodrama, fantasy and metropolitan romance. Sadly, coherence and comprehensibility have been left for dead."
0	"McMorrow is clearly an intriguing and talented British director but Franklyn is almost impossible to follow, thus wasting the talents of the good cast trying their best to make sense of it."
1	"Franklyn is wonky and self-defeating: there are lots of gauche moments. Still, it's entertaining, and commendable for its strangeness."
1	"As action-packed as his film is, Winans is in no hurry to tell his tale. His pace is deliberate."
1	"There's a rapacious DIY showmanship at work here reminiscent of the calling-card chutzpah Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson showed in scrappier, pre-blockbuster days."
1	"The cutting is hyperkinetic, yet Lee is always in synch with the cast's phenomenal energy. He's in their thrall -- and so are we."
1	"Passing Strange conjures a rare kind of theatrical magic with its emotionally raw, frequently euphoric portrait of the artist as a young man."
1	"Like Lee, the artist formerly known as Mark Stewart possesses a powerful and singular voice, one he uses to express vividly his own unique experience of growing up as a black man in America."
1	"I can't single out a performance. This is a superb ensemble, conveying that joy actors feel when hey know they're good in good material."
1	You'll probably have to resist the urge to stand up and cheer with the onscreen audience during the emotional curtain call.
1	"Spike Lee's Passing Strange: The Movie is basically canned musical theater, but this is one Tony-winning Broadway show that's well worth preserving and seeing."
1	"The invigorating result, zestily edited by Lee's own inside iron man, Barry Brown, is in every way a knockout."
1	"Moving, thrilling and new."
1	"Lee doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to filming live theater, but he moves the camera artfully and edits with an energy that matches the music. And he makes good use of close-ups, capturing the sweaty faces of a troupe of remarkable performers."

0	"What is disturbing is not Harris's self-absorbed insistence that his own emotional hobbling somehow reflects an overarching social-technological pattern, but, instead, Timoner's uncritical cinematic collusion."
1	"Using archival material and footage Timoner herself shot over the previous ten years, We Live in Public would be fascinating by virtue of its subject alone."
1	"On that count, Timoner is correct: Harris is unduly obscure. But was what he accomplished really all that great?"
0	"There must be a reason why, after all these year, Timoner chose to make a movie about Harris. If you figure it out, please let me know."
1	A snapshot of several New York eras that coincide with the Internet's growing pains.
1	We Live in Public looks at one man's experiments with issues of privacy.
1	"Like Timoner's DIG!, this astounding new docu burrows into the thin and darkly funny spaces between artistry and vanity, isolation and community, collaboration and exploitation, sanity and madness."
0	"If anything, the film is a reflection of the Web zeitgeist, where observation comes easily but insight is rare. What saves the documentary from becoming a complete frustration is the sheer, stunning prescience of Harris."
1	"Midway through We Live in Public, one Quiet participant delivers the hard social lesson of cyberspace: ""The more you get to know everyone, the more alone you become."""
1	"Harris, who appears throughout in interview footage, is an interesting mix -- someone with a serious inability to connect with other people and yet at the same time someone with a consistent ability to see the future."
1	This is a remarkable film about a strange and prophetic man. What does it tell us? Did living a virtual life destroy him?
1	We Live in Public is the kind of nonfiction film that seems to have been conceived to prove that truth is stranger than almost any fiction...
1	The big question is whether we're now living in a more pragmatic time.
0	"Mercifully, Harris has now run out of money, but I fear we haven't heard the last of him."
1	"[Timoner's] film - cobbled together over 15 years - has grown so beguiled by its wonky, disquieting hero that it has lost its distance and mislaid all scepticism."
1	"What Timoner has done for sure is assemble another documentary of monumental scope. She has a priceless knack for being in the right place at the right time, allied to a filmmaker's instinct for narrative, and a journalistic tenacity."
1	"Another bizarre, bewitching tale from those that make up life in, on and around the worldwide web."
0	"Josh Harris focuses the lens on himself. You probably have never heard of him. And when the film is over, you may wish you still hadn't."
1	Disturbing yet fascinating...
0	"Throughout, first-time director DeMonaco shows a predilection for white-hot patches of lighting, squeezed close-ups, and actor overindulgence."
0	DeMonaco deserves credit for wanting to do something different. But what starts out as a witty tweak on tired mobster movies eventually collapses into those very same clichs.
0	The tonal idiosyncrasies may grate early on but things coalesce nicely until the whole thing starts to resemble a diverting short story.
1	"If Staten Island, New York is an ode to what it calls ""the forgotten stepchild of Manhattan,"" it is a barbed and quirky one."
0	"Best is D'Onofrio as a gangster turned environmental activist -- he puts on a white three-piece suit, climbs to the top of a gigantic tree and refuses to come down."

1	Kick-Ass offers some genuinely clever observations about the creation of celebrity in a world where viral video clips and latenight talkshow quips can turn attention seekers into overnight sensations (and inadvertent role models).
1	"Kick-Ass succinctly deflates Spider-Man style solemnity: ""With no power comes no responsibility."" It is blissfully, outrageously funny."
0	"Mark Millar's source comic, which I haven't read, is very possibly a smart and subversive treat. But Vaughn's movie is hollow, glazed, and not quite there, like a teenager who has spent too much time in his bedroom."
1	"Vaughn directs with efficiency and a good sense of action while Johnson puts in an engaging turn that maintains sympathy and helps paper over some of the plot's more jerky, episodic aspects."
0	"Matthew Vaughn, former Guy Ritchie producer, co-wrote and directed, and on this evidence is all flash and no flair."
1	"Among the heavy hitters of the superhero genre, it may not be the biggest, but Kick-Ass is definitely the brightest, and it may just be the best."
1	"Great gunslinging cinema creates icons, and the newest and tiniest of them all is Hit Girl."
1	"Perhaps I shouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did: but with more energy and satire and craziness in its lycra-gloved little finger than other films have everywhere else, Kick-Ass is all pleasure and no guilt."
1	"An extremely funny, extremely violent, gloriously foul-mouthed and decidedly adult comic-book adventure that offers the most refreshing reboot of the genre since 2008's Hancock."
1	"Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things, and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos."
1	Kick-Ass earns its name in every way.
1	It will soon be a well-known part of the comic book movie pantheon.
1	"While not all of the elements fit together tonally, on the surface level -- the level that the title suggests -- Kick-Ass does exactly what it's supposed to, as long as you're game for the language and the gutting."
1	"Is it a problem that Kick-Ass is by far the most violent movie ever to feature kids as heroes? Parents should consider themselves warned, though personally, I just wish that the film had ended up a bit less of an over-the-top action ride."
1	"Despite the violence and the swearing, Kick-Ass has something you don't usually see in superhero films: charm."
0	"Never as shocking as it thinks it is, as funny as it should be, or as engaged in cultural critique as it could be."
1	Director Matthew Vaughn has made an action comedy so bloody funny -- double emphasis on bloody -- fans might need to see it again just to catch the gags they missed from laughing so hard the first time.
0	"Crude, bloody and moody, Kick-Ass embraces, at arm's length, its fanboy origins. But maybe they should have decided if they loved these stereotypes, or wanted to ridicule them to death before rolling the camera."
1	"It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big, shameless, audacious, compulsively watchable, irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment."
1	"Peppering an action flick with comedy is hardly original, but the mocking tone and off-kilter vibe set this film apart. It even has a hearty dose of charm, thanks mostly to the most outrageous performance by a child in recent memory."
1	"It soars, jet-propelled, on its central idea of matching a superhero's exploits with the grinding reality of urban teen life and on the aerodynamic smoothness of the film's style."
1	"Vaughn cheerfully mines the queasiness of ... contradiction for satire, but the movie takes the reality of its characters seriously. When good guys die, their loss actually stings."
1	"Kick-Ass stands as an intriguing fantasy of social networking. To achieve superhero status, you simply put up your own Web site, announce it on MySpace and Facebook and you're on your mythic way."
1	"It's as if all the arguments about these hyper-violent films -- why they are so popular, what they have done to our culture -- are open for business in one convenient location."
0	"A bizarre and ultimately self-sabotaging movie that defies categorization, Kick-Ass is at times cheap and cynical, while in other moments is ingenious and strangely noble."
1	"Kick-Ass has punk energy, ace action moves, and a winning sense of absurdist fun."
0	"At some point it becomes exactly the big, boneheaded movie it was making fun of in the first place."
0	"A film about wannabes who use attitude and bluster to emulate their inspirations, this ersatz blockbuster ends up seeming a little too much like its heroes."
1	"It's a star-making role for Moretz, but everyone holds their own even in the face of their biggest enemy: lax pacing that makes this fun film drag and lurch."
0	This is the ultimate fanboy product.
0	"""Kick-Ass"" isn't just broken by its flaws ... It's flawed to start with, a hypocritical mess whose attempts to swagger turn into clumsy stumbling and whose knowing wink blinds it to its own problems."
1	"Funny, unexpectedly violent romp lets a regular kid play superhero for a while."
0	"What do these characters consider worthy of killing and dying for? That a protagonist lacks superpowers is no reason for him to lack motivation, conviction, or purpose."
1	This is the most brazenly funny bloodbath unleashed on the public since Pulp Fiction.
1	A particularly timely story about civic-mindedness and the pursuit of fame.
0	I started hating this movie around the midpoint.
0	"Let's say you're a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the movie does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in."
1	Kick-Ass is some kind of twisted fun.
1	"Everything you've likely heard about Kick-Ass is true, providing you've heard it's profane, outlandish, ultra-violent, shocking, funny and wildly entertaining."
1	"Nicolas Cage is a hoot, a hollar and a fright as Damon Mac ready, a.k.a. Big Daddy. How can he be otherwise? He's a good cop gone mad."
1	"The film has the courage of its genre convictions. It doesn't have even a whiff of market testing. It does everything on its own terms, and in this age of McMansion movies, that's a super accomplishment."
1	"Fast, periodically spit-funny and often grotesquely violent, the film at once embraces and satirizes contemporary action-film clichs with Tarantino-esque self-regard -- it's the latest in giggles-and-guts entertainment."
1	"Suggested subtitle: Iron Man, You Just Got Served."
1	Prepare for amazement: This thing makes Nicolas Cage cool again.
1	A mosh pit of a comic-book movie that dares you to dive into its anarchy.
1	"The film is post-modern surgery into the superhero myth, driving a scalpel into the warped logic of misanthropic killers who masquerade as civic do-gooders."
0	"[It] thinks it's so brave and bold. But it's more like the title character, a dweeb who just thinks he's tough."
0	"If you're going to play this game, you have to keep doubling down. Kick-Ass can't. The fights never grow in complexity; halfway through, the director has nothing to add."
1	"Kick-Ass is ultra-funny, ultra-silly and ultra-geeky, but what Kick-Ass mostly is, is monumentally cool - this is the film the kids will be swearing about."
0	"I know it's all supposed to be tongue in cheek and lots of fun, but frankly this turned my stomach."
0	"When filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick, are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer -- that is, to coarsen and inflame?"
0	I found it mighty painful sitting through all the bone crushing and blood-letting.
1	"Most of the lessons in Kick-Ass are juvenile, but Lordy are they stylishly told."
1	Steinman's high concept is unwieldy and overly ambitious and occasionally skirts reality TV territory -- one of the women even jokes about being voted off the island -- but the shots of the children beaming in the company of these mothers are glorious.
1	"As with all of Mann's films, his enthusiasm is infectious. He comes to praise mushrooms, not to bury them, and long may his frying pan sizzle."
1	"Like Calvin Trillin in print, or Errol Morris on screen, [director Ron] Mann has the knack of generating fascination where none seemed to exist, of carving intrigue from an apparently non-intriguing topic -- okay, a measure of intrigue anyway."
1	A playfully informative look at various types of fleshy fungi and the folks who avidly consume them.
1	Another delightful exploration of well-chosen subject matter that's more richly fascinating than you might first expect.
1	"A starkly lyrical portrait of angry, disaffected teens in the racially tense wake of the actual 1996 St. Petersburg, Florida, riots."
1	"The low-budget, low- tech indie Loren Cass is an example of less being best."
1	"This sharp, gutsy indie is one of the year's great discoveries."
0	"It's tedious, dispiriting stuff."
1	
0	"Wan, trite and increasingly silly."
1	"A cockeyed tale about a Japanese nebbish in suburban America, White on Rice will wring some laughs out of anyone but the most humor-impaired."
0	Watanabe's performance sucks any remaining sweetness right out of this fish-out-of-water comedy; you're ready to call the police once he starts stalking his hot cousin.
0	Bland and only occasionally funny.
1	Popularity of the two stars could make the film an arthouse hit; they're a joy to watch.
0	"Behind all the role playing is a movie that feels uncertain in its tone and style, more exercise than drama."
0	"It does feel very stage bound, very formal."
0	It's overly faithful to the original and to Van Gogh's preferred three-camera setup.
1	"It's the kind of two-hander that relies solely on the chemistry of the actors, both of whom banter, parry and bum rush their way through various left turns with grace. Their pas de deux almost makes up for this threadbare tragedy's no-win endgame. Almost."
0	"Since neither character is ever explained or examined with any real insight, the viewer ceases to care early on. The overriding effect is paralyzing tedium."
1	It's about watching two always-fine actors do a lot with very little.
0	"The film never lifts itself above its origin as a well-meaning, underdeveloped exercise."
0	"A remake of a film by murdered Dutch director Theo van Gogh, it fails to captivate despite -- or perhaps because of -- the frantic acting efforts of Tucci and the normally reliable Patricia Clarkson."
0	"Ultimately, the joke goes on too long -- for the couple and for us -- and the film fades away before the final fade-out."
1	"The movie has a hushed, sensual intensity and formal elegance that leaves no doubt Ford knows what he's doing behind the camera."
1	"For a gentle man who's lost his love, solitude has become a life sentence that simply must end. Firth makes that ache subtly, splendidly visible."
0	"No more than 10 minutes in, the movie already has the feel of an exquisitely preserved corpse laid out for viewing."
0	"As a movie, it has all the life of a boxed pink taffeta sample at Bergdorf that never leaves the stockroom."
1	"Ford is a true visionary, but it's his humanity that gives the love story a ravishing, bruised grandeur."
1	"Colin Firth is devastating as a gay prof contemplating suicide, though fashionista Tom Ford's movie suffers when the first-time director gets swept away in the art direction."
1	"This is the first movie directed by Tom Ford, the former fashion designer, and he proves a born filmmaker with a rapturous eye."
1	A Single Man -- the striking directorial debut from fashion designer Tom Ford -- is so unusually beautiful it would be easy to dismiss it as superficial.
1	"A Single Man proves a film can look and feel like a 99-minute perfume commercial and still register as a poignant meditation on grief, memory, and loss."
1	"Though the deliberate pace can feel slow to glacial at times, the visuals are gorgeous, and the melancholy mood is exquisitely evoked."
0	"A Single Man, un film de Tom Ford, is all art and no direction -- it's a picture made up of visual choices with almost no filmmaking sandwiched between."
0	"While it's impossible to deny the artistic intent of Ford's cinematic compositions, his style erects an emotional barrier between the central character and the audience, resulting in a pace that is at times sluggish."
1	"It's not a particular political bent that makes you fall for George. It's Firth. This is an unaffected, sincere and very subtle performance, the best of his career..."
1	"Like the speck of sand that seeds a pearl, it's the tiny fleck of kitsch at the heart of A Single Man that makes it luminous and treasurable, despite its imperfections."
1	Designer Tom Ford makes a surprisingly successful leap from the fashion industry to the big screen with A Single Man.
1	"Colin Firth isn't the only reason to see A Single Man, but he's certainly the best."
1	"While A Single Man has its flaws, many of these fade in view of the performance and the power of Isherwood's story."
1	"Wrenching and ravishing. ... An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame."
1	"Colin Firth finally leaves Mr. Darcy behind -- and will likely net an Oscar nomination -- with his deeply moving, career-redefining performance as a '60s gay man struggling with death and isolation in A Single Man."
1	Several diverse currents come together in A Single Man to form a good movie and a great opportunity for actor Colin Firth.
1	"A Single Man is more than a pretty movie. It's also a careful examination of love, loss and mourning."
1	"We're always looking for those performances that truly define an actor, where we can sit back and simply watch the talent soar. For Colin Firth, A Single Man is that film."
1	This is a wonderful movie.
1	"Two characters trying and failing to drown their hopes and regrets, and two strong actors refusing to be tight-laced by a director's exercise in style: here is a mood piece looking for a fight."
1	It's a dirgelike odyssey sparked by Julianne Moore's overheated turn as George's best friend -- a welcome respite from Firth's clenched emoting.
1	Just about every sequence and flourish and detail in Ford's film feels and looks right. It is primarily Firth's triumph. But it is not a solitary one.
0	"Ford luxuriates in the details of his period setting, but the movie rarely gets below the surfaces he has worked so hard to construct."
1	"What's remarkable is how Firth, with the smallest of gesture or nuance, lets us see this man's heartbreak without ever letting it burst through his carefully controlled surface."
1	"As Ford's first film, this story, based on a novel by Christopher Isherwood, must have had special meaning."
1	"Firth plays a drowning man who can't yell for help, and it's an awful thing to see."
1	"How fitting that Firth should carry A Single Man, a movie of quiet but potent emotional power, perfectly suited to his singular gifts."
1	"Despite its downbeat theme, A Single Man is ultimately optimistic about the human capability to gradually make peace with seemingly insurmountable pain and tragedy."
0	Ford doesn't know when to quit: A Single Man is too beautiful by half...
1	One of the year's more satisfying films.
1	"In this beautifully tailored drama, content and style have as vital a relationship as George and Jim did. The one would be lost without the other."
1	"His first time out, Ford has made one of the best films of the year."
1	"Ford's eye for period detail is exact; brief cutaways, incisive dialogue, and charged glances telegraph the cold-war paranoia and sexual alienation of the early 60s."
1	"A Single Man still stands as a vivid portrait of life behind a veil, and Firth certainly delivers one of the best performances of the year."
1	"Firth's portrayal of a man repressing his grief while being unable to repress his instinct for love and for life is excellent and moving, while Ford's balancing of depth and surface is precarious but ultimately winning."
1	"The film is an aesthetic pleasure, like being in a designer hotel, reading a deliciously sad novel."
1	"The private tragedy of George is never transformed into the gripping stuff of public drama; his story doesn't become our story. While A Single Man may dazzle the eye, it leaves the heart untouched."
1	"Delicately, and rather brilliantly, Firth suggests how his quiet heroism is mingled with notes of irony and self-deprecation. It is a poignant, deeply compassionate portrait."
0	"After a while, every scene becomes so tweezered, styled and glossed that the whole thing degenerates into a preening perfume commercial. That's one complaint: the other is that a film that should have been so moving is so boring."
1	The kind of confident debut that radiates personality and visual flair while retaining a quietly fluttering heart.
1	"Ford is good, even innovative, in those scenes where he near-subliminally varies colour, tone and texture from shot to shot, in subtle correspondence with the changing emotions."
1	"A Single Man is measured, ironic, stylish and very slight. It would have been much slighter without the performance of Colin Firth holding it together."
0	"The central problem with this pristine, narcissistic film: it doesn't have a cinematic style, it has a maker's mark, a signature that would like to see itself as representing a guarantee of quality."
1	"A Single man is beautiful to look at, exquisitely told and possessed of a rare casual-paced charm that most other film makers take a career to evolve."
0	
1	This is an important homosexual film based on a first-rate novel with a first-rate cast and probably a harbinger of similar movies to come. Many viewers will be disappointed that the movie only hints at intimacy rather than showcasing it.
0	Not Forgotten overcooks just about every ingredient in its narrative chile con queso.
1	A movie that's more convoluted than satisfying.
0	Not effective on any level.
0	"From the start, it's clear there's a riddle to solve...I'm just not sure you'll care about the solution."
0	Not Forgotten is weighted down by obvious creative choices that mar what might have played out like a telenovela episode of Twin Peaks.
0	Contains a plot full of twists that can be seen coming from some distance.
1	"Passchendaele hearkens back to war films of decades past, when patriotism, valour and integrity were presented without irony. But it is infused with the stoicism of people who know it is their job to try to find meaning within an insane situation."
0	Toronto fest opener crudely welds the grisly verisimilitude of Saving Private Ryan to the contempo cultural revisionism of Pearl Harbor but can't forge the disparate tones into a powerful whole.
0	A war movie that can't make up its mind whether war is bad or something one can be proud of.
0	"The scenes may be embarrassing, but at least Gross can't be accused of playing it safe."
1	"As a director, Gross paints in big, emotive strokes, and though his dialogue often feels too tied to historical fact, this old-fashioned, patriotic war movie has its heart in the right place."
0	"It's hard to overstake how unimaginably dreadful is Passchendaele, a First World War drama that does Canada's already ropey film-making reputation no favours whatsoever."
0	"Director-star Paul Gross may have noble intentions, but his film is plodding, to put it kindly: filled with over-scrubbed sets, glutinous tinkling music, and desperately pedestrian dialogue exchanges."
0	"For most of its length the film keeps to the home front, saving its dramatic switch to the Western Front for the final reel, by which point the plot has nailed its rather novelettish colours to the mast."
0	Only Bachchan's customary cameo (temporarily) lifts the spirits.
0	"Despite a great cast and colourful backdrop, Paheli is far from the musical entertainer you'd expect from a big budget project headed and produced by King Khan himself."
1	One of the freshest mainstream Hindi pics of the year.
1	Bollywood buffs and the Shah Rukh Khan fanbase should be well satisfied with this latest extravaganza.
0	Small moments of beauty -- a helicopter landing in a self-created snowstorm -- don't compensate for the overall dullness.
1	"In this painstaking, body-numbing work, finding one perfect leaf fossil is a palpable thrill."
1	"The director, Anne Aghion, likes to fill the screen with the kinds of lonely landscapes that David Lean once used to suggest another kind of desert."
1	"The film's hesitation, lack of rhetorical inflation and commitment to humble observation generate a tough poetry. Ice People sticks in the mind."
1	"With its lack of narration and subjective distance, the film is a uniquely meditative, psychological portrait of individuals who approach scientific exploration with the passion and fervor of artists."
1	"Rashid Masharawi's film is a fleet, dark urban comedy that registers outrage in glancing jabs of absurdist observation."
1	"Laila's Birthday is beautifully shot and overlaid with a spare, lyrical score that lends rueful emphasis to Masharawi's exasperated fidelity to a chronically malfunctioning city."
1	Masharawi's film is a vivid passenger-seat tour of a society perpetually crashing into madness.

1	"'Shank' has a lot more to say than the average no-budget gangland expos, resulting in a film which, for all its clichs, feels surprisingly real."
0	A well-meaning but not always convincing attempt to hoodie-ise the gay coming-of-age drama.
1	"As formula films go, The Bounty Hunter is more enjoyable than most, even if it packs in as many cliches as any."
0	"In The Bounty Hunter, the couple that foils a bunch of tiresome grade-C thriller goons together stays together. Whether or not that's a recipe for love, it's certainly not a formula for romantic-comedy magic."
0	There are no rewards to be claimed for enduring The Bounty Hunter.
0	The Bounty Hunter has little to offer besides some face-time with handsome stars.
0	Silliness prevails in this lame thriller comedy.
0	"Aniston doesn't bring her old A-game to this. But at least she's not quiet and reserved and no-energy, her approach to too many roles of late."
0	"Aniston and Butler can't seem to muster any believable chemistry. A lot of mugging happens, but no magic."
0	"When it comes to Aniston, maybe it's simply time to settle and stop asking her to be The Good Girl anymore -- perky just might be as good as it gets."
0	"Aniston isn't the world's greatest actress, but the main reason The Bounty Hunter stinks is the script."
0	"Butler...is stuck here playing kind of a jerk, so it's hard for him and Aniston to work up much chemistry, particularly as she's busy racing from the law in a pencil skirt and heels (easily the movie's most impressive stunt)."
0	"Tennant aims for a contemporary version of The Thin Man, wedding the banter of sparring spouses with sleuth work. To say that he falls short of the mark is understatement."
0	Does Columbia Pictures know that a reality-television program with a similar name already exists on A&E? Is it wrong to find that show funnier and more romantic?
0	"Note to Jennifer Aniston: stop playing with your hair! That's not acting, it's playing with your hair."
0	"Based on the onscreen evidence, not a single person in front of or behind the camera cared a whit about how The Bounty Hunter turned out."
0	"Yes, it's every bit as brainless as the trailers suggest."
0	Perhaps tracking down the folks responsible for this film should be Milo's next assignment.
0	"Inexplicably, Butler continues to get work in romantic comedies despite his limited range and boorish persona."
0	"This genre has devolved to the point where what I appreciate most, in the end, is simply not cringing."
0	I stared with glazed eyes at The Bounty Hunter. Here is a film with no need to exist.
0	The Bounty Hunter marks a new low and a new genre: the bail-bondage rom-com.
0	"Averagely routine, routinely average romcom."
0	There'll be worse films released in 2010 -- but not many.
0	"Death, taxes, Gerard Butler. Wish them away all you like: still they befall us."
0	"The story of a bail enforcer who captures his newspaper-reporter ex-wife manages to be both formulaic and patchwork, with whatever twinkles that exist between the stars eclipsed by the overall crudeness."
0	"The film is stuffed with these idiosyncratic micro-roles (I loved Siobhan Fallon Hogan as the bondsman's secretary), which prove more diverting than the two main characters."
0	"The latest evidence that, when it comes to romantic combat, we live in a more thoughtlessly brutal age than our ancestors did."
0	"At points, the film sinks below the level of competent: A stupid plot trick early on is so badly edited that it takes another minute to figure out what's supposed to be going on."
0	...plays less like a genuine story than as a series of 'beats' engineered for the cheapest possible audience responses.
0	"There are two parallel stories: Milo's and Nicole's on-again, off-again relationship, and those guys with guns who keep shooting at them. We know exactly how the first one is going to end and we don't care about the second."
0	The putrid result never rises even to the lofty heights of mediocrity.
0	"Someday, The Bounty Hunter and last month's Cop Out will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010."
0	"The filmmakers clearly believe that their tangled storyline is madcap and delightful, but each new complication just serves to make us feel as though the blessed end of the movie is creeping further and further away."
0	"A so-so movie that confuses loving closeups of Aniston's golden highlights with a character, and stripped-to-the-six-pack shots of Butler with a plot."
0	There cannot be many of these back-of-the-envelope-cutesy ideas for rom-coms left.
0	The romantic pairing of brawny Gerard Butler and wispy Jennifer Aniston is a sight for sore eyes but makes for sore brains long before the end of Andy Tennant's rom-com.
0	You know it's bad when a caper comedy makes you long for the Goldie Hawn-Chevy Chase showcases of yore...
0	"Even considered as no more than an assembly-line Hollywood product, The Bounty Hunter falls well below factory standards."

0	"The Cannes Che, probably a film no one will see again, is a big, sprawling, ambitious mess. It's less a grand-opera mess than a beautifully constructed machine whose parts don't all quite work together."
0	The pic comes off as too scattershot to do anything but skim the questions it raises about the nature of the image as spiritual beacon and corporate logo.
1	"A tight, energetic documentary."
1	"Zippy enough, if a little meandering, and spends equal time on the man and the myth."
1	"Film-makers Trisha Ziff and Luis Lopez ask how and why the wisdom of the crowd decided that this image should not merely be a badge of youth radicalism, but an icon of purity."
1	"Revolution is always with us: this week's guerrilla documentary, watchable and well-researched, is Chevolution."
1	"This intelligent documentary wonders how it happened, and how a hardline Marxist keen on political violence became a marketing tool and patron saint of every vaguely anti-establishment movement on the planet."
0	There isn't any clich that writer Vincent Campanella and director Jeff Celentano don't treat with stoic reverence.
0	The whole production feels like a rejected Law & Order spec script writ (slightly) larger.
0	Overplotted and underwhelming.
0	"From its generic title to its overly familiar plot line to its B-list cast, Breaking Point has the feel of a late-night entry on Cinemax, which no doubt will be its fate sooner rather than later."
0	"Both visually and emotionally ugly from start to finish, this empty crime thriller doesn't have a moment that's genuinely worth watching."
0	"After a particularly brutal, attention-grabbing start, Breaking Point quickly devolves into a flavorless stew of murder, corruption, blackmail and baby tossing."
0	
0	Overwrought indie crime drama.
0	"Unfortunately, Che doesn't feel epic -- just long."
1	"All in all, it's a highly worthwhile, professionally accomplished project, but in its obsessive devotion to precise documentation, the film forgets to inspire."
1	A measure of the movie's strength and weakness is its reliance on Del Toro's charisma in the central role.
0	It's not an elegant piece of filmmaking.
1	"In both halves, Soderbergh emphasizes observation over ideology with an eye toward the mundane details of life on the front lines of a revolution."
0	"This biopic of Ernesto Che Guevara starring Benicio Del Toro may have pretensions to be Lawrence of Arabia but, at least in its second half, it's more like Che of the Bolivian Jungle."
1	"Soderbergh's eye for detail builds over time, until the film becomes as layered as some richly leaf-carpeted jungle floor."
0	Meet Che Guevara. Just think of him as Jesus + Abraham Lincoln with a touch of Moses and Dr. Doug Ross.
1	"Mr. Soderbergh once again offers a master class in filmmaking. As history, though, Che is finally not epic but romance. It takes great care to be true to the factual record, but it is, nonetheless, a fairy tale."
0	The whole movie is a forced march.
1	"It's not a Hollywood-style movie - it demands patience and proper attention - but it's a great movie, and rewards magnificently."
1	"While Soderbergh is not entirely in thrall to the legend of Che, this is not the most critical of portraits."
1	"It is far from being a biopic, more a cinematic extrapolation of Che's iconic status, and by that token it may exasperate some. Others will be engrossed by this flawed, sprawling, intriguing movie."
1	"Soderbergh directs like a tactician at the map-table, ever assessing the importance of the next ridge. This is of some interest, but he has overthought it, and muddled the importance of Che himself, who cuts an aloof and reproving figure."
0	Che is a heroic guerrilla project in its way. It's just that these guerrillas get lost in a mist of opaque purpose and ill-defined movie mission.
0	"For all the drama that surrounded them, Soderbergh never gets under the skin of either Che Guevara or Fidel Castro. We can only hope that the psychological dimensions will be illuminated in the next part."
1	"If you discover a lot about the process and progress of the revolution, this is definitely not the cultural hero of myth, breathtakingly bathed in revolutionary light."
1	"He's made a film that embraces the romance of revolution only to shake it off, leaving very little in its place."
1	"It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing."
0	This isn't a biography -- it's a nature show where Guevara is the lion.
0	"For all the movie's narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise -- of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one's total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?"
1	"With Benicio Del Toro delivering a fiercely indrawn and mesmerizing performance in the title role, Che is neither a hagiography nor a superficial character sketch."
1	A richly detailed but emotionally blank account of Guevara's life.
1	"Benicio Del Toro, one of the film's producers, gives a heroic performance, not least because it's self-effacing."
1	You can smell the gun smoke and taste the cigars.
1	"The film's last chapter is arid yet breathtaking cinema, marked by despairing visuals and a climax that withers, not winds, to a close."
0	"If Soderbergh's ambition was to make us feel just how dull it would be to a woods-dwelling communist guerrilla, he succeeded."
0	"In so many ways, Soderbergh's film does the right things, usually by omission. Why, then, does it feel slightly wrong?"
1	"Director Steven Soderbergh's two-part, four-hour Che is part folly and part fulfillment, a methodical if coolly romantic portrait of the most familiar 1960s T-shirt icon outside the peace symbol."
0	"It's hard to know which scene, where the men are tired, hungry and ill-equipped, is more or less important than the others."
1	I do respect Steven Soderberg for taking on this film and giving us a great part one and for Del Toro's performance alone.
1	As absorbing as it is frustrating.
0	"Che, the story of a failed revolutionary, also fails as a film."
0	"In releasing this reverent, meticulous, fascinating but flaccid history in two lengthy parts, Soderbergh committed perhaps the greatest sin of all. He made Che boring."
0	"A potentially great title-role performance by Benicio Del Toro, which won him the best actor award at Cannes, is buried beneath Soderbergh's stylistic tics and a defiant lack of dramatic tension."
1	"One thing's for certain: whether it's a meditation on guerrilla warfare, on Che or on moviemaking itself, you've seen nothing like it and are unlikely to ever again."
0	"There is precious little in these movies to fill out our understanding of what it was that made Che a rebel, a leader of men, and the repository of the romantic dreams of several generations of armchair revolutionaries"
1	"Those who have read something about this will get more out of the movies, but it's not compulsory. I saw both parts in one day and the experience was absorbing."
0	"The Guevara portrayed here has humour but no irony: his commitment to the revolutionary ethos leaves little room for doubt, neurosis, or private loyalties of any kind."
1	"Soderbergh has made two almost perfect war films, more like the Rings Trilogy than The Green Berets."

0	"Alice in Wonderland has its moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement. But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years."
1	"A fantastical romp that proves every bit as transporting as that movie about the blue people of Pandora, his Alice is more than just a gorgeous 3D sight to behold."
1	A really interesting movie.
1	"Burton, bless him, knows you can't CG a soul."
1	"Curiouser and curiouser -- but then, mixing fantasy and free enterprise has always been the Disney way."
0	"Though Burton's film boasts some excellent performances, as the caterpillar says to our heroine, it's merely ""almost Alice."""
0	"The new Alice is casually absurd, off-handed in its violence, and doggedly on message. The movie is not just three-dimensional but blatantly programmatic."
1	"Amid the visual pleasures, the plot additions feel limiting."
0	"It looks like a CGI head trip gone postapocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle -- it droops."
1	"Purists will squeal, but it's a workable and watchable liberty to take with an oft-filmed yet impossible to film novel."
1	"Carroll purists and freshman English majors may be aghast at the change in story, but for those who watched Avatar and marveled at the images but were left wanting by the wooden acting and tired story, Alice is a treat."
1	A wildly inventive film straitjacketed in conventional narrative form.
1	"When it comes to 3-D visual splendors, give me Wonderland over Pandora any day."
1	"Burton, one of the great visual artists in Hollywood history, is incapable of making an uninteresting movie. Still, I'm not looking forward to the sequel promised in the last scene."
1	"Even Disney and a PG rating can't bury Burton's subversive wit. Like Carroll, he's a master at dressing up psychic wounds in fantasy."
1	"Though it has a few moments where you can see Burton's imagination giving way to Disney convention, along with a bit of trademark Burton darkness, the pleasures of Alice are virtually always unexpected."
1	Carroll purists are likely to dismiss this Alice as spuriouser and spuriouser. But who expects a faithful adaptation of a literary classic from Timothy Beetlejuice?
0	The sweetly surreal feeling of those original books has been lost. What always felt like an English garden party gone slightly off has been replaced by the grotesque and the Gothic and the overdone.
0	"In its big-budget extraordinariness, Alice is awfully...ordinary."
1	"Even considering the liberties Burton has taken with the original text, it's tempting to think that Carroll himself would consider him an altogether frabjous match."
0	"It's just hard to know why Mr. Burton, who doesn't seem much interested in Alice, bothered."
1	"So how's the movie? Mostly frabjous. The visual palette is more artfully riotous than that of other Alice films, the performances more zestful."
0	"Combines the heavy-handed clamminess of unneeded brand remarketing with the hateful hollowness of overdone and empty computer-generated imagery. ... With Burton's uninspired, underdone and underwritten version, you only feel like you're watching money."
1	"Burton treats his material with abandon, but not contempt, and he has brought his Mad Hatter's imagination to a new generation who have not yet read the books."
0	"Gone: the liquid reality of dreams and a sense that anything can happen. In its place: another story of quests, destinies, and chosen ones."
0	What a letdown.
0	"One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small, and the pills Tim Burton gives you don't do very much at all."
1	"[Depp's] wide eyes and high whimsy feel a bit derivative of his Willy Wonka (another collaboration with Burton), but he invests so much of his ample energy and instinct in these roles that it's hard to complain."
1	"""Frabjous"" may be a word Carroll invented, but Burton knows just what it means, at least in his own mind. He's clearly excited to invite us inside, and as long as you're open to so much muchness, you'll be very glad he did."
0	It might be time for Johnny Depp and Tim Burton to start thinking about seeing other people.
0	Here's a riddle: What's Alice in Wonderland without wonder? It's a beloved character landing in the rubble of wrong-headed revisionism.
1	"Wonderful visuals, bravura performances and crazy conceits mostly pave over some potted characterisation."
1	"Alice in Wonderland isn't quite the natural fit of director and material that it seemed to be on paper, but most of Burton's recent movies have been far more disappointing."
1	"Its best and strangest interludes assert Burton's skills as a fantasist, as well as Depp's as a squirrely, inventive character actor."
1	"Alice plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails."
0	"""Curiouser and curiouser,"" says Alice in Tim Burton's latest, and for the first time I don't believe her."
0	Its single biggest failing -- an affront to Lewis Carroll and the charms of nonsense literature -- is the fact that it makes sense.
1	"The true three-dimensionality here is the old-fashioned kind -- Wasikowska's fully rounded performance. Throughout the technical razzle-dazzle, we keep returning to the pallor of that face, the gravity in those eyes."
1	A visually imaginative fairy tale that suffers slightly from its predictable course but still manages to wow at all the crucial moments.
1	Burton and Disney have found a glorious way to interpret fairy tales and fantasies.
0	"No knockouts here. No tkos, either."
1	"The trippy tale may divide audiences -- Burton's version remains a children's story, though some may find it too over-the-top and idiosyncratic -- but to Us, it's a visual feast"
1	"Much of Carroll's magical nonsense remains, even if Burton's film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect."
0	"I can't rid myself of the feeling that for all the funkily crepuscular mood that Burton creates, this is a pretty conventional work."
0	"A film adaptation should, of course, treat its source material as inspiration rather than dogma. But did Burton have to get the books so entirely wrong?"
0	"A succession of chases and fanciful combats, more akin to Dungeons & Dragons than to Carroll, leads to a peculiarly truncated climax. The 3-D effects are enjoyable, but the added depth can't make up for deficits in the concept or the plot."
0	You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland - gifted director takes on gaga script - until you see it. Enchantment has gone thataway.
1	"IBurton and Woolverton pursue a message of self-fulfilment, not as vigorously as they might chase a rabbit but to the same delightful end."
1	"You leave the theater with a pleasant grin on your face, but by no means is it as wide as the Cheshire Cat's, and that's a shame."
0	I found myself trying so hard to like Alice in Wonderland that the process of watching it exhausted me.
0	"Burton, once a master of CGI, has gradually become its servant, or at least has allowed the studio to. The madcap ringmaster of Gothic phantasmagoria does not exert his individual stamp on a book one might have thought he was born to film."
0	"The film, overall, seems familiar, and one didn't used to feel that about Burton, which probably means he needs to dig deeper next time in search of true oddity."
1	"It's a workmanlike effort that will enchant all but the youngest children while holding the interest of parents. That, by definition, makes for a worthwhile family outing."
1	"Alice in Wonderland is, strangely, about the movie you'd expect based on the talent involved."
0	
1	It deserves to be seen for another of Hurt's exquisitely observed performances.
1	Hurt's perf gives some dramatic continuity to a production that is more a succession of setpieces than a through-drama per se -- at least until its affecting later stages.
1	"Ruspoli's empathy for the high-and-low personalities that make up our urban web -- personified in Leo's friend-to-everyone, destructive-to-himself charm -- infuses his amped-up travelogue."
1	"Propelled by an eccentric cast of characters and increasingly seamy locations, Fix dashes headlong through Los Angeles with a little charm and a lot of verve."
0	
1	"It's an entertaining and thought-provoking take on a sport, and a lifestyle, whose identity and history is increasingly under threat from commercial interests."
0	"Although the action footage is impressive, it becomes repetitive, exposing the rest of the movie as something of a ragbag. Surfing fans may be more enthused."
1	The sensational footage of surfers barrelling through 50ft waves provides most of the appeal. But Joel Conroy's documentary is full of scrapbook curios.
1	Some awe-inspiring big-wave action.
0	"However much you admire the daring of these young surfers, you soon realise that listening to them yarn on about the sport can become very, very boring."
1	"Slightly waffly paean to Irish surfing, rescued by the always awesome sight of waves as high as the screen, and consummately skilled, tanned blokes turning them into a canvas."
1	"Not a reassuring vision, for sure, and no tourist plug for Dalston, Hackney or Haggerston, but the film's a fair calling card for Johnson's talent."
0	"The problem is that there's no character development, no revelations and no epiphany. The film is merely nauseating."
1	"Gerard Johnson's debut is undeniably exploitative and rather pointless, but enough red herrings get chucked into the mix to keep you interested."
0	"Johnson and cinematographer David Higgs shoot this mundane horror in drab, flat colours, accentuating the invasive intimacy with which we're thrown into Tony's life. The entire screen has the greasy texture of accumulated filth."
0	It's a back-of-the-envelope idea with a couple of good scenes. Ideally it needed another six months' story development.
1	"Gerard Johnson's low-budget streets-of-London downer is nominally about a serial killer, but in Peter Ferdinando's remarkable title-role it becomes rather more about urban loneliness and alienation."
1	"No one could possibly regard Tony as without flaws. It is often rough and ready - but it is most certainly the product of a real and very promising film-maker, inhabiting a convincingly original world of its own."
0	Director Sylvain White and screenwriters James Vanderbilt and Peter Berg strain to achieve the pleasurable mix of cheap laughs and expensive action that Lethal Weapon pulled off effortlessly with the help of its stellar cast.
0	"Staying awake during this ordeal of incompetent, incomprehensible stupidity is not difficult. It's so noisy that you can hear it in the next town. Staying interested is something else entirely."
0	The Losers does a perfectly serviceable job of achieving its low ambitions.
0	"The Losers is the sort of pyro-heavy exercise parodied in Tropic Thunder, and no amount of production polish can hide the hollowness beneath its junk-food high."
0	An action film designed for those suffering from ADD.
1	"If The A-Team is half this much fun, they'll be lucky."
0	"Movies aren't loaded weapons, though sometimes, they do go off when their users aren't careful."
0	"Though they have plenty of lethal weapons at their disposal, the Losers are nowhere near as fun as the '80s action-flick heroes they emulate."
0	"Basically, it's The A-Team meets Rambo meets Mission: Impossible, with a mission that's one part trickiness, four parts blowing stuff up."
1	"Proving that ensemble chemistry can make or break a franchise, The Losers redeems itself with comedic camaraderie delivered by a well-chosen batch of rising stars."
1	"""The Losers"" is exactly what you would hope for from an action film: a wham-bam-glitz-and-glam good time with two-fisted action and brains to boot ..."
0	"Like nearly all action movies, horror films, and thrillers in the last 15 years, a sense of motion is conveyed predominately with editing as opposed to through physical space. The compression of time, distance, and movement into hectic cuts is deadening."
0	"The script is boilerplate, the wit pretty much witless."
0	"There's nothing wrong with style for its own sake, but The Losers works so strenuously to be cool at every moment that it can only be anything but."
0	"Whether you're betting on action or laughs, this is a lose-lose scenario."
1	"Though rigidly formulaic, the movie is undeniably good-humored."
1	"The film is easier to take than, say, Kick-Ass or V for Vendetta, both of which came to the screen saddled with misguided pretentions. No pretentions here."
1	"The movie gets the job done, and the actors show a lot of confidence in occupying that tricky middle ground between controlled satire and comic overkill. It's fun."
1	There is plenty of good-guys-vs.-rotten-apple tension here.
1	"Compensates for the mindlessness of its story by filling it with all kinds of clever, playful, stylish flourishes."
0	"The manufacturer's date might be relatively recent, but almost all the ideas and moves are definitely older than the likable cast members."
0	How dumb is it? You might actually kill a few million brain cells just watching it. Some groups may even want to consider inviting a designated driver to sit in the lobby and eat popcorn till it's over.
0	"The movie, based on a comic book, features a couple of actors who deserve better (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Idris Elba) and some who deserve even worse (like Chris Evans)."
0	"It's strange what a bad action movie takes seriously and doesn't take seriously. Take, for example, The Losers, in which cliches are sacred and human life of no value."
0	The Losers at least has speed on its side -- not to mention a bad case of ADD and camera jitters -- but all compliments end there.
0	"An aptly titled, grossly overdone big-screen adaptation of a DC Comics publication, it is, as though we needed it, another symptom of where we're going cinematically, and a movie that takes bilious joy in its own soullessness."
0	"The Losers is simply a lot of low blows, telegraphed each and every time."
1	"White and director of photography Scott Kevan, who collaborated on Stomp the Yard, have some seriously inventive visuals, which at times are smash-cut fabulous."
0	"The Losers -- co-written by Peter Berg, who made the similarly loud and out-of-control The Kingdom -- makes a whole lot of noise without making a great deal of sense."
1	It was comic booky enough that I just enjoyed it.
1	"As an action fix to hold you before the summer explosions start, you could do worse than The Losers. It's no more than an efficient time-killer."
1	"It isn't half bad: unmemorable but fast and flashy, and less bloated than the kind of action number that keeps John Travolta in Lear jets."
0	"The Losers is a ho-hum scraping of the comic-book barrel, which feels particularly needless with both The A-Team and The Expendables on their way."
1	"Only the strangely coy approach to violence (deaths are nearly all offscreen), leaves an odd aftertaste, but not enough to taint the big dumb fun."
0	It's like being given the finger for 90 minutes.
0	Just endless stunts. Dispiriting.

1	"[Franco's] take on Ralston feels both credible and compelling; few actors could have made us care so much, or disappeared so completely into the role."
1	Boyle is such a gifted director that he overcomes the obstacles and might even match the commercial success of his earlier Oscar winner.
1	"Mr. Franco is simply terrific, and Mr. Boyle's trademark exuberance creates a dizzying succession of images that get the movie not only out of the canyon but into its hero's mind."
1	"Franco is up to every bit of Boyle's challenge, capturing Aron's transition from clownish outdoorsman and party boy to an introspective chronicler of his own impending demise and a visionary lunatic."
1	Boyle turns the near-death tale into a riveting re-enactment that will keep audiences squirming in their seats.
1	"It's a coming-of-age story -- blunt, mythic, gut-wrenching."
1	127 Hours offers a daunting challenge to a filmmaker: How do you rivet an audience when your protagonist can't even move? The answer is that there's an awesome freedom to Danny Boyle's filmmaking.
1	"I have never before seen something yucky on screen make an entire cinema audience suddenly hunch forward and bury their heads in their laps at the same time, as if in some secular mosque for wimps."
1	"Gripping, thrilling, excruciating, inspirational. One of the best movies of the year."
1	"A passionate, bloody argument for engagement with the world."
1	"127 Hours is unflinching in its depiction of what constitutes the ""will to live."""
1	"127 Hours becomes the one-man Franco show, and the actor gives a tour-de-force performance."
1	"There are moments of genius in this film, jumbled up with the kind of excess Boyle can't help but indulge. His response to the constricted task before him is to break out with more unbridled style than ever."
1	"Fraught with tension, yet never claustrophobic, 127 Hours is a phenomenal piece of work in which a fine actor and an innovatively cinematic director join forces to keep you gasping for oxygen all the way."
1	"It's a crazy stunt of a movie, the kind of dare that only Oscar-winners get to blow their goodwill on. And still, Boyle might have bested himself again."
1	"Boyle's skill at wringing physical and emotional reactions from his audience is impressive; watching 127 Hours is, as intended, an experience of grueling intensity."
1	"Danny Boyle pumps every frame of 127 Hours with cinematic adrenaline that declares war on the dull gravity of docudrama. And James Franco does the best, most natural and nuanced acting of his career to date, lacing terror with bracing humor."
1	"In the end, ""127 Hours"" is one man's incredible, unforgettable journey; it took the extraordinary alchemy of Boyle and Franco to also make it ours."
1	"To say that this movie gets under your skin is only barely a figure of speech. It pins you down, shakes you up and leaves you glad to be alive."
1	"127 Hours may be occasionally overdirected, but it's never under-felt... and more importantly, Franco's work goes a long way toward making Ralston's story live."
1	"The setting may seem constricting, but Boyle captures the intensity of Ralston's experience in a swift, agonizing, defiantly cinematic 90 minutes."
1	"Sleek and stylish, harrowing yet heartening, Danny Boyle and James Franco bring their best picture to the big screen."
1	"Boyle's style is never less than energizing, as it manages to keep this incredibly cramped space interesting."
1	"As Franco goes from fearful to resigned to resentful of the spot he's in, we're absolutely hooked."
1	"Like all great movies, ""127 Hours"" takes us on a memorable journey. Which is not easy when 90 percent of the movie takes place with a virtually immobile hero in a very cramped setting."
0	"""127 Hours,"" about an unimaginably unbearable experience, is pretty much an unbearable experience of its own."
1	"The latest from Danny Boyle is actually an ode to survival, a bracing story of man and nature and an exhilarating sensory experience. It's my favorite movie so far this year."
1	"How do you make a movie about immobility? For a hyperactive stylist like Boyle, whose movies are at best thrillingly kinetic and at worst represent death by a thousand cuts, the solution turns out to be absurdly simple. He heads inward."
1	"From such harrowing beginnings, it's rather awesome what an entertaining film Danny Boyle has made with ""127 Hours."""
0	"Shiver-making moments aside, in a important way 127 Hours suffers from the filmmaker's lack of nerve, a reluctance to let the audience taste Ralston's dread and the expectation of a slow, absurd death."
1	"In his impressive follow-up to Slumdog Millionaire, the Academy Award-winning director honors the lure of solitude while at the same time celebrating the beautiful necessity of other people."
1	"Franco is a remarkably engaging actor - a prerequisite here - but Boyle, understandably, tricks up his predicament with a slew of Ralston's imaginings and fantasies and swaddles everything in a throbbing synthopop score."
0	"Aside from an exhilarating opening and a gruesome climax, the movie isn't all that rich emotionally; all the visual razzle-dazzle winds up serving a pat lesson about people needing other people."
1	"It's a movie worth seeing, even when it's barely watchable."
1	"[It] will blow you away -- for its audacity; for James Franco's performance; for the way that, by the end, it leaves you feeling connected to the strangers sitting next to you, and happier to be part of humankind."
1	"Directed and co-written by Danny Boyle in a style that travels from ecstatic to nerve-wracking and back, this is a film about perseverance, strength and the importance of always letting people know where you're going."
1	"Boyle is such a gifted filmmaker that, in his hands, 127 Hours is genuinely -- and unsentimentally -- inspirational."
1	"Boyle has always been an exceptionally stylish director, and, despite its limited setting, 127 Hours is a marvel of visual eye candy."
1	"Danny Boyle can't help but return, over and over again, to material that's heavy on physical pain, mental paranoia and personal treachery."
1	"In taking a Movie of the Week plotline and giving it a technical supercharge, Boyle has restated his case among the front rank of filmmakers."
1	"Franco acts his heart and soul out, as Ryan Reynolds did in Buried, a similar one-man agony opera in a confined space."
1	At its centre is a magnificent performance from James Franco...
1	"At the end, we stagger like Ralston from the dark into the light. We might have both our arms left, but our nerves are just as terrorised."
1	"Boyle's film takes us back to the campfire for a story that is painful and powerful, as well as true."
1	That director Danny Boyle makes us feel the shock of relief as Ralston finally pulls away from his stony prison signals just how immersive a piece of first-person story-telling this is.
1	"It's an incredible performance by Franco, walking the line between what once was enthusiasm but now is manic desperation."
1	Any film that relies on one actor to carry the movie demands a lot of its leading man but James Franco applies a youthful exuberance that makes him so watchable it's all viewers could do not to blink.
1	"[Gilliam] turns a world falling apart into a funky, dizzying spectacle."
1	This film hits a nerve a lot more effectively than either the director's Brazil or The Fisher King.
1	"What's remarkable about 12 Monkeys is that, despite its decade-hopping abandon, the film makes a chilling kind of narrative sense."
0	"In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults."
1	"Willis gives a quietly intense performance, looking like he's trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle in his head."
1	A potent glimpse of doom with a jarringly familiar ring.
0	Overwrought.
1	"As an entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses."
1	A consistently engaging motion picture.
1	"In some ways, 12 Monkeys is the end-of-the-world thriller that Kathryn Bigelow's Strange Days wanted to be."
1	"At one point Cole says that viewing the past is like watching a good movie, 'Every time you see it it's different, because you're different.' 12 Monkeys is a film that will do that, change as you change."
1	"A densely plotted, visually dynamic post-apocalyptic thriller."
1	"Mystifying, intriguing, even infuriating, it shows what happens when an unconventional talent meets straightforward material."
1	"Willis and Pitts's performances, Gilliam's atmospherics and an exhilarating momentum easily outweigh such trifling flaws."
1	"Bruce Willis, in an eruptive performance of startling emotional intensity, stars as Cole, a prisoner tagged for an experiment that may get him killed."
1	"Terry Gilliam's most mature film to date demands rigorous analysis from the viewer. Add to this the director's grotesquely comic hallmarks, and the resulting film is a complex and rewarding fantasy."
1	"There's always overripe method to his madness, but in the new 12 Monkeys Mr. Gilliam's methods are uncommonly wrenching and strong."
1	"Dark and somber like Blade Runner, this sci-fi is a spectacular mess, a convoluted film with too many ideas for its own good, blending (among other things) the virus thriller with the post-apocalyptic genre."
1	"Gilliam gives the material a lunatic poetry of his own, but remains impervious to the requirements of narrative pacing."
0	Neither as visually compelling as Brazil nor as emotionally gripping as The Fisher King.
1	"While all of Gilliam's movies are worth seeing, there's a fair amount of his designer grimness here mixed in with the cabaret comedy."
1	"This dystopian time-travelling sci-fi is a reminder that the director can make films that are visually inventive, intellectually engaging and downright exciting."
1	"The film itself is a little too rough around the edges to fully engage. Fascinating subject, though."
1	"Using Baltimore's dirt-bike groups as its entry point, the film offers a remarkable grassroots look at how the system is broken at the inner-city level."
1	An urban Western with ball caps and bikes in place of cowboy hats and horses.
1	"Set to a lively soundtrack, 12 O'Clock Boys expresses the paradox of the sport -- its surface coolness and inherent recklessness -- as a single, troublesome package."
1	"In slow-motion shots, Nathan captures the riders' pride in mastery and thrill in adventure."
0	Engrossing if slightly slapdash.
1	"This visually stunning, thematically complex documentary will stir up a wide range of reactions."
1	"""12 O'Clock Boys"" packs more life into its 72 minutes than many longer documentaries do."
1	"In this transfixing documentary about a Baltimore boy striving to join illegal urban dirt bikers, first-time filmmaker Lofty Nathan conjures a unique journalistic excitement."
1	The young filmmaker rarely digs beneath the harsh environment's many fraught surfaces. He simply lets his cameras be his guide.
0	"The film's implication, that the rides need to be curtailed, seems obvious; and I can't help thinking that Nathan realizes this, but stops short."
1	Nathan's film defies easy categorization; he's interested in neither telling a fairy tale nor painting issues in broad strokes.
1	"Nathan wisely avoids explicit commentary. He doesn't need it: Coco's angry frustration, Pug's bruised confusion, and the police helicopters constantly hovering above the defiant bikers say enough."
1	"Its rhythm is the jagged rhythm of everyday life, and its primary asset is its unemphatic authenticity, offering a window into a very specific time and place."
1	"It could have romanticized its subjects, portraying them as outlaws and folk heroes. Or it could have gone the way of moral panic. To its credit, [it] does neither of these things - or, rather, it does both, in the most subtle and insightful way possible."
1	"Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance."
1	"[Pug is] a fiercely individual child, but, inevitably, his predicament also symbolizes how poverty can warp a good boy's nature."
0	"[It] spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career."
1	Documentary filmmaker Lotfy Nathan explores the outlaw appeal of an inner-city Baltimore dirt-bike gang through the eyes of a 13-year-old wannabe member named Pug.
1	"A short, pungent, ambiguous portrait of the poorer sections of Baltimore and the young men who get their kicks riding dirt bikes through the streets en masse, popping wheelies and dodging the police."
0	"A big, dumb lug of an action movie, 12 Rounds is fronted by a big, dumb lug named John Cena."
0	12 Rounds is an occasionally exciting but always empty action movie experience.
0	"12 Rounds is the unholy stepchild of Die Hard with a Vengeance and Speed, starring a man whose lack of range makes Steven Seagal seem nuanced by comparison."
0	"The future of vacuous action movies is clearly with the likes of Cena, humans who resemble characters from video games, albeit without the acting chops."
0	"Renny Harlin's 12 Rounds satisfies, on the most primitive level, the expectations for a second-rate action flick."
1	"Director Renny Harlin keeps the wall-to-wall action hurtling along at such breakneck speed, that it's not hard to get swept up in the crash-and-explode craziness of it all."
0	Wrestling star John Cena is the dead weight that drags down this brainless but energetic action picture.
0	Harlin makes good use of both the architecture of the city and of his formidably muscled leading man. But you will probably find yourself praying for this duel's knock-out punch to arrive long before it actually does.
0	"Time for a revenge game cribbed right from the Die Hard series (and directed, hardly coincidentally, by Renny Harlin, who's an awfully long way from Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger here)."
0	"There's something strangely charming about films that are all artifice, explosions, and naked calculation. 12 Rounds is at least honest trash: It never pretends to be anything other than manic schlock."
0	"There's a decent little action movie somewhere inside '12 Rounds': a bit more complexity of character, a few more jokes and a hero who doesn't look like a two-by-four with a buzz cut might have gone a long way."
0	"A lunk-headed, brawling action movie with more muscle than brains and the kind of editing that feels like being repeatedly shot in the eyes with a staple gun."
0	"One long blur of car stunts and digital clocks counting down to detonation - passable for lazy television viewing, but not worth the price of a ticket."
0	"It remains to be seen whether this crude, dumbly entertaining outing will encourage the director to tackle more of the Greek myths."
0	The kind of passable in-flight entertainment you could watch half-asleep.
0	Skip the cop rot - it will damage your brain.
0	Cena has neither the ease nor the appeal of Dwayne Johnson - the one true Rock - and the film's steroidal pastiche of 1990s thrillers (Speed and Die Hard with a Vengeance) is faintly embarrassing.
0	"Apart from the palpably improbable storyline, Harlan shows a massive disregard for characterisation, and so much bang-bang editing that you scarcely know where you are."
0	"Heavy on stunts but light on plausibility, humor, surprise, visual ingenuity or psychological depth."
0	
0	Contents itself with peddling the same crap about pure valor and warrior ethos that's been around since wars were actually fought on horseback-and it doesn't even have the decency to reward viewers a rousing cavalry charge.
1	"It's a rousing movie, but not what you'd call a very introspective one."
1	"... stirring and solid, ""12 Strong"" is the kind of film that might make you think twice about January releases, and spotlights a riveting story in our recent history that many Americans might not know."
1	"This Chris Hemsworth vehicle is is often hammy, but also wryly funny, breath-stoppingly tense, and uncommonly intelligent. Its January dump is a disservice to a promising debut feature."
0	"On its own terms, the film is watchable enough, but it's blunt and stolid and under-characterized, and at 130 minutes it plods."
1	Thor has been promoted to Captain America.
1	"It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
0	"What makes ""12 Strong"" objectionable - and what will also make it appealing to some - is its attempt to induce a kind of amnesia in the audience ..."
0	"If you want to feel good about a war with no end, this one's for you."
1	"""12 Strong"" lacks depth but fulfills its mission to entertain."
0	... the numbers don't add up; the movie lacks a discernible attitude toward those desperate days in America's history.
1	This is not a movie with time on its hands for character development or scrappy political discussions. What 12 Strong does deliver is a rousing tribute to soldiers whose contributions went unheralded for years.
1	"It tells its story, about 12 American special-forces soldiers who spearhead a decisive battle in Afghanistan against the Taliban, with both laudable restraint and a healthy respect for what actually happened."
1	It's a remarkable true tale of great heroism.
0	12 Strong winds up being an almost-good film about some great American soldiers.
0	"More often than not, ""12 Strong"" feels like a sports movie, where all the stakes rest not on matters of honor and duty, but on a single field goal."
1	"A fairly straightforward and enjoyable movie about an extremely complicated and demoralizing war. Its goal is to focus on a small group of heroes, and it shows little interest in the bigger picture."
1	"For devotees of cinematic blowouts and dedicated students of screen masculinity (like me), ""12 Strong"" is premium, Grade A catnip."
0	"In the end, the feat these characters pull off is rousing, but 12 Strong never gathers the momentum it needs."
0	"It might be enough that ""12 Strong"" makes you feel good that the United States still produces guys like this. Too bad we didn't get to know about the real guys and their actual story."
1	"It's not a bad movie, as far as it goes. In terms of context, though, it goes virtually nowhere."
1	"Intriguingly, the filmmakers and their Chris Hemsworth-led ensemble are most concerned with the uneasy strategic and cross-cultural connections forged between US special forces and Afghan militia in their mutual fight against the Taliban."
1	"""12 Strong"" does a good job of telling a great story, about the first Americans to fight their way into Afghanistan after 9/11."
1	"Sans magic hammer, Chris Hemsworth's career as a leading man is spotty at best. It seems he just needed horse co-stars."
1	"Never delves deep enough to examine the larger involvement of the U.S. and those ramifications, but ""12 Strong"" manages to infuse heart and character into this adrenaline-fueled war film"
0	"Fuglsig's feature debut is ultimately less an action movie and more a procedural, one in which incremental gains and minimal casualties are as much as can be hoped for."
1	"Shannon and Hemsworth employ all their uncomplicated masculine charisma, and the war scenes are pumped with adrenaline."
1	Put aside your hindsight and at least you'll be rewarded with some invigorating action.
0	"""12 Strong"" does its best to tell a story of heroism from a dark chapter in our history, but its reality is much more complicated."
0	"Combat scenes seem more interested in the faces than the fracas, missions are undertaken with no apparent outcome, and great difficulties loom and then dissolve like mist."
1	It's all solid from a technical perspective. Where the film could have used more power is in its narrative momentum.
0	"The Horse Soldiers' story is unconventional, and the film-produced by uber-slickster Jerry Bruckheimer-has been shaped along conventional war-movie lines."
1	"Although the characters are all types, the performances are strong enough that we identify with them despite their lack of depth."
1	12 Strong combines formidable technique with a very simple-minded and jingoistic perspective on the American war on terror.
0	It's all very easy: a feelgood war tale from what feels like a distant age.
0	"12 Strong passes by doggedly and in a haze, a theatre of war which gives us back row seats rather than throwing us properly into the thick of things."
0	"Yes, it's intense jingoistic nonsense and full of hilarious caricatures - watch out for US enemy No 1, the evil Arab Mullah Razzan, played by Numan Acar in deadpan homage to Aladdin's cartoon nemesis Jafar."
1	"The action is frequent and gripping, the heroism present but understated, and the sense of tactical complexity has survived the script-writing process, so there is more geo-political subtlety than one expects from a post-9/11 American war movie."
0	"Unfortunately the movie's central philosophical conflict, between the captain and an Afghan warlord, features dialogue like ""Your mission will fail because you fear death."""
1	"Northup's story was a true, terrible thing, and by virtue of telling it, the burdens of all American slaves are unflinchingly realized by Ejiofor and McQueen alike."
1	...a particularly noteworthy advancement in McQueen's already impressive filmography that funnels the cerebral formalism of his earlier features into a deeply involving survival narrative.
1	This epic account of an unbreakable soul makes even Scarlett O'Hara's struggles seem petty by comparison.
1	It's the nobility of this remarkable film that pierces the soul.
1	"Stark, visceral and unrelenting, 12 Years a Slave is not just a great film but a necessary one."
1	"It's not too soon to call 12 Years a Slave a great film-ruined, tremulously sad, surreal in its evil."
1	"In the epic form of 12 Years a Slave, his most approachable, emotional film, McQueen escalates the tension."
1	"12 Years a Slave is a movie about a life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is."
1	"A strong, involving, at times overstated telling of an extraordinary life story."
1	"Believe the Oscar buzz. Britain's Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame) nails the horror of America's slavery shame but also finds humanity in one man's determination to free himself and return to his family."
1	"McQueen and Ridley seem determined to obliterate any lingering Gone With the Wind-inspired notions that the antebellum South was a place of grace and charm, or that slavery was, in the euphemism of the day, merely a ""peculiar institution."""
1	12 Years a Slave is easily the greatest feature film ever made about American slavery.
1	"It's smashingly effective as melodrama. But McQueen's directorial voice-cold, stark, deterministic-keeps it from attaining the kind of grace that marks the voice of a true film artist."
1	Brave performances throughout this magnificent film.
1	"The film truly belongs to Ejiofor, whose big, soulful eyes seem to register so many things at once: Shock, pain, grit, determination, abject despair at times, cautious hope at others - and always, dignity."
0	Aside from a characteristically nuanced lead performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor... it's a picture that stays more than a few safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling.
1	"If the best films hold you in a captive vise, entertain you, keep you spellbound and teach you something at the same time, then 12 Years a Slave is outstanding-brave, courageous and unforgettable."
1	"""12 Years a Slave"" offers no false Hollywood catharsis along with its muted happy ending, because we're not free from the curse of slavery yet. Looking at it, as it really was, is a start."
1	"When a director who never ever blinks takes on a horrific subject, a nightmare in broad daylight is the inevitable result. Welcome, if that is the right word, to the world of 12 Years a Slave."
1	The harrowing 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing period drama for the ages.
1	"It seems certain to transcend the movie realm and become a new reference point in contemporary culture-a defining vision of what slavery looked like, and felt like, in the U.S. before the Civil War."
1	"McQueen doesn't go in for a lot of flash edits or self-conscious visual flourishes to put viewers at ease; rather, he invites the audience to sit with him as he gazes, amazed, at man's inhumanity to man ..."
1	"A film this good, and this quietly distinctive in its style, is always welcome."
1	"A harrowing, unforgettable drama that doesn't look away from the reality of slavery and, in so doing, helps us all fully, truly confront it."
1	"""12 Years a Slave"" works on so many levels -- some topical, some timeless -- that it's almost impossible to count them."
1	"You won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we have here is a blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic."
1	"Channeling the evils of human bondage through the experiences of one weary figure, McQueen has constructed another intensely physical character study about a man trapped in his own flesh."
1	"The genius of 12 Years a Slave is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price."
1	Slavery here is not only a great moral darkness but a sweeping canvas for depicting the emotional deformities of the people who enforced and exploited the practice.
1	"12 Years a Slave is likely the most painful, clear-eyed feature ever made about American slavery. In that light, it almost seems faint praise to add that it will also likely prove to be the best film of the year."
1	"It is Ejiofor - bewildered, sorely tested, morally towering - whose staggered dignity anchors the film."
1	"Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, written by John Ridley and starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, is a necessary corrective to the antics of Django Unchained, not to mention Mandingo and its ilk."
1	"12 Years a Slave, British director Steve McQueen's antebellum Southern drama, sets a new standard in realistically depicting American slavery."
1	"""12 Years a Slave"" is a somber, meditative, almost poetic film that delivers the horrors of bondage stripped down and head-on."
1	A brutally powerful and emotionally devastating film that takes great pains to rip any lingering vestiges of romanticism from America's most shameful institution.
1	Remarkable.
1	"So raw and distressing is this historical account of a true-life American slave, it's tempting to turn away from the screen. Or maybe just cover your eyes for a few minutes of respite. Try not to."
1	"With this powerful, almost classical drama, British director Steve McQueen has made the seminal film about slavery that Hollywood feared to tackle."
1	The film offers a formidable indictment of the cruelty of which human beings are capable.
1	One of the finest historical movies ever made.
1	But the much talked-about 12 Years a Slave is more than a beautifully shot art piece. It's history made violently real.
1	"Other movies and books have gone here, but few so far and with such overwhelming clarity of purpose."
1	"""12 Years a Slave"" lays out an institution so twisted and wrong that its honest portrayal has been avoided for centuries. Yes, it's dark and brutal. It needs to be."
1	This is not medicine for America to swallow; it's filmmaking of the highest caliber.
1	It provokes recognition in us of the very heart of darkness. It makes the unimaginable imaginable.
1	"""12 Years a Slave"" isn't easy to watch, and it shouldn't be; it's one man's tragedy, but it's also the tragedy of countless thousands of souls beaten down, literally and metaphorically."
1	Slavery is revealed for the unrelenting horror that it was. About time.
1	One of the best and most courageous films of the year.
1	12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from.
1	It is a film that necessity and education demand seeing.
1	"The power of McQueen's movie is in its declaratory style: This happened. That is all, and that is everything."
1	"So overpowering is this film's simple, horrible, and almost entirely true story that it's hard to get enough distance on 12 Years a Slave to poke at its inner workings."
1	"Every scene of 12 Years a Slave, and almost every shot, conveys some penetrating truth about America's original sin."
1	"The cumulative emotional effect is devastating: the final scenes are as angry, as memorable, as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer."
1	"12 Years a Slave isn't simply a masterpiece, it's a milestone. This, at last, really is history written with lightning."
1	"The whole film breathes with reality, even while the bayou landscapes are infernalised, surrealised, by a terrible beauty of vision."
1	"One of Britain's greatest living filmmakers offers an outraged, intense and artful examination of American slavery."
1	McQueen's previous films were called Hunger and Shame; there is plenty of both in this almost unwatchably shocking and violent film.
1	"Ejiofor projects extraordinary integrity, even nobility - and he holds the camera magnificently. It's a deeply inward, deeply felt performance, surely a cert for one of the many Oscars this film must win."
1	"It speaks to the courage and resilience of one man, the savagery of many, and the potential, for both good and for ill, in us all."
1	"McQueen depicts the horrific experiences of Solomon Northup, the free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, in utterly unflinching fashion. The film's strength lies in its frankness and avoidance of either sentimentality or Quentin Tarantino-style irony."
0	"In its own saintly manner, it's as exploitative as anything critics accused Django Unchained of being, - Tarantino's eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor."
1	"The film tells an irresistibly powerful story, in a way that does not shirk the horror. It is unbearable to watch at times, but that is as it should be."
0	"A film that, despite its surface simplicity, proves to be riven with contradictions to the point of incoherence."
0	"[A] half-hearted redundancy, which often looks and sounds like something Charles Bronson paid bills with in 1979."
0	A starry cast and glossier production values simply work against the black-and-white original's strengths in this stillborn thriller.
1	"Aside from some character-defining flashbacks, a godawful score and sweat-enhancing color photography, it's the same movie as before -- a divertingly tense yet superficial time-waster."
0	"A tense, paranoid nightmare with a chilly metaphysical overview has been trampled into a blustering, bad cartoon."
0	Making a film about the cutthroat world of Russian Roulette is a little like making a gambling thriller about the card game War.
0	"Gla Babluani's English-language remake of his French debut loses the source's gritty, mysterious gloom."
0	"""13'' is Gela Babluani's American remake of his successful 2005 Georgian-language film ""13 Tzameti.'' He should have left well enough alone."
1	Wildly kinetic actioner possesses a cool classicism.
1	It shows that Takashi could be a great filmmaker if he'd only slow down.
0	Surprisingly few surprises in this classic samurai costumer from Japan's dark iconoclast Takeshi Miike.
0	"Perhaps something important was spirited away with the 20 minutes of footage shorn for this U.S. release, but the combatants are scarcely distinguishable here even before disappearing under layers of mud and guts."
1	"If Miike had to make all of his other flicks to get to this brilliant catharsis, it was worth it."
1	"A classic samurai movie, right up there among the finest in the genre."
1	"""13 Assassins"" isn't just an action adventure with horror credentials, but a study in criminal pathology."
1	"A stirring, unexpectedly moving story of love and blood..."
1	"Visually spectacular, with wide-screen cinematography from Nobuyasu Kita, impressive, full-scale sets and special effects and exhausting, immersive action scenes, ""13 Assassins"" is pretty nearly the samurai classic it sets out to become."
1	"13 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic."
1	"The great thing, typically, about a Takashi Miike film is that there's no such thing as a typical Takashi Miike film."
1	"""13 Assassins"" is a must-see for Miike's passionate legion of fans. But even action buffs who've never seen any of his films before will be drawn in by this masterful exercise in cinematic butchery."
1	Has a mixture of bloodletting and exultation that would make Sam Peckinpah sit up in his grave and howl with pleasure.
1	"The film is built as a long crescendo, opening at a level of considered, Zen-like reflection and ending with a prolonged cacophony of elaborate, town-wide annihilation."
1	Nearly every image is memorable: it is hard to pick out the most mind-blowing.
1	"13 Assassins musters nearly twice as many swordsmen as Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and is about two-thirds as good, although it delivers the requisite genre thrills."
1	"Epic in scope, ambition, and execution, it's a classic swords-and-samurai film with postmodern blood and guts, and it's completely satisfying."
1	Pays off thrillingly with a virtuoso 45-minute bloodbath you won't easily forget.
1	Miike's magnificent 13 mark both the end of an era and the boundary of a genre.
1	"Miike directs the ""village of death"" battle with an astonishing relentlessness: just when you think you've seen the last bout of flesh-skewering, he tips another bloody bucket of slaughter into the mix."
1	What's special about 13 Assassins is a 45-minute battle scene in which 13 heroic warriors take on the vastly superior army of a wickedly sadistic Shogun lord.
1	Kinetic film-making of a high order.
1	"A film, like so many samurai stories (and American westerns) about brotherhood, justice and sacrifice, 13 Assassins is, at turns, thrilling and funny, visually exquisite and emotionally charged."
1	"13 Assassins is a savage, insane movie - in the best way possible."
1	A richly cathartic experience with a wide range of emotional colors.
1	"""13 Assassins"" has what many action pictures need, a villain who transcends evil and ascends to a realm of barbaric madness."
1	"Does Guinness World Records have an entry for longest on-screen fight? If it doesn't, Takashi Miike's ""13 Assassins"" just set it. And if a record actually exists, Miike's film just broke it."
1	"The dialectic about duty may not translate to a modern Western audience, but the savage sword-fighting is to die for."
1	"Though 13 Assassins' setup could stand some tightening, it's all necessary prelude to a spectacular, action-packed final hour where all hell breaks loose and the streets and rooftops flow with blood."
1	One can pinpoint the exact moment when 13 Assassins transforms from vivid samurai drama to insane work of genius.
1	"Familiar though it may be, as samurai movies go, 13 Assassins"" is a killer."
1	"This slam-bang remake of a 1963 feature by Eichi Kudo builds slowly, accumulating characters and themes, then explodes into a prolonged and masterful battle sequence inside a deserted town."
1	"13 Assassins looks at honour from many angles, without becoming simplistic. Ichii hasn't lost his edge after all."
1	"The excessive mind of Japanese director Takashi Miike (Audition; Ichi the Killer) throttles back the gore to deliver a disciplined, refreshingly grounded samurai action film."
1	Everything here is unnerving and uncomfortable to watch - and that sense of amplified discomfort naturally extends to include an eleventh-hour shift in tone from harrowing psychodrama to black comedy.
1	An effective variation on stalker/home-invasion thriller themes.
1	The ominousness just keeps building.
0	The film inspires almost no feeling at all - even the Friday the 13th movies bother giving the bad guy a backstory.

1	"Jennifer Garner makes the transition from cult-fave TV action icon to full-fledged, ultra-charismatic feature lead in 13 Going on 30."
1	"Thanks to a snappy script by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa and an effervescent performance by Jennifer Garner, this romantic comedy has a buoyant personality."
1	"The movie may not be as good, uplifting, or perceptive as Big, but it's one of the better teen girl-themed films of the year, and can be enjoyed by viewers of either gender in any age group."
1	"Once the movie gets going, it's funny, resonant, and magical in the same way Big was."
1	"Just when you think there is nothing left to mine in the body-switch genre, 13 Going on 30 is an unexpected pleasure, a buoyant comedy that will make you feel young again."
1	Whenever [Garner's] on screen you don't want to look anywhere else.
1	"A spirited comedy of complications whose derivative plot is bolstered by worthy messages, quaint '80s nostalgia and agreeable mush."
1	"Amusing, charming and pleasantly nostalgic."
1	"While essentially a retread of Big, what keeps this body-switch comedy going is the director's love for actors, and his refusal to judge them by the characters they play."
0	"As fantasy-formulaic as 13 Going on 30 is, writers Josh Goldmith and Cathy Yuspa ... haven't bothered to work out the sort of details that transport us too."
0	"Garner is supposed to have a teenage mentality, but she marches around with preternaturally good posture and speaks her lines as if she's still auditioning for the part."
1	"Ms. Garner's performance is what sticks with you. She's hilarious, warm and cool."
1	"[Garner] is appearing in her first comedy since Dude, Where's My Car? And she seems to be having such a good time doing it that we can't help but be drawn in."
0	"Unlike Hanks in Big, there's little consistency to [Garner's] character."
1	"Garner is a delight, a completely accessible personality in completely forbidding clothes."
0	"Subplots make the story feel labored, as if no one wanted to confront what it actually feels like to be a kid trapped in an adult's life."
1	"The thirtysomething in me was all, gag me with a spoon, but the kid in me was like, this movie's rad to the max."
0	The movie is as flighty and mixed up as the adolescent girl at its center.
1	A gender-bended Big with a Sex and the City gloss.
1	A film whose far-fetched foundation is overshadowed by the endearing story.
1	"If 13 Going on 30 isn't exactly original, it's still reasonably cool, thanks to Garner's uninhibited portrayal of a nerd trapped in a Sex and the City body, and to the inspired casting of Mark Ruffalo as the grown-up Matt."
1	"A lot fresher than its premise, largely because of the terrific casting."
1	"You find yourself rooting for [Garner and Ruffalo], despite the predictability of the premise."
1	"Provides a lighthearted, amusing and yet mostly honest version of a daydream most of us have had at one time or another."
1	"It's nice to know that, Hanks or Garner, male or female, Big is still an idea that works, 16 years after it opened."
1	"Frothier than the sweetest drink at Starbuck's and deft in the slapstick department, the actress turns a generic female version of Big into a raucously charming teen fairy tale."
1	It's a surprisingly charming and fresh comedy that only becomes painfully saccharine in its last 20 minutes.
1	Garner is so appealing as Jenna ... that she almost makes you forget you've already seen Tom Hanks endure similar travails in 1988's Big.
1	"The lanky action star of the cult television series Alias is assigned a tired playbook in this film, but she finds room to manoeuvre in a performance that exceeds expectations."
1	An engaging and wholly preposterous gumdrop of a film.
0	Often 13 Going on 30's pleasures aren't deep so much as they are the trained responses to a push of our MTV-programmed buttons.
0	"You buy the magic because it comes with the territory. What I couldn't buy was the world of the magazine office, and the awkward scenes in which high-powered professionals don't seem to notice that they're dealing with a 13-year-old mind."
0	It's looking for comedy and romance in the obvious places.
0	"Like a petulant 13-year-old, I'm still pouting over my disappointment."
1	"Like Hanks in Big, and Jamie Lee Curtis in Freaky Friday, Jennifer Garner is funny and endearing ..."
1	"No question: 13 Going on 30 could have aimed higher, but it hits the target at which it carefully points."
0	"The greatest asset is Garner, who invests Jenna with disarming winsomeness and loads of klutzy teen-like charm"
1	"A funny and charming romantic comedy, 13 Going On 30 is a gender-tweaked take on Tom Hanks' child-in-adult-body hit Big."
1	"With its '80s references, it's basically calorie-lite escapism for those who are 30 going on 13 and want to see nice girls get Mark Ruffalo and bad girls wear Chanel and edit Vogue."
1	"Yes, it's just a female version of ""Big,"" and yes, the story is fairly disposable, but gosh if Garner doesn't somehow pull it off."
0	"A few laughs, but the premise is not developed with much comic flair."
0	"Apart from the moment when Garner unselfconsciously flirts with a 13-year-old boy, the film is pretty much devoid of comic spark, and though it seems to have sweet intentions, it keeps sending mixed messages."
0	"As bombastic, shoot-'em-up spectacle, ""13 Hours"" is a visceral, well-paced and often beautiful action-thriller."
0	"A wholly fictitious bus blast had my audience applauding with glee. ""That was for us!"" a character grins. Yes, literally - it was invented for a crowd that prefers fist-pumping to facts."
0	A bizarre mix of war pornography and dour isolationist posturing
0	"The film wants us to feel, as one of the men they protect says, ""I'm proud to know Americans like you,"" but we're never really given the opportunity."
1	"Bay's goal is to put you right in these men's boots, to feel the heat, the fear, the fatigue, the weight of the weapons and the web of camaraderie."
1	The most surprising thing is how Michael Bay makes 144 minutes pass so quickly.
0	"For Bay, the murky context of history isn't worth thinking about-yesterday's tragedies are today's passable action fodder."
0	The movie is a pummeling slog - 45 minutes of setup and an eternity of relentless combat.
0	"All the performances are solid and the facts as Zuckoff's evenhanded book lays them out are adhered to. It's the writing that clanks and, worse, Bay's continuing inability to stage action sequences so that a viewer has any idea who's doing what to whom."
0	"A relentlessly intense, grotesquely overblown and numbingly long account of extraordinary heroism on the part of six American security operators in the midst of horrific chaos."
0	"13 Hours is a movie where the questions are asked first and the shooting happens later, the opposite of Bay's usual modus operandi. Bully for him and bravo for journalism, but it doesn't make for satisfying cinema."
1	"This is the story of a fiasco, one made less so by the fierce and selfless commitment of a few good men whose old-fashioned kick-ass attitudes form the crux of the yarn's appeal."
0	There's a concerted effort to depoliticize the story... but the movie will find a warm welcome in the red states with its simpleminded tale of brave men doing the right thing while the government falters.
1	"Bay doesn't always strike a solid balance between re-enactment and entertainment, but his successes in that regard are pivotal."
1	"The key characters are pencil sketches, not flesh-and-blood, but they serve Bay's purposes, as do the performances."
1	"Lacking in nuance and occasionally plagued by corny dialogue, ""13 Hours"" is nonetheless a well-photographed, visceral action film, and a sincere and fitting tribute to those secret soldiers."
1	"Bay seemingly can't help but make a movie that is loud, brash, nuance-free and more glandular than cerebral. ""13 Hours"" is a movie that stimulates the production of adrenaline, not insight."
0	"It's long, downright dispiriting, enjoyable only sometimes, and yet there's a feeling of authenticity."
0	A cool 90-minute action flick padded out into a lumbering ooh-rah male weepie.
1	"It's when bullets fly that Bay is at his best. He stages the battles well, and builds tension effectively and at times inventively."
0	"There is a good and interesting movie out there to be made about the tragic events at Benghazi and the political aftermath but ""13 Hours"" is definitely not it."
1	"After a string of iffy Transformers movies, Bay reminds that he can do a much better action movie with humans than alien robots: 13 Hours is his best work in the genre since his 1990s hits Bad Boys and The Rock."
1	"Bay may lack interest in basic story construction or coherent battle scenes, but the guy has a preternatural skill at evoking sensation."
1	It marries visceral Hollywood-style filmmaking (a Bay trademark) with sober subject matter in a manner that doesn't trivialize the seriousness of the story it's telling.
0	"Bay works best with chaos. There's no shortage of that here. It's getting from fire fight to fire fight that's the problem, lending the film a video game-like structure that grows repetitive in the back half."
1	Ham-handed but grueling and often effective ...
1	"Bay has a genius for incoherence, and this is one historic crisis that feels uniquely suited to his dubious talents ..."
1	"Sure, Bay indulges some signature cinematic fetishes. But he shows restraint with the slowed-down, sexed-up shots. War is gritty here, not glamorous."
1	[Bay] does well here what he always does well: He keeps the action at full throttle. This is also what he does so annoyingly: He always keeps things at full throttle.
0	"[Bay] is hell on manly banter amid the explosions (""Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi""), and also moments carefully calculated to make you feel the horrors - and the heroics - of war. Emphasis on ""calculated."""
0	"Bay's action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever, but his reductive worldview is also on display. ""13 Hours"" doesn't just lionize its American soldiers, it oozes disdain for everyone else."
0	"13 Hours presents itself as a straightforward war film, but that's the last thing a subject this complex needed."
0	"Unfortunately while Bay has an eye, he's never had an ear, and Chuck Hogan's screenplay is full of clunkers, tough-guy dialogue that seems made strictly for cheap applause."
0	"If they are suffering the fog of war, you are suffering the fog-of-action movie, a phenomenon that Bay is all too well equipped to create, having previously worked on the Transformers franchise."
1	"""13 Hours"" is so macho it practically has a Born to Lose tattoo on its arm. It's a military grade war machine, and it comes in the same way it goes out: with guns blazing."
1	"In 13 Hours, Bay is striving for something more realistic, and less Hollywood, than his World War II extravaganza. To some extent, he pulls it off."
1	"The movie is imperfect and overlong but it's never boring. And, although aspects of its factual accuracy can be called into question, it does a decent job of chronicling what happened that night."
0	"Several critics have given 13 Hours a pass, citing Bay's skill at action engineering. It's his failure at everything else that makes this movie as hard to endure as it is impossible to believe. #helpme"
1	"The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully, that artist will possess at least half of Bay's punishing, peerless craft."
0	It's all so hateful. Hates women. Hates talking. Hates tact. Loves guns.
0	"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a movie for anyone who saw The Hurt Locker and thought, ""You know what would make this really good? If they got six really muscley dudes with machineguns to come in and blow away all the Arabs."""
0	"It's undeniably spectacular in its own juddering, pyrotechnical, Armageddon-ish fashion, but it's also a film that leads a very rancid taste."
0	The title should give you some idea of how long this two-and-a-half hour film really feels.
1	"Everything you'd expect from Bay is here with bells on - the macho provocation, the sound and fury, and the diabolical pleasure in reducing everything to rubble and bloody mush."
0	"Bay certainly has a style of his own, albeit one that again harks back to the 1980s -- an even more cartoonish variant on the music-video bombast pioneered by directors such as Tony Scott."
0	A creepy little diversion that ultimately unravels long before its hero's fragile psyche does.
1	Stamm brings such a deft touch to these tonal transitions that it's hard to believe he directed the dreadful 2010 hit The Last Exorcism.
0	"An empty, efficient thriller that leaves you as cold as most of its characters."
0	Never satisfyingly accounts for how the unseen puppeteer manages to keep a constant eye on Elliot's every move.
0	"The ""Saw"" formula of a mysterious voice guiding our hero through a series of depravities has gone a bit stale."
1	"Darkly funny and deeply twisted, ""13 Sins"" grabs you from its startling opening sequence and doesn't let go."
1	"13 Sins is a smart, stylish picture elevated by fine performances by Webber and a superior ensemble of supporting players, including Richard Bower, Ron Perlman, and Pruitt Taylor Vince."
1	A thriller of starkly economic proportions.
1	"The terrible game of life is boiled down to its essentials in this new film from 26-year-old Georgian director Gela Babluani, who makes a stunning debut with what might yet become a classic."
1	An intense and claustrophobic thriller.
1	"As a brutal metaphor for the global economy, 13 Tzameti takes care of business; its assertion that desperate means require desperate measures naturally extends to the hair-trigger world of genre filmmaking."
1	13 Tzameti flaunts a grim sense of the absurd that suggests a French new wave film infected with a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism.
1	By the end ... audiences will need mass manicures.
1	"In a way, 13 (Tzameti) is a nearly gore-free take on Hostel, another film ... about desperate attempts to survive in a place that's simultaneously culturally and geographically alien."
1	You can almost smell the nervous sweat running down these men's backs. You can almost feel the damp.
1	"Starts slowly but builds, Hitchcock-style, to a terrifying crescendo."
1	The resulting jolts add up to one unforgettably surreal nightmare.
0	"French art thriller 13 Tzameti has a literal hair-trigger premise, yet it's so lacking in human dimensions that it creates virtually no suspense."
1	"That calmness -- and the work of both Babluani brothers is weirdly stilled and mature, already devoid of the need to show off -- serves only to thicken the horror."
1	"Although it's likely too stark for everyone, 13 Tzameti offers a mind-blowing experience for anyone willing to go along for the ride."
0	... little substance and lots of fashionable cynicism.
0	Get the picture? I didn't.
0	The first film by a 26-year-old director (Gela Babluani) that feels like the worst of what a 26-year-old director could make.
1	Demands to be seen for the juice it manages to wring out of its central gambit but mostly for the directorial career it hints is on the horizon.
1	"The film is exquisitely simple, and exceptionally tough, and its monochromatic visuals -- and cast of fascinating, hard-bitten faces -- make it impossible not to watch, even when events become close to unbearable."
1	"[Babluani] creates a fear so bottomless, a bad dream so plausible that its hooks tear into your consciousness."
0	"13 (Tzameti) might seem allegorical, but it's too cynically concerned with what works as entertainment to offer larger truths about human existence."
1	The Babluanis are brothers to pay attention to.
1	"Gela Babluani, according to the film's sparse press kit, is only 26 years old but already knows more about suspense than some filmmakers learn in a career."
1	The Georgian-born French director Gela Babluani makes an absorbing debut with this black-and-white thriller.
0	"It may be smarter than Saw II or Saw III, but it's just selling a classier brand of sadistic voyeurism."
1	"Easier to admire than it is to sit through, the French film 13 (Tzameti) is an exercise in stylish depravity that may one day be viewed as the debut of a great filmmaker."
1	"A tightly screwed shocker, a suspense tour de force that proceeds through a harrowing chain of events with alarming confidence."
0	The 13th Warrior seems like a made-for-TV warrior movie without enough money to get really epic.
0	"Loaded with potential, it's puzzlingly overblown and distant, as if its huge budget were an albatross around its neck."
0	It's little more than a shoddy string of action-movie cliches.
0	"With the possible exception of the action sequences and the very occasionally imaginative set design, it's awful."
0	The 13th Warrior indulges in enough grubby histrionics and costume-adventure clichs to give you fifth-grade flashbacks.
0	"A mud-stained, blood-soaked and completely useless movie."
0	
0	The film feels as hollow as empty armor and slightly hackneyed.
0	"With a budget said to be more than $100 million, it displays a lot of cash on the screen, but little thought."
1	"If the juiciest bouts of professional wrestling on television leave you feeling unfulfilled and pining for the primal howls of fight - to - the - death combat, The 13th Warrior just might be the answer to your prayers."
1	An exhilarating 100 minutes!
0	It falls short where it counts: in the final confrontation.
1	"The most unexpectedly audacious, exhilarating, and wildly creative adventure thriller I have seen in ages!"
1	The 13th Warrior is a kick in the 10th century.
1	"Actually a well-marbled, albeit derivative, slab of action-movie man meat."
1	"As movies about Norsemen go, it's not as witty as The Vikings with Kirk Douglas, but it holds your attention through sheer cinematic power."
1	A big cathartic blast.
0	"The film is fascinating to watch, but I can hardly say what it's about, other than people killing each other."
0	"At its best, this achieves the beauty and grandeur of a Kurosawa epic -- at its worst, however, it feels like a Python remake of The Vikings."
0	"Michael Crichton's story is underdeveloped and narrow in range, resulting in a tale more curious for its odd confluence of elements than for their edifying deployment."
0	Akira Kurosawa's brilliant samurai movies -- especially 1957's Throne of Blood -- are a visual influence. But the script lacks the dignity that infuses Kurosawa's equally blood-thirsty characters.
1	Reassuringly old-school gothic.
1	"Refuses to embrace the fashionable elements of torture porn that are currently cutting a bloody swath through the horror genre, relying largely on psychological terror to impart the sense of someone possibly going mad, and taking the viewer along."
1	"This isn't a horror movie about... screams and yells, it's more like chills and little moments of revelation."
1	"1408 generally survives and thrives on the strength of John Cusack's passionate performance as a skeptic of the supernatural who learns that spooks may be real, + a spirited supporting role by Samuel L. Jackson and some effective chills."
1	"Cusack manages to summon deep wellsprings of personal grief along with breezy humor and naked animal terror. It's a tour de force performance that confirms the talents of this remarkably versatile, sometimes underrated actor."
1	"Quaint or not, this King adaptation chills, and may have you Googling the next hotel you're scheduled to check into, room by room."
0	"Regardless of how long you last in 1408, the logic to which you are entitled never comes."
1	"The horror wouldn't work without Cusack, who makes what could have been a rote acting exercise -- Be tough! Now angry! Now defensively funny! -- a cathartic ritual instead."
1	A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way once the scary stuff gets going.
0	1408 amounts to little more than a radical shock-therapy session for a man still finding his way after the loss of his daughter. Best to leave him alone with his issues.
1	"Swedish director Mikael Hafsrom, who scored with Evil in 2003 and fizzled badly with Derailed two years later, seems to have regained his footing."
1	"The story features some surprises, and director Mikael Hfstrm adds realism by bypassing computer graphics for practical effects. Add in the natural fear of being trapped in tight spaces and you have a can't-miss formula for horror and suspense."
1	"1408 is not quite interesting enough to linger long in the mind, but it has enough jack-in-the-box chills to mollify those who feel it's been all downhill since The Uninvited."
1	"Adapted from a Stephen King story, this trite but watchable chiller plays like a scaled-down version of The Shining, with Cusack driven over the edge by hallucinations of his abusive father and dead daughter."
1	"It's a good, solid scare picture, modestly scaled but well-crafted. And unlike certain other horror items on offer right now, this one doesn't make you feel like a psycho-in-training for sitting through it."
1	"Listen up, all you Hostels, Saws and other purveyors of bloody terror. Lay down your whips, chain saws and paring knives to watch a truly scary movie."
1	"Based on a Stephen King story, 1408 takes the simplest plot and turns it into an enjoyably surreal, unnerving creepfest."
0	"The movie attempts a false ending that doesn't quite work; the picture feels prolonged, dragged out, and its ennui lessens the impact of some of its more terrifying fillips."
1	A faithful and creepy adaptation of [King's] 2002 short story.
0	"Even as haunted hotel King movies go, 1408 is certainly no Shining. Not even the TV-movie version."
1	A genuinely disturbing and ingenious piece of horror that's as much a brainteaser as it is a feast of visual creativity.
1	"1408 is one of the good Stephen King adaptations, one that maintains its author's sly sense of humor and satiric view of human nature."
1	"An entertainingly hairy paranormal affair based on a King short story, 1408 sets up its star -- and its audience -- for a blood-curdling, bone-chilling night of horror."
0	There's ghoulish fun and Hichcockian suspense until the film hits a narrative wall around the 60-minute mark.
1	"If I ever check into a hotel room and the clock radio is playing the Carpenters, I'm going to freak out."
0	"In this mix of recycled scares and half-hearted twists, the only real fright is the sight of an interesting actor wasting his talents in yet another mediocre movie."
1	"With a minimal amount of blood and virtually no gore, 1408 still manages to give you a major case of the creep-outs."
0	"You might say 1408 has a 1409 ending -- beige, humdrum, only mildly uncomfortable and, once passed through on the journey home, instantly forgettable."
1	"You would assume that Stephen King had wrung about all the neurosis that could be squeezed from the haunted-writer theme in Secret Window, Misery and, most famously, The Shining. You would, however, be wrong -- dead wrong."
1	A psychologically thrilling movie that leaves you gasping in the end.
1	"All the suspense and shock depends on [Cusack's] performance, how he reacts from minute to minute, and he does a terrific job under Mikael Hafstrom's direction."
0	The problem with this movie is that it feels too much like a joke rather than a true work of suspense.
1	"Virtually a one-man show by Cusack, and he's up to the task."
1	"A Stephen King short story is adapted and brought to the screen in 1408, more psychological thriller than outright horror."
1	It reminds us what it's like to be scared in a theater rather than overwhelmed by buckets of blood and gore.
1	"Things certainly go bump in the night in this slow-burning Stephen King adaptation. But 1408's short story origins are very clear: think a long, if enjoyable, episode of The Twilight Zone."
0	You leave the film once again feeling that Stephen King is either not quite as good as his reputation or that most film-makers can't replicate the subtleties of his style.
1	"John Cusack's edgy, likeable performance carries this paranormal chiller, based on a Stephen King story and highly reminiscent of his landmark shockfest The Shining."
1	"Cusack, who is in almost every scene, is astutely cast: his sardonic persona gradually disintegrates as the room plays its malevolent tricks on him."
0	"It all rather sidesteps the question of why reluctant manager Samuel L.?Jackson fails to demand a written disclaimer from a guest insisting on a room that has seen 56 deaths, including drowning in chicken soup."
1	Unpretentious and effective.
1	"Even if by the closing act the movie has begun to feel a bit preposterous (enter the giant sea storm) and the resolution a bit saccharine, that's a small price to pay for a movie that's trying hard to reinvent horror the old-fashioned way."
1	Cusack always manages to underscore panic with irony.

1	"Depardieu lends it gravity, the supporting performances are convincing, the locations are realistic, and we are inspired to reflect that it did indeed take a certain nerve to sail off into nowhere just because an orange was round."
0	Here's a one-word review of 1492: hubris.
0	
0	"Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise is a long, becalmed and hollow hull of a movie about the old order bumping into the New World."
0	This $50 million spectacle must be one of the least entertaining epic films ever made.
1	"Stylish package has thesps hitting their marks (and each other), but also keeps the human drama from being swamped by wirework and CGI effects."
1	Its stylishly retro touch and flashy sets and stunts makes a nice package.
1	"Come for Ku's joyful choreography, stay for Yen's most memorable post-comeback performance."
1	"While ""14 Blades"" grinds on perhaps a half-hour too long, its ambitions and energies show that for a fresh take on the western, go east."
1	"Director, co-writer and production designer Daniel Lee keeps things moving so quickly, there's little time to worry about such basics as where we are or what's actually going on."
0	"Unfortunately, Archambault's churlishly over-the-top performance makes it impossible to take 14 Cameras seriously, no matter how you interpret Gerald's actions."
0	Voyeurism has never been so boring.
0	A tedious exploitation picture not even sleazy enough to find offensive.
0	"""14 Cameras"" is simply a perv fantasy pretending to be something more than the icky piece of filmmaking that it is."
1	"A remarkably compact motion picture... those who have no memory of that or any similar case will find gripping suspense, absorbing drama and stinging social comment in this film."
1	"This timely Quebecois drama can sometimes creep too far into afterschool special territory, but the intense emotions on display give it a certain raw staying power."
0	A potentially meaningful movie that hands us a double dose of despair when a ray of hope was needed.
0	"""1:54"" intends to be a straight-shooting social drama about the multifaceted problem of bullying in the digital age, but it's out of touch with how real teenagers think and act and communicate. It's a modern film that feels like a relic."
0	"The film seems exaggerated strictly to pray upon latent public fears in a calculated, predatory way."
0	Isn't as clever or as timely as it clearly perceives itself.
0	The reality of 'unscripted' programming et al. trumps the critique from the gitgo.
0	One of the most brazen pieces of blame-shifting in exploitation-picture history.
0	"Less the blistering satire it imagines itself than a blustering, bloody, blundering melodrama."
1	Boasts a fine cast and makes enough cogent points that it rises above standard cop fare.
1	"Its savage indictment of the nexus involving media, crime and a voracious public is a cinematic statement difficult to ignore."
0	[The premise is] rolled up in a formulaic young cop-old cop action flick like a sparkler in a rug.
0	"A jumping off point for showy, contrived, borderline exploitation sequences that fail to tie together because they're not really there to do anything but sell themselves as money shot thrills."
0	"Can never transcend its own crass, exploitative and cynical nature."
1	"Big, loud and lurid, but no less entertaining for that."
1	Herzfeld is smart enough to just let De Niro be De Niro.
0	Relentlessly stupid and grating.
1	It's to Herzfeld's credit that the movie's caustic observations hit the mark as often as they belabor the obvious.
0	"Watching it is like spending time with a know-it-all teenager; the kid isn't neccessarily wrong, but he's definitely irritating."
0	"Herzfeld's a secondhand-meister, simply regenerating themes, styles and a story line that we've all seen -- and tired of -- somewhere before."
0	"The movie is nothing if not ambitious. The movie is nothing if not overdone. The movie is also, well, pretty much ... nothing."
0	A clumsy urban thriller.
0	Two horrifyingly bad hours that should stand as a reminder to keep Hollywood away from big issues or anything else it can put in its mouth and choke on.
1	A shrewd thriller.
0	"The filmmaker tries to eat his cake and have it as well, giving his audience ample servings of what we presumably want while slapping our wrists for it at the same time."
1	A picture that has a crowd-stopping impact.
0	Overwrought and hypocritical.
0	"Ultra-violent, blatantly manipulative and politically reactionary."
1	"De Niro and rising star Edward Burns have just enough knowing, gritty give-and-take in 15 Minutes to make you hungry for more."
1	"A real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory."
0	"There's a dynamite movie to be made about the collision -- and collusion -- of celebrity culture, violence, and media complicity. But the hot-button 15 Minutes isn't it."
0	"A tiresome screed that purports to teach us a lesson about violence and the media even as it serves up much more than the minimum daily requirement of stabbings, bloody gunshot wounds and relentless stomach punches."
0	"Warhol's statement was just a one-liner, and a movie requires more than that to run two hours."

1	Hankin's film finally makes the indigenous variety of deadlock particular to New York politicos seem as quaintly comforting as a buttered bialy.
1	An uncommonly engrossing and articulate documentary.
1	A documentary that features forthright interviews with major players and gives a good sense of the infighting and pettiness without getting bogged down in it.
1	This interesting but undeniably bottom-line-minded chronicle of the rebuilding at Ground Zero provides a unique look at civic strife and a city's spirit.
1	This alternately amusing and heartbreaking documentary coherently chronicles the endles process of rebuilding Ground Zero.
1	A fascinating portrait of municipal and private interests trying to make headway in the charged atmosphere of devastating personal loss and wounded national pride.
0	This tale of a cop and a baker running for their lives wants to have its cake and eat it too.
1	"16 Blocks does raise the banner for the tradition of the textured urban cop drama, spurred by action but made substantial by characters at crossroads."
0	An action thriller exactly like every other.
0	"It's a small movie trying to seem epic, or a bloated monster trying to seem lean (real B movies don't have 14 producers), but it's clear that at 99 minutes, 16 Blocks should've been at least 20 minutes shorter still."
0	"Despite occasional bursts of suspense, the movie as a whole plays out as a long 95 minutes, with its lack of inventiveness leading us more frequently into tediousness than tension."
1	"The two characters have the luxury of real, reflective time to fill, something so rare in an age of zip-bang-crash-zap action-pic editing as to be classified as 'old-fashioned.'"
1	"Idiotic, for sure, but what saves 16 Blocks is Richard Donner's slick direction and the occasional flash of humor you get in most Bruce Willis flicks, whether it's in the script or not. He can scarcely say a line without smirking."
1	"Short on words and long on action, Richard Donner's adrenaline-spiked action flick is a compendium of familiar genre components."
1	"This is a sturdy little cop thriller, and even when it stretches the bounds of plausibility, you go with it, partly because you believe -- almost against your better judgment -- in what the characters are doing."
1	"The film's depiction of a defeated man summoning the moral courage to address his past is, satisfyingly, more '70s than '80s."
0	16 Blocks seems as if it has been around the block a time or two.
0	It seems such a waste to go onto the actual streets of Lower Manhattan and shoot a movie this stupid.
1	"The bedrock of the plot is the dogged determination of the Bruce Willis character. Jack may be middle-aged, he may be tired, he may be balding, he may be a drunk, but if he's played by Bruce Willis you don't want to bet against him."
1	The one bright spot in all this is Mos Def's performance.
0	"It's standard, familiar fare: Take away the profanity and swap Bruce Willis with Richard Crenna, and you would have a perfect CBS movie of the week, circa 1982."
1	[The film has] an air of believability that thankfully doesn't get lost in the sometimes fast pace of the flick.
1	This action-thriller is so predictable that you probably could outline the plot after watching a 30-second TV spot. But it's so entertaining you won't budge from your seat until the final bullet has flown.
1	"The show really belongs to Willis, who brings a hangdog authority to the midlife action pose of paunchy, hungover, yet ready to rock and roll."
0	"It goes from one implausible situation and hail of bullets to the next outlandish moment and more gunfire. There are also moments of extreme, flat dullness -- those generally being the moments when Def isn't talking."
1	"Hiding among all the uniforms and bullets, it turns out, is an actors' movie, and two actors more than capable of hitting their marks."
0	"Another urban action thriller that's better than some, worse than most and so forgettable that it's possible to forget it while watching it."
1	16 Blocks is a police procedural in the change-your-life spirit of Oprah. And I say this with the deepest respect for both genres.
0	"[Richard] Donner can direct this sort of thriller in his sleep, but he squanders the movie's sense of urgency for little acting or screen-writing indulgences."
0	"Getting anywhere in New York gridlock can take forever, especially when you're following Bruce Willis in a cookie-cutter action thriller."
1	The actors seem to have inspired the hack director Richard Donner and the cat-and-mouse game is much grittier than one would expect from the creator of the Lethal Weapon series.
1	"16 Blocks is the best of this trio [of recent crooked cop movies, including Dirty and Running Scared], thanks to the winning performances of its stars -- a restrained Bruce Willis and a very likable Mos Def."
0	"This noisy, formulaic film turns out to be immediately forgettable, except for the parts that are so ridiculous they leave you shaking your head in wonder hours later."
1	"Its dialogue is sassy, its plotting is taut (maybe too taut, as key segues are AWOL), but 16 Blocks has more on the brain than mere distraction. It aims to save souls."
1	"While 16 Blocks may be two blocks and three left-hand turns too long, it's still one sturdy cop thriller, filled with grit, corruption, action and redemption and fueled by strong performances from Bruce Willis, Mos Def and David Morse."
0	The Lethal Weapon movies were all about charismatic actors breathing life into stock characters. That doesn't happen with Willis and Def.
1	16 Blocks emerges from the seasonal shadows to provide a fair measure of entertainment.
0	It's the clamor and weak script that make it feel like a flatfoot trying to chase down a better movie.
0	In the end it's not the predictable action but the lack of chemistry and camaraderie that sinks 16 Blocks.
0	"16 Blocks feels like a remake of Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet. The Gauntlet was exciting nonsense. 16 Blocks is just dutiful, until all the duty crowds out any fun."
0	No one can dismiss 16 Blocks as a mere formula flick -- it's a mere two or three formula flicks all fighting for top billing.
0	No wonder the trip takes so long: 16 Blocks insists on taking only the most heavily travelled routes.
0	I thought this film is one long corny clich.
1	Willis and Def -- funny even if he overdoes the whiny shrieking -- are a terrific team.
1	"Willis has been playing slight variations on this role for years now, and though the films don't get better, his performances do."
1	"Clunky, solid, enjoyable."
1	"Fast-paced, tense and intermittently exciting, Donner's latest will keep genre fans engaged with its polished blend of tried and tested elements."
1	"A happier surprise is the smart work of director Richard Donner: 16 Blocks is all jumble and jangle-crowds, snarled traffic, and discordant car horns."
1	An intense and imaginatively mounted first feature.
1	A film that teeters between the rapturous and the ridiculous.
0	This Scottish memoir of inebriation and sobriety leans heavily on the hurt of booze and rarely on the high.
1	"The freely associative, poetic tone signals this isn't going to be just another grungy British pic about young malcontents and petty crime."
1	"Despite reams of maudlin narration, McKidd's powerful performance as a conflicted man makes this beautifully shot low-budget feature worth checking out."
1	"The film has a poetic pulse, its ups and downs accompanied by some smartly chosen pop songs, a seductive original score and McKidd's husky voice-over narration."
1	"It's a carefully made movie, evocatively filmed and intelligently thought out by the director and his cast."
0	Eventually the movie drowns in words.
0	"I can hardly bear to remember the songs, much less discuss them. Perhaps I shouldn't. It is just too damn bad this movie didn't take advantage of its right to the pursuit of happiness."
1	"With ""1776,"" political struggles that took place nearly two-and-a-half centuries ago feel as fresh and immediate as the political struggles of today."
1	"Impressively, the rookie scribe-helmers' sense of equilibrium is unerring and also surprisingly subtle."
1	The film captures a moment when irrationality and romantic self-delusion go viral -- and the difficulty of containing such elements.
0	"A lot of style, but not much substance."
0	Plays like the most lyrical after-school special ever; it gives lip service to the teens' anxieties and euphoria while threading in the occasional swoonworthy image.
1	"The movie takes you inside the dreamy collective mentality of bored, mildly rebellious girls who look with horror at the lives of their mostly working-class parents."
1	"The movie needs a tighter grip, yet the narrative detours, including a beach party and one especially liberating confrontation, can be surprisingly joyous."
1	"The film's rhythms mimic the volatile emotional life of adolescence: the violent rushes between euphoria and despair, the overconfident contempt for adults mixed with regressive dependence when things fall apart."
1	"""17 Girls"" doesn't try to explain its many mysteries. That would have made for a better film, but this one does a nice job showing its effects."
1	"17 Girls has a nice look, and strong performances, but ultimately, the Coulins fail to go deeply enough into the heads of their protagonists."
0	"The film suggests a state of grace between childhood and adulthood, but the narrative feels increasingly tentative, and the characters remain opaque - ""local divas,"" in one teacher's estimation."
0	"The question is why this incident seemed worth dramatizing, especially in such a dreamily romanti-cized way - with perfect pregnancies and friendly baby daddies."
0	"17 Girls is allegedly inspired by true events, but this diffident, dreamy film is so insubstantial it's hard to believe there's a speck of reality to be found in it."
0	A beautiful mess with a point of view that's way too easily distracted.
0	"Although Burns is, of course, a beloved institution, and any opportunity to see him is welcome, he is not given much to do in the movie, and he doesn't do much with it."
0	"While this Italian-language weepie blessedly sidesteps schmaltz, it disappointingly fails to capitalize on its promised premise. It's something for the re-gifting pile."
0	It's a shapeless mass of film stock containing some brilliant moments and a lot more that are singularly uninspired.
0	What high hopes were inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 -- and how few of them are realized.
0	The mannered elegance of the camerawork and lighting cocoons the whole sad mess within a veneer of utterly spurious 'style.'
0	"Great moments stud Bernardo Bertolucci's 1976 Marxist epic, but the end result is ambiguous."
0	"The revolutionaries who fought to free China from nearly 3,000 years of dynastic oppression deserve a worthier cinematic monument than 1911."
0	"If the success of epic storytelling were determined by the sheer number of unnecessary on-screen name tags, 1911 would be a masterpiece. But the small matters of characterization, audience identification, and scene-making are entirely absent here."
0	"Chan has not injected any of his playful charm or physical virtuosity into Wang Xingdong's and Chen Baoguang's insipid, poorly structured screenplay."
0	"Corny, preachy and tedious."
0	What should be rousing stuff - a republic is born! the chains of feudalism thrown off! - remains a kind of lavishly illustrated history lesson.
0	"With ""1911,'' art direction speaks louder than words."
0	1911 serves too many masters for its own good.
0	"The Revolution will not be televised, Gil Scott-Heron once sang. Nor should it be filmed, we might add -- at least not as a costume drama with stirring speeches, an inspirational love story and gloriously heroic military charges."
0	Earnest and studious to a fault. Rarely has a film about upheaval felt more like a textbook.
0	May be slow going for anyone not well-versed in this chapter of Chinese history.
0	Packed with so many characters and subtitled history lessons it barely allows its excellent main cast room to maneuver.
0	"Let there be no doubt that everyone involved with 1917 gave their all to the exercise. But its ultimate status as an exercise is, likewise, without doubt."
1	"It may be a grandiose flourish, but you can't deny it makes for a startlingly literal theater of war."
1	The movie is more successful as a thriller than as a thoughtful examination of war and its horrors; Mendes seems less interested in the nightmare of battle and its effects on his characters than he is in Hitchcockian audience manipulation.
1	"[L]egendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men, Fargo, Blade Runner 2049) effectively drops the viewer in the center of the story and compels them to stay there, fully immersed in every muddy step, hunger pang, and rifle click."
1	"There's no time to pause, even for great beauty, a lesson that even ""1917"" is often loathe to honor."
1	"Sam Mendes's 1917 is an amazingly audacious film; as exciting as a heist movie, disturbing as a sci-fi nightmare."
1	"[T]his is a protean display of virtuoso filmmaking, one that film aesthetes will wallow in but that even ordinary audiences will note and appreciate."
1	"Astonishing as his filmmaking can be at times, it's Mendes' attention to character, more than the technique, that makes ""1917"" one of 2019's most impressive cinematic achievements."
1	"""1917"" is a modern war classic and one of the best movies of the year."
1	"'Once Upon a Time on the Western Front', as you could subtitle Sam Mendes's nerve-fraying rollercoaster of a war movie, is a simple men-on-a-mission dressed up with all the technical bells and whistles at the director's disposal."
0	"[I]t's hard to totally invest in the plight of these frazzled grunts when they're both filmed and characterized like video-game avatars, guided from one ""level"" to the next."
1	"Sam Mendes delivers the film of his career by mashing up the survivalist thrills of The Revenant with the helter-skelter mayhem of a shoot'em'up video game, and setting it during the Great War."
1	"The film proves once again that war is hell, but the aftermath can be just as visceral and thoughtful."
1	"A highly convincing welter of dirt, exhaustion, and decay..."
1	Its pace is as propulsive as the film's conceit is ambitious. It all leads up to a climactic battlefield dash that should justifiably become a staple of war-cinema highlight reels for decades to come.
1	"What might have been easily dismissed as little more than a simplistic stunt, instead becomes a potent and unforgettable piece of cinema."
1	"Every war is hell, no matter when it was fought, but 1917, which is about a war far removed from contemporary reality, turns out to the best war picture since Saving Private Ryan."
1	"One needn't be British to feel the epic loss and grief of 1917, thanks to some very committed performances, the intimacy achieved by the movie's style and camera and Mr. Mendes's obvious devotion to what he's doing."
1	An immersive war film driven by bravura camerawork and spectacular effects.
1	"By the time it ends, Mendes has built within the audience an intense desire to see the men's message successfully delivered, and like a true dramatist, Mendes milks it for every drop of tension. He does not blow his big finish."
1	The film has a lot of propulsive energy that I found pretty delightful.
1	One of the best movies of 2019.
1	"In one of the best war films of all time, director Sam Mendes brilliantly delivers a story of two WWI soldiers on a mission that's a stunning technical accomplishment that unfurls as one single take - and a deeply felt tale of heroism under fire."
1	"Gripping, heart-stopping, blood- and mud-soaked, immersive and unforgettable..."
1	"A stunning feat of cinematography, production design and performance moving seamlessly as one piece."
0	The artifice of the aesthetic premise overwhelms any of the film's other intentions.
1	"It musters extraordinary technical daring in the service of a homily that boils down yet again to simply, ""War is Hell."""
0	"Despite the film's salient features, ""1917"" feels oddly underwhelming. It might succeed in making viewers as exhausted as the characters, but it lacks the emotional punch this story requires to make it a lasting impact."
0	"Sitting through it is like watching someone else playing a video game for two solid hours, and not an especially compelling one at that."
1	The movie never breaks its rules and never loses sight of its objective.
1	"The filmmakers don't shy from set pieces that would be astonishing even without their central gimmick. They set themselves a challenge for ""1917"", and met it in ways sure to be talked about by lovers of cinema for quite a while."
0	A carefully organized and sanitized war picture... that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship.
1	"Sam Mendes, has similarly taken top technology - and the best cinematography - to give us a different, equally compelling look at that cruel war, through the eyes of two ordinary soldiers asked to perform an extraordinary task."
1	"Mendes has made a film that feels wholly alive. It's a carefully polished picture, not one that strives for gritty realism. But its inherent devotion to life and beauty is part of its power..."
1	This is a tremendous technical achievement and I was just dazzled the whole time.
1	"Director Sam Mendes [personalizes] the experience through two young British soldiers sent on a harrowing, high-stakes, night-long mission, he creates a film that is tense, exhilarating and profoundly moving."
1	"Yet the tale unfolds with considerable sensitivity, offering plenty of haunting images while capturing the chaos and fear of trench warfare -- especially through the eyes of MacKay, in a genuine breakout performance."
1	"The overall impact of 1917 is simply breathtaking, horrifying, appalling. It offers a compelling version of what a day in the war might have felt like for two soldiers."
1	"Union general William Tecumseh Sherman once said, ""War is hell."" Sam Mendes with ""1917"" says, ""Hold my beer."""
1	"MacKay and Chapman disappear into their roles, pulling us into the story."
1	A huge technical achievement. An immersive war film that's low on plot but high on blistering action.
1	"If Mendes' film-making has sometimes felt to have not fully outgrown his beginnings in theatre, 1917 is wildly cinematic, a movie that makes you feel the breath of mortality on your neck."
1	"War is much on the minds of people right now, and ""1917"" is a good reminder, flaws and all, of what that really entails."
0	"While Mendes didn't shrink from displaying the vivid imagination of a suburban horndog, he's unwilling to face the imagination of the valorous combatants of ""1917."""
1	"1917's ambitious gambit soon becomes a double-edged sword: it brings us closer to these men, but sets them apart from the collective experiences it seeks to memorialise."
1	"From the sole perspective of the filmmaking craft, ""1917"" is worth a watch."
1	"The film is thrilling, moving on effectively from one shocking set piece to another, studding the narrative too with starry cameos."
1	"It's a tense, unnerving ride that accomplishes its goal of translating the first-person experience of war better than any war movies that have come before it. It's a level up."
1	"Too often actors playing rural roles mistake ""slow"" for ""stupid,"" but Jane pinpoints Wilfred's mental acuity without rushing through reactions that feel anachronistic or phony."
1	A largely satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's novella about unappeasable guilt triggered by the mortal sin of murder.
1	"It doesn't take any shocking new twists, but musters just enough fresh polish to a classic scenario to make it worth one more ride."
1	"The film is not lurid in its scares, and instead depicts its protagonist's suffering mostly as a slow rot."
1	"There's an unshakable menace that lingers, a tale of guilt and regret that burrows its way under the skin."
1	"[1922] is a credible addition to a filmography where practically every thought the writer commits to paper is, seemingly, deemed fit for the screen."
0	The familiar case of a short story stretched too thin in a feature film.
1	"In cinemas, it might have been overshadowed by flashier rivals, but perhaps, on demand, this slow, but winningly bleak little tale will find the audience it deserves."
0	It may possibly be that Mr. Spielberg has chosen gigantic size and unlimited quantity as his comedy method in the awareness that he has no gift whatsoever for small-scale comic conceits.
0	The film feels coolly detached because the story and characters are underdeveloped.
1	"Suitably low-key but sometimes under-realized, this drama is fueled by its working-class milieu and a heart-wrenching performance by Hill Harper."
1	"Michael Radford's brilliant film of Orwell's vision does a good job of finding that line between the ""future"" world of 1984 and the grim postwar world in which Orwell wrote."
0	"Nodding to the movie's bleak mood, Burton bleakens himself; robbed of the pleasures of the grand, show-offy way he could use his voice, the mischievous twinkle of his eye, you feel cheated."
1	"Anchored by a deeply felt central performance from Cory Michael Smith, the modest but affecting film should find a receptive niche with LGBT audiences."
1	It is a haunting elegy for a generation of gay men.
1	"This is a realistic, discreet, yet exploratory film that earns its tears honestly and scrupulously."
1	"All the performances are very good (though one might ask why no one has a regional accent), with stage-trained Smith providing a center of quiet intensity."
1	"This profoundly resonant, smartly understated black-and-white film greatly benefits from more than 30 years worth of sociosexual perspective that reminds us how much has changed, yet how much else has not."
1	A moving cinematic sketch of a HIV-infected man living through the height of the plague.
1	1985 feels like a missing minor classic from the decade that preceded the rise of the so-called New Queer Cinema.
1	"It's a beautifully acted film. In the dark days of the epidemic it would surely have been impossible to make a drama so balanced, so compassionately attuned to everyone's feelings."
1	"Writer-director Yen Tan, expanding a same-subject short film, takes his tale slowly, letting the drama breathe and the cast essay ""being"" rather than ""acting""."
1	"The dark inky frames are full of shadows and dread. Yet the narrative, and Adrian's journey, is always leavened with quiet compassion."
1	A poignant footnote to a monumental crisis.
1	"What really distinguishes the film is that it gets deep inside this broken family without becoming histrionic or accusatory. Tan avoids any hint of sentimentality, concentrating on the pain instead."
1	"Director Dennis Iliadis doesn't overdwell on the existentialism of the concept; he lets emotional beats strobe against the WTF experience of the temporal doubles, peppering the action with distinct images and events to make the repetition stand out."
1	A fleet and frenzied sci-fi tale with more on its mind than alien gate-crashers.
0	"In trying to say everything, ""Plus One"" reveals it doesn't have much to say at all."
0	"The writing/directing debut of Minhal Baig enlists experienced actors but has little idea what to do with them, making a hash of its intended meditation on the compromises required by long-term relationships."
0	"This romantic fantasy works on a conceptual level, but not in execution."
1	"The journey could be a bit more eventful, but the payoff is charming."
0	"Even its wistful tone points toward an opportunity missed; unfortunately, the film doesn't fully explore its big ideas or give its talented cast dialogue to match."
1	A solid woman-in-peril thriller well suited to contemporary paranoiacs.
1	"The premise remains intriguing enough to make ""1BR"" a qualified success, albeit one whose ideas sometimes cry for a more adventuresome and assertive treatment."
1	"All of this boldness pays off-the film's third act might end at an expected place, but 1BR stands out with how it gets there, and the unique horror along the way."
1	"Real-life details culled from ex-members' accounts of life in groups like Scientology and NXIVM give the film an edgy ripped-from-the-headlines quality, as well as reinforcing the sheer L.A. of it all."
1	"There's a light at the end of the tunnel for Sarah, and seeing her claw her way to it is often fun, albeit in a gasp-inducing sort of way."
1	"Drawing on a fascination with cults and utopian communities, the director and co-writer, David Marmor, has created a mildly entertaining survival story whose depiction of psychological indoctrination far outstrips its generic dips into torture."
1	1BR's unique timeline paired with its palpable tension makes for a memorable addition to the horror-movies-about-cults catalog.
1	This innovative study of Nick Cave playfully disguises itself as fiction while more than fulfilling the requirements of a biographical documentary.
1	"There's nothing extraordinary about it, but it's an entertaining curio."
1	"20,000 Days On Earth is elegant and elusive, artfully arranged and visualised by Forsyth and Pollard."
1	"This won't be for everyone, but longtime Cave-men (and women) will be bewitched, along with a fair share of folks drawn in simply by the film's unique investigation into the mind of an artist."
1	The pervasive mood is a brooding hyperawareness of time and the brevity of existence. Sensationalism and salaciousness are minimal.
1	"This is a doc with, among other things, a firm sense of place, and not just your random filmed Q&A with an interesting guy."
1	"We spend one day on Earth with Nick Cave, from dawn til dusk, via family, friends, a recording session and a gig, but it's just a neat device, and much of the film plays out like drama."
1	"Cave knows he's not young anymore, and won't always be able to control his work or how its perceived. Watching him act accordingly is really inspiring."
1	"The results are remarkably intelligent and entertaining, even for someone who (like this writer) finds Cave's music rather dirge-like."
1	"No ordinary rock doc, but nothing particularly special either."
1	It's more than just a screen biography: it's a meditation on an artist's mythology and creative spirit.
1	"20,000 Days On Earth doesn't try to be a journalistic, comprehensive study of its subject -- but with so much texture and atmosphere on tap, it doesn't need to."
1	"I'm not sure it can be considered a documentary at all, at least not all the way through. But ""20,000 Days"" offers an exceptionally intimate portrait of an artist who has sometimes sought to resist explication."
1	Forsyth and Pollard's approach is reverential rather than critical but the film is beautifully shot and its impressionistic approach is a welcome antidote to that of most rock docs.
1	"Certainly for any fan of Cave's, 20,000 Days on Earth makes for a creative, enthralling journey through the man's world."
1	"If Mick Jagger attempted something like this, it would be excruciating."
1	"For me, the talking is great, perhaps more than the music, and there is something a tiny bit narcissistic about the lengthy clips of those live shows."
1	"[Nina Simone] put a spell on him, and now Nick Cave, with his lugubrious sleights of hand, does much the same to us."
1	"Whether or not you love his music, the sheer intelligence and poetry of his lyrics, his hip-swivelling suits, his retro black Jag and achingly cool hair make 20,000 Days on Earth a documentary worth watching."
1	"It's right up there with the best rock documentaries. That is, if you can call it a documentary."
1	"Maybe ""20,000 Days on Earth"" is a vanity film. But maybe Cave has earned the right to be vain."
0	The film is so incessant on bolstering Cave's repute and noble struggle with the art of songwriting that it can't help but seem bloated and self-important.
1	"It's a wondrous mix of the momentous and mundane, the profound and the perverse, with Cave blues-talking his way through the goofy juxtapositions, the darkness, and the light."
1	"For the uninitiated, it offers a demonstration of what is so mesmerizing about this performer, who is by, his own description, ""a kind of ostentatious bastard."""
1	"You might come away wishing he'd remained a bit more enigmatic. Then again, that morose rascal is probably just having us on."
1	"Singular exercise in self-indulgence, introspection and tongue-in-cheekiness by the solemn and magnetic Cave."
1	"You don't just meet and learn about Nick Cave in ""20,000 Days,"" you feel him."
1	"""Something happens onstage,"" Cave says, ""where you forget who you are and become someone else."" As much as any documentary can, 20,000 Days on Earth allows us to bear witness to what goes on in that process."
0	"The title refers to the fact that the day chronicled is ostensibly Cave's 20,000th alive, though the movie is so slowly paced that 20,000 days seems more like the running time."
1	"Near the end of the movie, Cave talks about living in the 'shimmering space' where imagination and reality intersect. He's talking about words and music, but he could be talking about 20,000 Days on Earth."
0	Forsyth and Pollard are visual artists-turned-filmmakers and their fine feel for the romantic possibilities of lighting and composition shape every frame. They're less sensitive to the line that separates drama from pretentiousness.
1	An intelligent and revealing look at one of rock's last true iconoclasts.
1	"A cold, majestic motion picture, a movie that seeks to remind us of the vastness of space and our relatively insignificant place in it."
1	"The film creates its effects essentially out of visuals and music. It is meditative. It does not cater to us, but wants to inspire us, enlarge us."
1	I assumed that this was what all movies ought to be: treasures for moral and aesthetic contemplation that did not provide all their answers on first contact.
0	"The movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems, its use of color and space, its fanatical devotion to science-fiction detail, that its is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."
1	Its triumph lies in its scope of cinematic splendour and the attempt to marry some of man's most beautiful music to the infinite mystery of space.
0	"2001 compares with, but does not best, previous efforts at science fiction."
0	"Now, seen in the actual 2001, it's less a visionary masterpiece than a crackpot Looney Tune, pretentious, abysmally slow, amateurishly acted and, above all, wrong."
1	You can watch 2001 as a visual journey with nary a thought for what's under the surface or you can plunge into this vortex of interpretations. The great thing about 2001 is that either approach works fine. That's why it endures.
1	"Yup, you guessed it -- a religious experience."
0	High marks for Kubrick the special-effects man; but where was Kubrick the director?
1	"It is an extraordinary, obsessive, beautiful work of art."
1	"For all the essential coldness of Kubrick's vision, it demands attention as superior sci-fi, simply because it's more concerned with ideas than with Boy's Own-style pyrotechnics."
1	"The film's projections of the cold war and antiquated product placements may look quaint now, but the poetry is as hard-edged and full of wonder as ever."
1	"It was a freshening attitude then, though its long-term effects haven't been all to the good."
1	"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is some sort of great film, and an unforgettable endeavor. Technically and imaginatively, what he put into it is staggering."
1	"2001 lingers on the mind like a tall, black riddle: Where are the new bones, the new tools, that will take us higher? Do we even deserve them?"
1	"Though it fails as drama, Stanley Kubrick's venture succeeds as dazzling visual art."
1	"[2001] might be best described as a factual philosophical speculation, rather than as the drama it sets out as but never develops into: and like all good speculations, it leaves the spectator up in the air with a tantalising vision as food for thought."
1	2001 will emerge from its initial long-run Cinerama engagements and subsequent extended runs as one of MGM's all-time box office hits ...
1	Kubrick leaves usual considerations behind with his readiness to imagine a post-human future.
1	Top marks for craftsmanship is an understatement.
1	"Kubrick's spaceships are perhaps little more than Airfix models, but he makes them majestic, even awesome in the proper sense of the word."
1	"I shall go and see it again as soon as possible, for one thing is clear. Man has shrunk space, but Kubrick has expanded the cinema."
0	"A small sphere of intellectuals will feel that Kubrick has said something, simply because one expected him to say something. ... Most moviegoers will only wish that Mr. Kubrick would come back down to earth."
0	"Aa whimsical space operetta, then frantically inflates itself again for a surreal climax in which the imagery is just obscure enough to be annoying, just precise enough to be banal."
0	"Speculation and ambiguity are fine, but it does rather look as if Kubrick and his co-writer, Arthur C. Clarke, just haven't thought it through."
1	"The film is a journey through outer space, but it is also a journey through cinematic space. It conjures the future by making you sit through its vision of the future, spending time just being in it."
1	Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the picture which science-fiction enthusiasts of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed (sometimes forlornly) that the industry might one day give them.
1	"Now that enough time has elapsed since the release of 2010 for outraged 2001 fans to calm down, it can be seen that, while there was no decisive creative reason for Hyams' sequel to exist, it's not a bad movie."
1	The build-up to this and the initial moments on board are racked with a tension that's superbly handled by Hyams. He maintains the forbidding atmosphere well and his skills as a cinematographer are evident.
0	"A lot of care has gone into it, but it has no satirical substructure to match that of the Kubrick film, and which was eventually responsible for that film's continuing popularity."
1	"A good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera."
1	"Hyams' sequel to Kubrick's big daddy of sci-fi movies may not have the novelty of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it is still a better film than anyone could have dared to expect."
0	A hodge-podge of bits and pieces.
0	"Flash: There is intelligent life in outer space. More, anyway, than in this amiable footnote of a movie."
0	"Andy Lau and Gong Li are appealing leads, but this Chinese-language carbon copy doesn't find a distinctive voice."
0	"This waaay overlong, Mandarin-language remake seems more the result of the kind of marketing-mentality it professes to mock."
0	"Asian superstars Gong Li and Andy Lau spark together, but the script rarely produces fireworks."
0	"The two-hour-and-40-minute 2012 is overstuffed with special-effects, but the Curtis clan's mad dash out of town is the closest the movie gets to actually being fun."
0	"Eye-popping special effects ensure that this movie will be a smash hit, and while it's entertaining for most of its excessive running time, the cheesy script fails to live up to the grandeur of the physical production."
0	"On any level other than as sheer visual sensation, 2012 is a joke, for the simple reason that it has no point of view."
1	Guilty pleasures don't come guiltier than 2012.
0	"For too much of the 2 1/2-hour 2012, the end is not near."
0	"Are we meant to applaud when skyscrapers topple and ships capsize, with tiny digital faceless bodies plummeting into the void? You make the disaster this real and it's not entertaining or chilling."
1	"It's easy to mock throwaway blockbusters like 2012, but as enthralling, mindless entertainment, the film is difficult to fault."
0	"Beware 2012, which works the dubious miracle of almost matching Transformers 2 for sheer, cynical, mind-numbing, time-wasting, money-draining, soul-sucking stupidity."
0	"The effects are expensive-looking and impressive enough while you're watching them, although whatever awe they inspire doesn't last long: When you've seen one Washington Monument fall to bits, you've seen them all."
1	"People talk about ""formula"" almost always as a pejorative, but formulas get to be formulas because they work, and there's something to be said for a formula picture done almost to perfection."
0	"Hollywood's most successful one-trick pony, Emmerich claims to favor ""human stories"" over end-of-the-world spectacle, but watching 2012 is like watching a sausage machine explode."
0	I found myself reaching for a phantom video-game controller to help Our Heroes and Heroine defy certain death.
0	Actors say silly lines with deadly seriousness. Exposition is wielded like a sledgehammer. All you can do is grit your teeth and wait for the next wave of destruction.
0	"A state-of-the-art multiplex three-ring circus whose special effects stagger the senses and play like a video game, whose human drama aims for the cosmic and lands waist-deep in the Big Silly."
0	"Any sentient viewer will be able to predict every lumpy twist of this ludicrous, fitfully enjoyable movie."
1	"(Many) will decry ""2012"" as a plotless, illogical, clichd, demented popcorn flick (because it is), but this is that rare case where the apocalypse, at least in terms of big-budget blown-up spectacle movie-making, is hardly the end of the world."
1	"Sets a goal and slamdunks it, squeezing in so much fun that by the credits, I'd forgotten about Woody Harrelson's turn as a pickle-chomping AM radio meteorological messiah."
0	"Independence Day began a game of landmark-destroying one-upmanship. Here, Emmerich takes the competition global, but the soundtrack's organ-rattling low-end makes a deeper impact than the film's visuals."
0	Perhaps writer-director Roland Emmerich was hoping for a so-bad-it's-good cult status with his latest disaster flick.
0	"If, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made."
1	"I quite enjoyed the experience, at least the first five or six hours of it. 2012 is not simply the last disaster movie you ever need to see. It's the last movie you ever need to see."
0	There are times when 2012 feels as if it is not going to end until 2012...
1	"This is fun. 2012 delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting anything else, it will be, for its audiences, one of the most satisfactory films of the year."
0	"It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel...like I have a headache."
0	"[Nothing] will give you more respect for how difficult it is to be an actor than watching top talent like John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet and Oliver Platt struggling to treat the film's ungodly language and situations with perfect seriousness."
0	"As always in Emmerich's rollicking Armageddons, the cannon speaks with an expensive bang, while the fodder gets afforded nary a whimper."
0	"This is fear-mongering, sentimental, horror show shtick, but it's also fairly competent, making 2012 a work of awful efficiency"
0	"[J]ust as the cyclones and tsunamis of The Day After Tomorrow ultimately succumbed to a bad case of narrative frostbite, 2012's ludicrous thrills begin burning themselves out by the movie's midpoint."
0	"If the viewer were ever invited to think or feel about what's happening on-screen, the movie's wow-whoa-ain't-it-cool momentum would collapse in a heap of horrific preposterousness."
0	"As you might expect with director Roland Emmerich, the movie isn't a patch on the trailer."
0	"Despite the frenetic action scenes, the movie sags, done in by multiple story lines that undercut one another and by the heaviness of its conceit."
1	"Bigger, louder, crazier and more wildly exhilarating than anything previously attempted."
0	"2012, a near three-hour movie built entirely out of special effects set pieces and join-the-dots characterisation."
1	"The crowning achievement in Emmerich's long, profitable career as a destroyer of worlds."
0	"Emmerich's vision of global huddling and new-dawn optimism has a harebrained naivety you almost want to treasure, but that's this idiot behemoth of a film all over: dim, dim, dim, and so absurdly overscaled that we're not supposed to mind."
0	"2012 is terrible, lazy, Hollywood trash. It is completely unoriginal with no structure, a script akin to having a drill put through your eardrum and a talented ensemble cast who are so obviously going through the motions."
1	Only a movie critic without a sense of humor would question whether you could really drive a limo straight through a collapsing skyscraper...or whether the Dalai Lama really owns a pickup truck.
1	Preposterous? You bet. But 2012 delivers the disaster-movie goods better than any other popcorn movie we've seen since the '80s.
0	This oafish epic about the End of Days -- as predicted by the Mayan calendar -- operates in a dead zone roughly equidistant between parody and idiocy.
0	I could fairly describe the 2012 plot as follows: The highest-paid members of an indifferent cast survive the massive floods and giant fireballs that cause our planet's destruction.
0	"The movie is an undeniable visual spectacle, but just as unequivocally a cheesy, ridiculous story."
1	"Roland Emmerich is an apocalypse chef. In 2012 he cooks America till it boils, adding live meat to the process at judicious intervals."
0	"In between the explosions and quakes you sometimes hear snatches of the script, and then wish you hadn't."
1	"2012 may be the biggest disaster movie ever made, an awesome and ridiculous film that leaves you thrilled beyond the point of your natural endurance."
1	"Even though this movie's running time of two and a half hours is about one hour too long, there's still some pretty cool disaster stuff on the way."
0	"2012 is so long, and its special effects are at once so outrageous and so thunderously predictable, that by the time I lurched from the theatre I felt that three years had actually passed and that the apocalypse was due any second."
1	2012 is reminiscent of yesteryear '80s shlock-tastic blockbusters -- total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous dialogue and impossible situations and special effects that will boggle the brain for a good two-+ hours.
1	2012 is the rare case of a bad film that I'm nevertheless obliged to recommend you see.
1	"Cusack, with his one-of-the-guys face and his nice way with child actors, does creditable work as an Average American Dad trying to put things right."

1	"While it's highly unlikely that anyone predisposed to championing Obama would be won over by the sound and fury here, there's no gainsaying the value of 2016 as a sort of Cliffs Notes precis of the conservative case against [Obama]."
0	"Not interviewed by the filmmakers are Obama's political supporters, but this isn't that kind of documentary."
1	An exercise in preaching to the choir.
0	"The film asks the question ""If Obama wins a second term, where will we be in 2016?,"" then posits some disturbing answers. Disturbing, but dubious."
0	"The film is not after new insight; rather, it's intent on laying out the arguments of a man who has given the same lecture countless times. That makes for a sluggish film. Even its outrage falls flat."
0	"Presented as a conspiracy-thriller with ominous music and zig-zaggy camerawork, ""2016"" hammers at suspicions, not issues -- a dishonorable tactic whether from the right or the left."
0	A nonsensically unsubstantiated act of character assassination.
0	D'Souza's demented anti-Obama crusade feels personal more than political.
0	"The film is a sleepy dud, a polemic that, like D'Souza himself, is at once both outrageous and deeply boring."
0	"The movie seems destined to irritate the president's supporters while mobilizing his detractors, even as it is doomed to win precious few converts. It's a textbook example of preaching to the choir."
0	"No one doubts that the country faces major challenges in the next four years, but there is one safe bet: The future is unlikely to be affected by this simplistic documentary."
0	Viewers may do some headscratching. This can be a very strange movie.
0	"Every anti-Obama argument D'Souza makes from the right could be made, more forcefully, from the left."
0	"""2050"" has a meaningful subject, but is so dialogue-heavy and incident-light that almost the entire film feels like a pitch for the movie Holt didn't make."
0	20 Centimeters is a flaccid bore.
0	"Director (Ramon) Salazar is no Pedro Almodvar, try as he might."
0	"Size plays a major role in this brash, vivacious concoction of dark comedy, light drama and musical performance."
1	"Director Ramn Salazar, in only his second feature, distinguishes himself from others who so less effectively bend genres, and genders."
0	"Here's yet another self-consciously 'Almodvarian' confection, studded with small odes to the glory of self-creation."
1	"Showing a stylistic bravura and confidence rare among upcoming Spanish helmers, Ramon Salazar's campy 20 Centimeters is a self-regarding but vastly entertaining sophomore effort."
0	"There's not much to savor in the way of plot, and the film aimlessly wanders through Marietta's life."
1	Twenty Feet From Stardom wages a compelling crusade to get background singers some long-overdue recognition.
1	"Between the welcome anecdotes, the wealth of archival footage, the well-polished production values and an inevitably remarkable soundtrack spanning the greatest decades of American rock and soul, Stardom mostly hits the right notes."
1	You gasp at the ecstatic convergence of lung power and spirit.
1	"An exquisitely rendered look at the dialectics of celebrity and artistry, luck and hard work, its conversation laced with smart observations about race and gender."
1	[Neville] nails the sense of joie de vivre these extraordinary artists put into every note-a tribute to doing it for the love of the expression over stardom that provides incalculable amounts of inspiration.
1	"Their voices are powerful enough to tear you apart and put you back together again, and their stories will do the same."
1	"This generous, fascinating documentary about the careers of backup singers, most of them African-American women, seeks to rewrite the history of pop music by focusing attention on voices at once marginal and vital."
1	"They perform with world-famous musical acts, but theirs are not household names. Their stories, however, are inspiring, heartbreaking and enthralling."
1	"Why should you see a documentary about backup singers? One look at the electrifying 20 Feet From Stardom and you'll have the answer, that is, after you stop cheering."
1	"More than a tribute, the film is a recognition of the talent and sacrifice that many of these vocalists have invested in often challenging careers."
1	Neville doesn't dwell unduly on the vicissitudes of fame; he's more concerned with celebrating his subjects' accomplishments and giving them a(nother) chance through new recordings on which they sing both backup and lead.
1	I have rarely seen a movie that better expressed the revivifying nature of music.
1	"In a film that's often sad but not without its triumphs, director Morgan Neville smartly explores the complex role that ego and self-promotion play in this profession."
1	"When any one of these women steps up to the microphone - well, they really soar. And they carry us along with them."
1	"20 Feet from Stardom has it all -- electric, revelatory stories, engaging personalities, and a gusto that takes you higher and higher."
1	"An engaging look at the nexus of art and commerce, talent and hard work. It's a story of standing out and blending in, sometimes at the same time."
1	A film that may be the happiest time you'll have at the movies all summer.
1	"This film festival favorite is a genuine crowd pleaser, meant to right a few wrongs in the music industry, offer a window into the lives of some hard-charging entertainers, and above all make audiences leave the theater humming a song."
1	"This illuminating documentary looks into a small corner of the music industry to find deeper truths about talent, artistry and success."
1	"Loaded with stirring anecdotes and even richer music, Twenty Feet also makes for a fascinating study in ego sublimation."
1	"This spirited, thoughtful look at unheralded but ubiquitous artists gives supreme credit where credit is due."
1	"For once, the spotlight shines on these brilliant women who spent most of their careers on the outskirts of fame with minimal fortune to show for their efforts."
1	"Music documentarian Morgan Neville uses a mix of live interviews and archival footage to let the singers, and their music, tell their stories of vocal triumph and thwarted ambition."
1	"You know all those doo-doo-doos and whoa-whoas-whoas you hear in pop hits? Without them, supplied by the likes of Darlene Love and Merry Clayton, you likely wouldn't be singing along to the songs you hear on your car radio."
1	You may never hear the Rolling Stones's Gimme Shelter the same way again after hearing Jagger's and Clayton's separate accounts of the recording of the song.
1	"The enthusiasm and love of music on display is just unavoidable. ""20 Feet"" may not get the whole story, but it gets some good ones."
1	"The movie takes its cues from Standing in the Shadows of Motown, another act of pop-culture revisionism that tried to give musical credit where it was due."
1	Just about everything in this movie is right. And anybody who gives a rip about unsung heroines of popular music and giving credit when credit's overdue had better come up with a good excuse not to see it.
1	"As long as you're hearing the singing and stories of Lisa Fischer, Merry Clayton, and the great Darlene Love, you can bliss out on their passion."
1	"It's that versatility that defines these singers, the ability to make following seem as important as leading."
1	"The documentary tells similarly poignant stories in a fast-paced 91 minutes through interviews, contemporary concert footage and great archival stuff."
1	"Such a great idea for a documentary, and such a surprise to realise that it has never been done before."
1	"This is a musical field of dreams high in corn, but also, sometimes, in the epiphanic empowerment and wonder of stardom conferred."
1	A warm and fitting tribute to talented singers.
1	"20 Feet from Stardom, this year's Oscar-winner for Best Documentary, is both rousing, upbeat fare... and a film steeped in a strange sense of yearning and regret."
1	An enjoyable arts feature with its heart in the right place ...
1	"Artists including Mick Jagger talk about their backing singers -- and the soundtrack is, of course, heavenly."
0	"Attractive and capably acted but oddly airless, the drama is a downer without offering much reward for our time."
1	Compelling if difficult viewing for anyone interested in seeing a variety of parental experiences on screen.
1	"The movie suffers from its fussy narrative structure, with serial flashbacks and one perplexing flash-forward, but Anna Margaret Hollyman drives the story with a smart, layered performance as the expectant mother."
0	"""20th Century Women"" is an endless chain of anecdotes, and though many individual moments are winning, the movie as a whole is rudderless. It never achieves an emotional power surge."
1	"The sheer likability of these lived-in characters is a powerful magnet, thanks to insightful writing and a note-perfect ensemble anchored by a never-better Annette Bening ..."
1	"The result is much more complex and exploratory than Beginners which, for all its charm, felt a little thin."
1	"Less twee and more textured than Beginners, this is the film that Mike Mills was put on this planet to make."
1	"When 20th Century Women concerns itself with the utterly human question of personal satisfaction, it's huggable: the kind of movie you wish more directors had the courage to grab for."
1	"The movie belongs wholeheartedly to Bening, and to the age, come and gone, that she enshrines."
1	"Mills - who last gave the semi-autobiographical treatment to his dad in ""Beginners"" - draws on strong memories and a rich imagination to recreate Santa Barbara circa 1979 and its denizens."
1	"20th Century Women is irreducible ... although certain adjectives and adverbs do leap to mind: generous, reflective, absolutely delightful."
1	"20th Century Women proves that Mike Mills is the real deal, that his previous success story was not a fluke but the announcement of an exciting new voice."
1	"Plotwise, Women is a wisp; as a mood piece, though, it's almost irresistibly rich."
1	"Detail-packed but never dull, with dialogue that absolutely sings and characters we want to stay with forever, it's the kind of work that begs revisiting, like a favorite collection of short stories."
1	"[Mills is] good with actors, and with Bening especially, he's really keyed into her prodigious gifts."
1	The most pleasurable aspect of 20th Century Women (and it's pleasurable throughout) is that it allows itself to be messy.
1	"A bracing, invigorating gulp of cinematic oxygen."
1	"Love and loss go hand in hand in ""20th Century Women,"" a funny, emotionally piercing story about a teenager and the women who raise him."
1	"Despite being set in the late 1970s, ""20th Century Women"" feels like the perfect movie for this moment."
1	A simply glorious Annette Bening (the Academy needs to that Best Actress nomination happen) leads a stellar cast in Mike Mills' semiautobiographical story about a bohemian women raising a teen in the age of 1970's feminism and punk rock.
0	"Despite the movie's title and Bening's central role, women are oddly peripheral."
1	20th Century Women is something special.
1	"A thoughtful and detailed evocation of an era and especially of one complicated character, with little story to speak of."
1	"If 20th Century Women is as wistful and pleasant as an ocean breeze, its message also dissipates about as quickly as the sand between your toes."
1	"""20th Century Women"" doesn't get unduly hung up on plot, or even with the usual forward motion of a coming-of-age narrative. It's a group portrait of a makeshift family."
1	A fiercely inquisitive performance from Annette Bening buoys this otherwise pedestrian indie drama by writer-director Mike Mills.
1	"There's not a single false, ""actor-y"" note in Bening's work. It is a master class in nuanced acting, and it is deserving of an Academy Award."
1	Bening's characters are always as comfortable as Dorothea's abode; we never see or feel the exertion behind the acting.
1	"20th Century Women will likely mean more to anyone old enough to have experienced the '70s, but the movie's big draw is Bening."
1	"As a celebration of personal and social history, ""20th Century Women"" takes the audience back. But it also lifts us up on a wave of openhearted emotion and keen intelligence. It bursts with the sad, messy, ungovernable beauty of life."
1	"Every time the story is on a knife edge and can drop deeper into turmoil or recede back to the normal flows and ebbs of life, Mills chooses the latter. But this time, the strategy works. It feels real."
1	"If you're looking for the big plot twist, the dramatic breakdown, the heroic action or some other revelation, you won't find it here. Instead we see a woman working through her life, albeit in unconventional ways."
1	"It breathes with the open-ended friendliness of a '70s film - vintage Jonathan Demme, perhaps."
1	"The most surprising part of the movie is how well Mills writes his three women, and how accurately he pinpoints their very distinct anxieties."
1	"If the small domestic drama established in this rich period setting proves satisfyingly emotional, it is because the characters are acutely well observed, both by Mills's script and by his excellent cast."
1	"The drama of Mike Mills' ""20th Century Women"" takes place in Annette Bening's masterful pauses."
1	"""20th Century Women"" takes a while to kick in but eventually finds its groove."
1	"The film is well worth a look, if just for the performances; just know going in that director Mills calls upon his cast and script to do most of the heavy lifting."
1	It's a credit to Mills that he makes it feel like he's making the Earth move even when he's just capturing a snapshot in time.
0	"Mills's world is certainly not devoid of pain, but it's leached of bitterness, leached of conflict, leached of aggression, leached of hostility; the pain and the trauma are leached of consequence."
1	"Mills' perspective on formative relationships is absorbing, and he seems like a great guy."
1	You won't see any other film this year that tries as hard to get under the skin of its characters as Mike Mills' 20th Century Women. That's both its glory and what makes it sometimes such a trial.
0	"Exasperatingly supercilious and smug - unfocused, self-consciously cute, nostalgic and empathetic, but never properly funny. It feels like someone else's long therapy session."
1	"Eras and generations mingle productively in this film. It's a social-historical mural that exists in flexitime, where America the Beautiful is an eternal and unassailable dream."
1	"There are louder films jostling for attention out there. This one is the secret treasure of the season, though - crafted with tender precision, and built to last."
1	It's a nice film with some great moments but Mills' touch is too tentative to make all that talk buzz and hum as resonantly as it should.
0	Unwatchable even by the subterranean standards of a direct-to-video Nicolas Cage thriller... 211 is the kind of low-grade schlock that leaves you with a newfound respect for the basic competence that most bad movies bring to the table.
0	It's probably foolish to wish that Nicolas Cage would once again make movies as good as Adaptation and Leaving Las Vegas. But is it too much to ask that he go back to the comparative glory days of Con Air and The Rock?
0	"Unsurprisingly, the director doesn't get very good work from a cast asked primarily to ramp up the intensity on stereotypes."
0	"Even the subset of Nicolas Cage fans who like it when the actor makes laughably terrible movies will have trouble sitting through ""211""..."
0	"A muddled, overcrowded, trigger-happy heist movie brimming with clichs while constantly trying our patience."
0	A cavalcade of crap. Loud crap.
0	"Despite a high body count and the expenditure of extraordinary amounts of ammunition, 211 is inert."
1	"Two/One escapes the pretentious tone it might have carried thanks to the self-assured way he grounds characters in the vivid, precise, beautifully shot details of their lives."
0	"The rare example of an exceptionally well-made film, from an undeniably talented filmmaker, in which everything works beautifully except the central premise, which doesn't work at all."
1	"It's a beautifully composed, enigmatic movie with a high-concept plot about two men on either side of the planet who are mysteriously connected by midlife despair and existential emptiness."
0	"Nowhere to go, nothing to say. Just a cute narrative concept that ultimately eats itself."
1	A raucous boys' night comedy that goes for the outrageous and hits it often enough.
0	21 and Over is pretty much for people with an IQ of 21 and under.
0	"A cynical college-age ""Hangover"" redo with far, far fewer fully developed characters or inventive adventures. (And that's saying something.)"
0	"Bleech. Tasteless. Even worse, unfunny."
0	"You can't hate 21 & Over, and you can't laugh at it. The most you can do is just pity it for not being as outrageous as it thinks it is. And as any guy will tell you, being pitied is the ultimate humiliation."
0	"An alcohol-fueled journey that becomes progressively more farfetched and, as the film's run time ticks on, increasingly unwatchable."
1	"Writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore find a nice balance between the over-the-top high jinks and an emotional core, which unexpectedly crystallizes relatively late in the movie."
1	"This play-it-safe debut delivers, but doesn't exactly surprise, proving Lucas and Moore like their protagonists wasted, but not their opportunities."
0	...condenses the familiarity of so many other party-hearty romps into 93 harried minutes.
0	"21 & Over seems particularly redundant, since a film already exists that's exactly like The Hangover, only not as good: It was called The Hangover Part II."
1	"While comparisons to ''The Hangover'' are inevitable, ''21 & Over'' is actually reminiscent of a different and specific kind of movie: the early Vince Vaughn-Jon Favreau romp."
0	These guys get into more trouble in one night than members of this film's target audience will encounter in their entire college lives.
0	"All, or at least some, might be forgiven if there were just one likable character or memorable joke."
0	"Among the ingredients ""21"" is missing: the infectiously random silliness of a Zach Galifianakis, the smug hunkiness of a Bradley Cooper, and any sort of Vegas-y gloss whatsoever."
1	"21 & Over powers along with a winning Abercrombie bonhomie, IE naked guys and racism. Hilarious racism."
1	21 & Over provides lots of fun while the beer flows. Too bad the R.A. felt like he had to come in and ask everyone about their major.
0	Lucas and Moore don't bother to come up with a single funny joke. Instead they apparently hope that combining racist and sexist insults with unfocused mayhem will be diversion enough.
0	Everything is done to excess with the needle on the gross-out meter buried in the red.
0	This is comedy on a familiar train where every stop is reassuringly predictable.
0	"I don't think I've ever seen someone ralph in super-slo-mo while riding a mechanical bull before, so kudos for originality there, I guess."
1	One of those brashly formulaic all-night-long youth-party flicks that's redeemed by the speed and personality of the actors.
0	"In the end, 21 and Over is more exhausting - and exhausted - than funny or wild."
0	Dire.
0	In the 21st century the only intelligent people who can be pardoned for questioning evolution are those watching films such as 21 and Over.
0	"Miles Teller certainly has a way with a wisecrack. But otherwise, file next to Broken Lizard's execrable Beerfest."
1	"If we must have three horny fools getting their rocks off during a wild all-nighter prefabricated for cult appeal, at least it's these three, whose combined bonhomie could get just about any party started."
0	"The final implication that this is how you grow up and find yourself makes one fear for the future of US youth. And, indeed, America itself."
1	"This movie knocks you out with an astonishing blend of hyper-realism, visual complexity and powerful themes."
1	"A sad movie about the irony of inescapable destiny, it left me captivated and trembling."
1	"You won't come out unaffected, because the depths of intimacy that the Mexican director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu plumbs here are so rarely touched by filmmakers that 21 Grams is tantamount to the discovery of a new country."
1	"It's a startlingly crafted movie, with several extraordinary performances."
1	"This film has great performances all around, especially from Naomi Watts in maybe her best role yet."
1	"Watts, who has the most difficult scenes, is splendidly mercurial; what's surprising is that those professional storm clouds Penn and Del Toro are here as powerfully restrained as she is electrifying."
1	It's one of those motion pictures that haunts your thoughts and won't let go.
1	"Unstintingly explores and exposes excruciating pain, raw grief, ruinous vengeance and life-affirming resilience, creating human portraits that are uncommonly exhilarating in their honesty."
1	"Watts, Penn and Del Toro have all been brilliant before, and if we're lucky, they will all be brilliant again. But to watch these three -- working alone and in tandem -- is to experience the strange, at times frightening alchemy of screen acting."
1	You won't see more explosive acting this year.
1	"The three leads are superb, as are Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg in supporting roles."
1	A good movie which just misses being great.
1	"Using the structure of Amores Perros, Inarritu takes his complex tale of hope and redemption and breaks it into a mosaic of emotional tiles that add up to more than the whole."
1	"The title refers to the weight -- perhaps the soul -- the body is said to lose at the precise moment of death. But 21 Grams has no shortage of soul, wit or intelligence."
1	"Watching Penn and Del Toro (and, to a lesser extent, the actually young and actually beautiful Watts) navigate the recesses of these damaged, ambivalent characters ... is pretty much worth the price of admission."
1	"This may be the most brilliantly made movie of the year. But you don't enjoy 21 Grams, you recover from it."
1	Boasts so many moments of sublime acting that it's hard to know where to start.
0	Confounded my high expectations by being much too depressing for my taste.
1	"Blessed with one of the strongest casts of any American movie this year, this bravura film, with its radical structure, is full of risk and reward."
0	"If not for its show-offy back-and- forthing of time, the movie would be a banal, pointlessly depressing exercise."
1	"Tough, smart, relentless, provocative and, above all, serious."
1	"Watching it is a wrenching experience; the usual layers of distance between actors and audience are stripped away, and we not only watch their anguish, but become part of it."
1	"Inarritu and Arriaga's first English-language film doesn't approach the brilliance of Amores Perros, but it succeeds on a more modest scale."
1	"It grips us, moves us, astonishes us."
0	"A capital-M movie, and the most flagrant kind: Heavy emotion, heavy style, and lite philosophy converge and choke us with meaning."
1	"This is cinematic storytelling of a very high order, and the clear work of a moviemaker who has almost instantly established himself as a force to be reckoned with."
1	"Though not depressing, because nothing this good is, the film is haunting -- a walk on the razor's edge between life and death."
0	Is the strategy to make you work so hard to determine where you are in the timeline that you overlook what a dreary and conventional little soap opera this is?
1	"The performances, the way Inarritu deconstructs and reconstructs the narrative, the grainy, gritty feel and look, all lead to the rare sort of experience that only a truly great film can offer."
1	This is a mesmerizing film that is the work of genius.
1	"Every year needs a challenging masterwork, a movie that defies filmmaking convention and leaves an indelible mark on the collective psyche."
1	"One of the most riveting and moving experiences of the year, a movie of aching soulfulness and transforming power."
1	Challenges and provokes in unexpected ways.
1	"[An]uncommonly ambitious, superbly acted, frustratingly flawed drama."
1	Establishes [Inarritu] as a major cinematic force.
1	You won't soon forget the world that Gonzalez Inarritu creates.
1	Fascinating because of the way the story is told -- and because of the existential issues that it forces you to consider.
0	"A bleak, rather obvious melodrama disguised by a tricksy, time-splicing structure."
1	21 Grams soars into the chilly empyrean of first-class film-making by virtue of the most traditional of values: sympathetic characters and clever plotting.
1	"The helmers make slick use of their new live-action collaborators. Considering that hardly anyone was asking for a 21 Jump Street reboot, they've put their own playful stamp on it."
1	Co-directors Lord and Miller keep the comic pace humming along agreeably with the same sort of animated energy they provided for those raining meatballs.
1	"It has a bad, slapstick first act but by midpoint becomes strangely compelling, tapping into the fantasy of reliving one's high-school years (which did a number on us all) and getting it right."
1	"Thanks to charming leads and a smattering of laughs, this is still worth a punt for fans of light buddy comedies."
1	"Rather than treat the late-'80s source material as holy kitsch, the filmmakers have reconceived this tale of illegal narcotics and arrested adolescence as a viciously satirical, unapologetically crude buddy comedy."
1	"This is not a property requiring respect and devotion to the source material to satisfy longtime fans, so the filmmakers wisely make a ""21 Jump Street"" all their own."
1	"Though these mismatched cops bounce well off each other, Tatum, in his first comedic lead role, is the better performer, both more riotous and affecting."
1	"Not everything... works, and if you're actually looking for a consequential night at the movies you might want to stay away, but for a goofy fun Friday night this gets the job done."
1	What makes 21 Jump Street so funny and exciting and lovable is all the stuff you don't see coming.
1	"What was the last stupid Hollywood comedy -- good-stupid, not stupid-stupid -- to offer actual, audible, verifiable big laughs?"
1	It's part homage and part wink at the past. It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years. It bridges slapstick and action. It's quick-witted with its pop references.
1	"Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller get nearly everything -- the tone, the self-referential nods to the show and the dead-solid-perfect surprises -- just right."
0	"Yes, there are laughs to be had here, but I wonder whether it might be more amusing to watch episodes of the old TV show."
1	"I didn't think we needed a '21 Jump Street,' but it's actually kind of funny."
1	Miller and Lord clearly understand the push-and-pull and hyper-competitiveness that make guy friendships both complex and stupid.
1	"It's that rare comedy that's funny throughout, with a hilarious story that hinges on the unlikely pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum."
0	"The basic premise -- that these two are supposed to be high school age and siblings -- is funny, but the joke, as is true of many others in this movie, is replayed way too often."
1	"21 Jump Street makes a virtue of low expectations, like an underachieving high school burnout coasting on his modest reserves of charm."
1	"This cheerfully chaotic, gleefully vulgar action-comedy retread of the old television series has box-office success written all over it, and where's the harm? It's irresistibly funny until it isn't."
1	"In its outrageous way, 21 Jump Street has real laughs."
1	"It was inevitable that one of Hollywood's many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience. Hence the arrival of 21 Jump Street, a film that not only knows it's a remake, but knows how absurd it has to be to succeed as a remake."
1	"Neither man has had a better foil. They are literally and figuratively trying to bring something out of each other, and they do."
1	"This film is even better if you come in with no spoilers and low expectations, so we will build it up no more."
1	This potty-mouthed and drug-laced reimagining of the 1980s TV show has one of the highest laughs-per-minute ratios since the Naked Gun films.
1	Tatum and Hill steamroller any misgivings right from the start. They take a comedy connection that seemed doomed to fail - pairing Tatum's hunky command with Hill's nerdy neediness - and make it look like the most natural thing in the world.
0	"Much of the humor involves trotting out cliches from cop movies and teen movies, then commenting on how dumb they are."
1	"21 Jump Street earns my genial nod because of its limber, 120-IQ take on the whole notion of movie revivals."
1	"The makers of 21 Jump Street clearly understood that almost nobody really wanted a 21 Jump Street movie, and they've cleverly used a familiar property as a way to get a wildly entertaining new comedy made."
1	"Big surprise: The sometimes chaotic ""Jump Street"" is a lot of ridic fun, as the kids say, turning predictability on its head."
1	"The saving grace of ""21 Jump Street,"" co-written and produced by Hill, is its obvious affection for teen genres, and for teenagers."
1	"Even if you think you've graduated from genital jokes and violent slapstick, the laughing gas around ""21 Jump Street"" may get you hooked."
1	One of the freshest mainstream comedies in years.
1	"The film makes high school comedy feel young again: considering its stars are in their late 20s and early 30s, that's no mean feat."
1	"Completely abandoning earnest teenagers-in-crisis melodrama in favor of crude, aggressive comedy, this ""21 Jump Street"" is an example of how formula-driven entertainment can succeed."
1	"It's mostly another raunchy buddy comedy - albeit one with welcome comic discipline, more focused on maintaining pitch than continually lowering the bar on gross-out jokes."
1	"Less an adaptation than an ""adaptation"" that delights in highlighting the ridiculous clichs and tropes it lampoons."
1	"Here's the last movie I was expecting with this title. In other words, ""21 Jump Street"" is pretty good."
1	"The whole crew makes clear its affections for action cinema, trashy television and the YouTube generation alike while having fun at the expense of all three."
1	"A raucous, raunchy comedy."
1	This bracing new take on 21 Jump Street has a playful spark all its own. It's a blast.
0	"A try-anything, fitfully amusing muddle that wears its mocking cynicism a bit too proudly."
1	"""21"" makes clear from the beginning it is gobbling up some pop culture refuse in the name of nothing more than making fun of it and having fun with it."
1	This is the funniest movie I've seen in more than a year.
1	"""21 Jump Street"" might be yet another product of Hollywood's recycling program, but it deserves to be noticed."
1	"The late-eighties TV series is rebooted with jolts of sentiment, personal discovery, and wild comedy."
0	[Plays] more like a distended awards show package than a proper documentary ...
1	"The luminaries in ""21"" pay deserving tribute to Mr. Linklater. Soon, perhaps, so will the Academy."
0	"""21 Years: Richard Linklater"" makes for a disappointingly hollow hagiography: gushy, superficial and strangely overdue - arriving significantly later than its title prescribes."
1	"There are great clips and good insight, and it's all as loose and cool as an Austin night out."
1	"There's a certain satisfaction in a rundown of a career as rich and varied as Linklater's, not unlike the pleasure of watching a well-edited Oscar tribute reel."
0	An amiable but wholly unnecessary movie that plays like a feature-length version of those reels one watches while eating rubbery chicken at a banquet honoring a much-loved artist.
0	"Feels slapped together, something you'd see at an awards dinner, save for the dippy cartoon segments, which considering the subject's creative use of animation (""A Scanner Darkly""), undercut every anecdotal stab at thoughtful analysis."
0	"With a movie like this, it's hard to tell where the good idea ran out, as it seems to have been lost many drafts ago."
0	"When the chief baddie both stutters and slaughters puppies, you know you're in trouble."
0	"A generic, derivative gangster yarn."
1	"Its many memorable characters, adrenalin-charged action sequences and heart-stopping car chases make for a guilty pleasure."
1	"'22 July' offers few surprises, and even fewer opportunities for Paul Greengrass to flex his filmmaking muscles."
1	"Greengrass' docu-real aesthetic doesn't allow for grandiosity even when he gives in to more heavy-handed impulses. He's on a soapbox at times, but his message is worth hearing."
1	22 July is a brave and careful film.
1	"A sharp, scouring work of moral seriousness from Greengrass."
1	"It's both a pulse-pounding depiction of the deadly attacks that shook Norway in 2011 and a sober investigation of the aftermath, evolving into a gripping courtroom drama and a tremendously emotional personal account of one family's struggle to move on."
1	"It's intelligently stern, storm-gray filmmaking, as we've come to expect from Greengrass; if it feels a bit mechanical as well, perhaps this is a near-impossible story to film with both tact and soul."
1	"Small, vicious moments...define a film that's admirably lacking in histrionics. Its restraint makes the courtroom climax hit even harder."
1	[A] violent and harrowing film...
0	Greengrass puts his audience through the ringer for little reason other than to prove he can effectively dramatize such a horrible event.
1	"This might be the first Greengrass movie that doesn't just make you flinch, it makes you cry."
1	"This is a heartfelt piece of work from Greengrass, but the blaze of passion is missing."
1	"It is a subtle, multi-layered and very affecting drama that confronts the darkest episode in recent Norwegian history but still manages to strike a redemptive note."
1	"Greengrass gives ""22 July"" everything he's got. The filmmaking is vigorous, with a constantly moving and sometimes jittery camera, and the social purpose is worthy and unmistakably sincere."
1	"With tenderness and toughness, Greengrass has made a great film about a terrible act."
1	"22 July is at its most engrossing and moving in its depiction of one brave kid, a victim of Breivik who was shot five times and lived, and that kid's eventual resolve to face the terrorist in court."
0	What does Greengrass hope to achieve with a film like this?
1	"22 July is exceptionally choreographed and tough to sit through, but it also leaves an uneasy, bitter aftertaste..."
1	"It's likely only a filmmaker of Greengrass' experience and stature could have gotten it made at all, let alone so successfully."
1	The result is that what starts out harrowing ends up affirming a portrait of a country that unites to make the tragedy of 22 July count for something - the strength of their national character.
1	"Greengrass has once again composed a gripping, sometimes unbearably stressful re-creation of horror, so true to life that the ""why"" of it all is just as inscrutable as life itself."
1	"Greengrass previously excelled at depicting events that overwhelmed individuals; in ""22 July,"" he demonstrates how one deluded zealot can shake an entire country."
1	22 July is so good it hurts.
0	"The film is about atmosphere and anger, and Greengrass achieves that effect through tight focus on individuals. But the result is imperfect, because it elides crucial elements of the whole story."
1	"Paul Greengrass' gritty, live-wire directing style is something of a trademark, and it's put to efficient use in 22 July, a layered, dense look at the savage terrorist attack that rocked Norway on that date in 2011."
1	Director Paul Greengrass' latest docudrama re-enacts the 2011 massacre in Norway with chilling accuracy - but stumbles when revisiting the details of the aftermath.
0	"Fiction that hews close to fact, the movie is serious and meticulous, yet hollow."
0	What a perverse niche Paul Greengrass has carved out for himself.
0	"It gives this evil man the spotlight and platform he so clearly craves. And as much as Greengrass is aware of this conundrum, he never quite figures out a solution."
1	"If 22 isn't as trim and tight as its predecessor, it's certainly smarter and more heartfelt. Whether this sequel is better than the original is up for debate, but the franchise has definitely grown up."
1	"For once, cranking out a play-it-safe sequel yields something satisfying."
1	There's enough goodwill to balance out the clunky bits.
1	"Sticks snugly to the prior film's winning formula, mining the resultant doublings and repetitions for maximum absurdist hilarity."
1	"Tatum is, predictably, adorable. His Jenko is a pumped-up naf bumbling through life with a crooked smile, and Hill again makes a great sparring partner."
1	"For all its self-reflexive jokes, 22 Jump Street is a very traditional affair that offers audiences the same pleasures as Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello or even Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin films."
1	[Lord and Miller] are fast becoming the handiest duo to share a viewfinder since the Coen brothers.
1	Lord and Miller have their cake and eat it. Again. Will they now go for the threepeat?
1	A movie that made me feel guilty for laughing quite so much.
1	"Tatum and Hill are just a really great double act, as different and thus well matched as Laurel and Hardy, complementing each other perfectly."
1	"...this will be the most ""meta"" movie ever made..."
1	"Hill and Tatum make a classic and highly successful comedy team, balancing a series of amiable running gags and the most familiar kind of slapstick."
1	Hill and Tatum ... have a Laurel-and-Hardy-like implausible chemistry that keeps you laughing pretty much no matter what they're doing.
0	"What's the difference between ""21 Jump Street"" and ""22 Jump Street""? Same as the difference between getting a 21 and a 22 at blackjack."
1	"""22 Jump Street"" realizes its main goal is to be ridiculously fun and that to do so it must be utterly ridiculous, as well as in on the joke."
1	This is the ultimate meta movie. The repetition is exactly the point.
1	Hill's neurotic-motormouth act and Tatum's lovable-lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks.
1	"This sequel's spoof of its predecessor's riff on the original 1980s-era buddy-cop TV show coalesces into a raucous, raunchy, irreverent, imperfect riot."
1	"Lord and Miller are on a roll, and there may be no better moviemakers at playing to our modern need for irony - at giving us the entertainment we crave while acknowledging our distrust of it."
1	"If it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldn't possibly exceed their over-the-top buddy cop antics of 21 Jump Street, you lost that bet."
1	What separates 22 Jump Street from sequel mediocrity is that everyone's in on the joke.
1	Remember that feeling when you realized The Hangover II was A sequel that has as many laughs as a Texas spring has tornadoes.
1	"Like its stars, ""Jump Street"" gets extra credit for getting by on charm while sticking to the rules."
1	"It doesn't have the pleasant surprise factor of the first film, but it's actually even better."
1	"Enjoyably light on its feet, even when it's self-consciously treading old ground."
1	"It works well enough, more often than not, though heightened levels of raunch and chaos seem not so much meta as frantic."
0	"22 Jump Street may be the most arbitrary sequel since Bad Boys II. If it's not the worst, that's strictly because of Channing Tatum."
0	The movie is crammed with jokes about how bad sequels are. And guess what? Exactly.
1	"An exploding piata of gags, pratfalls, winking asides, throwaway one-liners and self-reflexive waggery."
1	"""22 Jump Street"" is exactly what comedy is today. It's coarse, free-flowing and playful."
1	"A self-aware sequel has to hop over hurdles to keep from swallowing its own tail, but the sharp writing and tag-team antics lift ""22 Jump Street"" to a high level."
1	"22 Jump Street is damn funny, sometimes outrageously so. It laughs at its own dumb logic and invites us in on the fun."
1	"A brazen sequel that's both slightly disappointing and a reliable, often riotous ""laffer"" in the old Variety trade-magazine parlance."
0	"Nearly two hours of rationalizing repetition, even by winking at it, can get wearying."
1	"Ironically, 22 Jump Street is kept together by the formula it ceaselessly mocks."
1	"What makes it all work is the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, which in turn, of course, is a rich source of the film's humor."
1	A genial class clown of a movie.
1	"Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick, having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream and Austin Powers, but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor."
1	Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second-best film of the year (behind The Lego Movie).
1	Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who are themselves impressive partners at this point) know enough not to mess with a successful formula.
0	"22 Jump Street has the same writers and directors as the first film. But it's not smart this time as much as it is clever, and that cleverness tips into spottiness and cynical self-congratulation."
1	"Jump Street knows you know about the predictability and cheapness of sequels and rip-offs -- and in this case, to avoid the downfalls of other summer comedy sagas, embracing that problem might have been the best move for this absurd, unique franchise."
1	"Though I enjoyed enormously this latest offering in the rebooted Jump franchise, it's the effortless, unexpected bromance/partnership between the two unlikely undercover cops is what makes this franchise work."
1	"There's something going on at the edges of the frame in practically every scene of 22 Jump Street, a testament to the care and attention to detail directors Lord and Miller bring to this potentially silly material."
1	"They get to poke fun at sequels and simultaneously make sequel money, which is a great frigging gig if you ask me."
1	"It takes the homoerotic energy bubbling under the surface of buddy action pictures and raises it into the sunlight, where it can flex its pecs and growl."
1	That Stoner No. 3 from Knocked Up and the tank top from Step Up have become Hollywood's freshest comedy duo is impressive.
0	"At what point is sarcasm just a cheap substitute for wit? Exactly when does joking about how all sequels are just lame, repetitive cash-grabs start to suggest that maybe yours is, too? Actually, in this case, about 40 minutes in."
1	"There's no real reason ""22 Jump Street"" should work. Yet it does."
1	Does the meta-acknowledgment that everyone's in it for the bucks give a purposefully dopey sequel more cred? ... You bet.
1	"22 Jump Street is pretty much the exact same movie as 21 Jump Street. It knows it, you know it, and it knows that you know it. And that is why it's brilliant."
1	"22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by."
1	"This sequel to the hit action comedy 21 Jump Street is better all around: the pacing is more consistent, the sight gags more imaginative, the self-referential jokes sharper."
0	"'22 Jump Street' tries to catch a meta-wave on the shoulders of its stars, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum."
0	"Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, have clearly seen their share of crappy unnecessary sequels, and want to assure us that 22 Jump Street will follow proudly in that tradition."
1	"The boom-and-bust cycle that afflicts company towns in capitalist countries also dogs the state-run cogmakers, as Chinese auteur Jia Zhang-ke lyrically depicts in 24 City, an ode to changing times."
1	"With this moody and curiously effective follow-up to his critically acclaimed drama Still Life, director Jia Zhang-Ke paints another vivid portrait of China devastated by commercial 'progress.'"
1	"Jia is one of the guiding lights of the sixth generation of Chinese filmmakers, and 24 City is a potent exploration of his constant theme-the tectonic shifts that occur as the old gives way to the new."
1	"This subversively old-fashioned hymn to industrial production is filled with offbeat, vaguely absurd details."
0	"Mostly, 24 City falls into the same Jia trap of inadvertently drawing the viewers' gaze past his human subjects and to the poetic images of a country in painful metamorphosis."
1	"The result is surprisingly engrossing -- even lively, due in part to brief musical numbers inserted amid the interviews."
1	"Mr. Jia is an artist, one of the most interesting filmmakers working anywhere in the world, and he made his film to bear witness to a way of life while witnesses could still be found."
1	"The actors in 24 City, an experimental fiction-nonfiction hybrid, bring their own existential realities to their short, touching performances."
0	"24 City won't change the minds of detractors -- it is his most painfully slow yet -- but it might change the minds of his supporters, including this critic, for Jia attempts something that is, in the end, unforgivable."
1	The director has an exquisite eye that keeps getting stronger and subtler. He trusts that beauty is vagueness's alluring upside.
0	"Chinese arthouse fixture Jia Zhang Ke looks at the closure of a state-owned factory in Chengdu, combining real interviews with awkwardly am-dram mock ones."
1	"The film takes on an operatic feel, moving between euphoria for the new and lament for the lost."
1	"A deeply serious and sombre film, trying to find a way of telling the stories of people affected by the gigantic political and economic changes sweeping that country whose concerns must in the end affect us all: 21st-century China."
1	"Enthralling, beguiling and haunting."
1	Zhangke never hints much about politics ... His is more the story of ordinary people caught up in history and still determined to live their lives as well as they can. It's both relevant and resonant.
1	"History weaves in and out of faces that purl their monologues -- real or scripted -- as Jia presents the past as a giant, invisible river."
1	"24 City includes evocative footage of Factory 420's dismantling, but emphasizes people over place."
1	"In [Jia Zhangke's] chronicle of the changing fortunes of a defunct but once glorious aeronautic factory and its workers through talking heads and wordless images exclusively, the documentary strain prevails to simple, yet emotionally reverberating effect."
1	"Strongest moments are when the pristine HD lensing by Hong Kong's Yu Lik-wai (a Jia regular) and Wang Yu, and warm string music by Yoshihiro Hanno, take over in montages showing the gradual dismantling of the factory."
1	A blend of documentary and drama which is by turns movingly authentic and deliberately artificial.
1	"Through interviews with retired workers and faux interviews with scripted characters, Jia brings long-repressed history to life on an intimate scale."
1	"The film is not always subtle... but remains captivating as a pure procedural that raises questions about the Paris police's handling of such situations, as well as about the state of race relations in contemporary France."
0	"Would that the film had explored such emotional contradictions in greater detail, but this retelling is more concerned with black-and-white morality, which drains it of suspense."
1	"Knowing the outcome behind the true-life tragedy ""24 Days"" doesn't diffuse the horror, the tension or the sadness of watching one family's drama unfold day after agonizing day when a son is kidnapped and hope dies."
1	24 Days takes strength from real-world specifics. But the most powerful thing about the movie is its rejection of omniscience. The crime it reconstructs is beyond understanding.
0	"Sadly, ""24 Days"" isn't nearly as involving as it should be."
1	"As a suspenseful true crime story, ""24 Days"" succeeds. As a warning against the ever present dangers of anti-Semitism, it is eloquent and disturbing. It's in combining the two that Arcady mishandles the case."
1	"24 Days is neither subtle nor particularly sophisticated as filmmaking, but its refusal to reduce lived reality to generic tropes is admirable."
1	"[It] has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as it's based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France today."
0	This outing will please Swanberg's followers but lacks the polish required to attract a broader genre audience.
0	It's too high-minded to offer the cheap comforts of genre but too low-minded to skip one last chance to ogle the kind of woman viewers might have a crush on in real life.
1	"In this sleek yet confessional drama by the prolific filmmaker Joe Swanberg, the boundaries of art and life are probed with a knowing yet uneasy directness."
0	"The movie ultimately becomes a queasy bromance, the foundation of which is less than flattering."
0	"Unfortunately, this would-be erotic thriller is just too unfocused and slapdash to satisfy its promise."
0	"Improvised dialogue can work wonderfully if the actors have a solid feel for their characters, but everyone here seems rushed and uncomfortable."
1	"24 Exposures isn't entirely successful, though it is packed with ideas, alternately following and subverting conventions in a way that recalls Larry Cohen's 1980s output-specifically Cohen's snuff-film-themed Special Effects."
0	"Is Swanberg pre-empting complaints about his methods by making a film about an artist who is, if not a killer, then at least creepy and unreflective? Maybe, maybe not. But the question will only interest people who follow Swanberg's career."
0	Some half-baked ideas about representation versus reality emerge in the lax improvised dialogue.
0	"24 Exposures comes across like a clever idea that never got past the concept stage. It might have been fun for him to make, but it's definitely a chore to sit through."
1	"Thanks to an excellent script from Frank Cottrell Boyce, brilliant cinematography by the legendary Robby Muller and intelligent direction by Winterbottom, the film is constantly amusing and fascinating."
1	Bracing wit and boundless energy.
1	"Like the music, the film is outspoken, roaringly funny, defiantly sexual and relentlessly in your face. I couldn't have liked it more."
1	The Manchester creation myth is thrillingly re-enacted.
1	"A scrappy pop docudrama that's as mod, odd, and ironic as its subject."
1	"It's worthwhile alone for Mr. Coogan's fine portrayal of Mr. Wilson as a sly, cantankerous question mark of a man who provokes more queries than he answers."
1	The rare film about rock that actually captures the anarchic essence of its subject matter.
1	"This wonderful party of a movie, as totally original as its hero, stamps on a smiley face that will linger for hours."
1	"The bad thing about 24 Hour Party People is that it's blindly ambitious, garishly self-indulgent and reckless with the truth. The good thing is it knows all these things. And the best thing is that it might be a great movie."
1	"24 Hour Party People is hilarious and cheeky -- and it's crammed with dozens of great musical numbers, along with the inevitable string of setbacks and tragedies as well."
1	"Amazing, rich in authentic period atmosphere and detail, an ever-changing cyclorama of a movie that contains and frames Wilson, who never is allowed to overwhelm it."
1	"The actors' performances are a mix of eerie mimicry and something more: a portrait of ambitious dreamers kicking around big notions and doing absolutely self-destructive, stupid things."
1	"If you're even vaguely a fan of any of the groups in 24 Hour Party People, you'd be an idiot not to see this film."
1	"Winterbottom has set a high, new standard with 24 Hour Party People, his funny, riveting look at the music scene that ruled Manchester, England, from 1976 to 1992."
1	"Winterbottom, who rarely makes comedies ... nevertheless appreciates Coogan's richly comic portrait and lets him run with it."
0	The manic swirl of characters (most speaking in thick Northern accents that are sometimes muffled and incomprehensible) may leave you exhausted and confused.
1	Smart and grabby enough to work even if you think 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' is a bummer of a fortune cookie rather than a Joy Division tune.
1	Shines with a kind of inspired madness.
1	Great good fun even if you spent the 1980s listening to Loverboy.
1	"Winterbottom captures the spirit of the times, although the film's camera shakes and psychedelic colour bursts may make many viewers feel like reaching for Gravol rather than Ecstasy."
1	So energized by the subject that it overflows with inventiveness.
1	Rave and dance music aficionados will be pleased to see an important chapter in their cultural history.
1	"Even if you have never heard of the Mondays, whose members swiftly self-destructed in Ecstasy and excess, or of Tony Wilson, the entrepreneur the film is about, you may find yourself drawn into the vortex created by director Michael Winterbottom."
1	"It's inaccurate to pin Manchester's rise as a musical mecca wholly on one person, but Wilson makes for a fascinating character study, and he's drolly played by Coogan."
1	Its wit and sense of fun open it up to people with only a passing interest in the music and the era.
1	"With enough verve and energy, if a not an absolute devotion to truth, to keep you dancing and thinking for days."
1	"A real party, but it's hard to keep track of the guests."
1	"Coogan, as the consummate overeducated, overly-erudite opinion leader, is spot-on perfect."
1	"How much you enjoy 24 Hour Party People, director Michael Winterbottom's raucous look at the Manchester, England music scene of the '80s, probably depends on your background."
1	Brilliantly realised and hilariously funny.
0	A fun and free-form celebration of the site's communal spirit and only-in-San Francisco ethos.
1	A diverting infomercial.
1	"Personalities are as engaging as they are diverse, while zippy, well-photographed package is never dull."
0	The disorganized documentary 24 Hours on Craigslist is primarily a stroll through human desire as manifested on the popular Internet site Craigslist.org.
0	It plays too much like a paid ad. Everybody interviewed had a positive experience. But what about those who didn't?
0	"Hawke delivers a workmanlike performance, but can't redeem the third act's macho baloney ..."
1	"So long as you turn your thinking cap off, this high-energy enterprise will provide plenty of less-than-highbrow fun."
1	"There's some reasonably ambitious choreography to a lot of the physicality and camerawork, and until it devolves into testosterone-drenched, operatic silliness, the mix of bullets, blood and banter is dumb fun."
0	Plotted like a Crank sequel and has dialogue that sounds like it was written by a teenage boy.
1	"This is mostly entertaining ridiculousness, threaded together by the reliable Hawke ..."
1	"Redemption is at its best when it focuses on action, not the after-action reports, and its best is awfully good."
1	"Redemption does set some nice, bouncy balls rolling for January."
1	"24: Redemption amounted to: a sweaty, very extended and occasionally rather soupy trailer for the new series that begins in January."
1	A serviceable although not exceptional place-setter.
1	Redemption didn't so much whet my appetite for the show's full-time return in January as it did remind me of the many problems I had with it the last time it was on the air.
1	"Benefits not only from the change of venue but also from the luxury of incorporating so many first-rate actors, including Robert Carlyle."
0	"But playing off the fears of Sept. 11, 2001, is, in 2008, played out. Jack Bauer as Superman, or even Underdog, is tired."
1	"For all its political ambitions, 24 remains the story of one man's journey, and [Kiefer] Sutherland shrugs himself back into the role as if it were a well-worn flak jacket."
0	"It's good, theoretically at least, to have Craven back. But why come back for this?"
0	"A thoroughly dreary, by-the-numbers exercise."
0	"Wes Craven's first new movie in five years is a brainless, joyless, and yes, you might even say, soulless teen slasher."
0	It's your money that's at greater stake with this subpar horror entry in barely noticeable 3D.
0	"This dumb, derivative teen slasher movie would be uninspiring coming from any writer-director, let alone one with several genre classics under his belt."
0	"A puzzle with no solutions, a tale with a twist that isn't a twist at all."
0	The worst horror movie Wes Craven's made perhaps ever.
0	"What sinks it is Craven's simplistic, ham-fisted writing and inert direction."
1	"There are plenty of formulaic boo! moments, yet Craven intelligently treats Bug's otherworldly issues like hormonal growing pains that must be tamed."
0	A thrill-free snooze that will certainly rank as one of the least -- if not the least -- effective entries in Craven's nearly 40-year canon of cinematic shockers.
0	"There's some malarkey about each kid having inherited one of the maniac's personalities, though Craven never does much with that except to point the finger of suspicion at junior."
1	"Character-driven pic provides strong opportunities for a fine ensemble of actors and for Lee, maintaining his signature style, to depart from his regular ethnic territory ... and to deliver one of his more interesting recent films."
1	Held together in the vise of a powerful script.
0	"There are two films at war in director Spike Lee's newest feature 25th Hour, one uninteresting, the other an epic of near-tragic miscalculation."
1	"Not a happy experience, and there are times when it seems to drag, but there's no denying that it lingers in the mind long after the impressions left by other movies have evaporated."
0	"The story line is flaccid and episodic, the direction lacks vitality, and the observations are mundane."
1	Spike's best since Do the Right Thing.
1	"See it for Edward Norton, who does his usual job of turning sackcloth into satin."
0	"The latest movie to prove that, for all his talent and ability to attract excellent actors, director Spike Lee has to quit overstuffing his narratives."
1	"If 25th Hour does not quite work as a plausible and coherent story, it produces a wrenching, dazzling succession of moods."
0	"A clumsy, oh-well story about the moral quandary of a drug-dealing recidivist who more or less deserves to go to jail."
1	"At its best, 25th Hour is a melancholy tone poem, deeply affecting in its mute apprehension of loss."
1	"As strong as the supporting cast is, Edward Norton really carries this film to a special status with his riveting performance."
1	"Lee, as he did in Malcolm X and Clockers, makes his hero's dread palpable, and though 25th Hour lacks the glittering brilliance of those films, I was held by the toughness and pity of Lee's gaze."
1	"It's a long, complex, deeply flawed work -- and also quite possibly Lee's most ambitious and accusatory movie since Do the Right Thing in 1989."
1	"It could have been more taut, could have been harder, but 25th Hour still resonates with power and poetry."
1	[Lee's] movies still have plenty on their mind. And they're not afraid to talk about it.
1	Norton and Lee make a great team.
1	Flawed but formidable.
1	"Lee is firing on all cylinders, and the actors match his energy."
1	A superb film.
1	"It's the usual undisciplined, overextended Spike symphony: more fun than it is any good."
1	"Lee has created that rarity in filmmaking: a movie we need, right now."
0	"25th Hour has a lot of problems, but chief amongst them is the persistent feeling that Lee is just treading water, by trading on past glories and larding in celebrity appearances in the hope of actually selling a few tickets for a change."
0	"An intriguing misfire that nonetheless holds our interest, keeping us wondering about the movie that might have been."
1	The first great 21st century movie about a 21st century subject.
0	Lee overloads a featherweight story with pretentious subtext and showy technique.
1	"The movie hums with a vibrant energy, which is powered by the terrific ensemble cast and the glowing cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto."
0	Well-acted but badly miscalculated.
1	"The film doesn't reach a climax per se. But it's not conventionally inert, either."
0	"If there was ever a filmmaker in need of someone who could tell him where and when to stop, what to leave in and what to take out, it would be Spike Lee."
1	25th Hour should have stopped at 24.
1	The film is unusual for not having a plot or a payoff.
0	Pretty lethargic stuff.
1	Lee and his cast are so adept at getting us acquainted with Monty and these other people that we wind up feeling like we've known them for years.
1	I still think that Mr. Lee has come closer than he ever has before to making the great film about New York City that David Thomson hoped from him in a favorable mini-bio in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film.
1	Lee's best picture in years.
1	25th Hour is the first film I've seen that explicitly catches the grief of New York City in the aftermath of 9/11.
1	
1	"Superbly acted, as you would expect, it's also rich in moral nuance. Doing the right thing is not as simple in his films as it once was."
0	"A turgid, bombastic and outrageously self-satisfied movie."
0	"While 25th Hour has a several arresting characters struggling with credible problems, regrettably Monty isn't one of them."
0	"It's an odd movie, maybe odder than it should have been if this is Lee's attempt to make a more widely accessible, less issue-based movie."
1	"Frothy, funny and formulaic, this pleasantly predictable romantic comedy may be viewed as another step forward for Katherine Heigl."
0	"While Heigl is terrific, this uninspired romantic comedy is considerably less so."
0	"It's white-lace porn for girls of every age, and the way that it revels in that get-me-to-the-altar mood, to the point of making anyone who isn't getting married feel like a loser, is the picture's key selling point."
0	"A forgettable, formulaic comedy so predictable that seeing it and skipping it are the exact same thing."
0	27 Dresses is an illustration of what can result when the filmmakers possess a solid understanding of the romantic comedy formula and decide never to stray from it by one iota.
0	"27 Dresses is so chock full of romantic-comedy clichs, it almost plays like a parody."
0	"A romantic comedy that -- despite her [Star Katherine Heigl] undeniable, apple-cheeked appeal -- sags like a day-old bouquet."
0	"27 Dresses dutifully privileges its formulaic plot over its stick-figure characters, slapping a happy ending on a setup that, say, Happiness director Todd Solondz could have gone to town on."
0	"Made 10 years ago, it probably would have starred a vacationing cast member from Friends."
0	"Under Anne Fletcher's mechanistic direction, 27 Dresses ticks along as briskly and transparently as a clock with a see-through face."
1	"If 27 Dresses were part of a wedding reception, it wouldn't be the bouquet toss, but it wouldn't be the Chicken Dance, either. It's more like the cake: mass-produced, maybe a little too sweet but enjoyable all the same."
0	"The biggest disappointment of 27 Dresses is that it inhabits a Harlequin romance New York City, one remarkably short on homosexuals and divorce."
1	"Certainly Heigl fares better in less formulaic fare, such as Judd Apatow's irreverent Knocked Up, but she does raise the level of this chick flick from bland to mildly entertaining."
0	"Anyone who has the slightest doubt about where this movie is heading probably leads a full and rich life that doesn't include watching romantic comedies like My Best Friend's Wedding, which covered this same ground with a lot more verve and humour."
0	"Well, if you can figure out how this story ends, you've probably got better things to do than watch 27 Dresses."
0	"All the plot elements that we're encouraged to care about in 27 Dresses resolve in a dud, and the only thing that feels good about the feel-good finish is that it means the movie's over."
1	"It's not one for the ages, but this comedy about the 'perpetual bridesmaid' suggests a romantic marriage between star and audience that could last and last."
0	27 Dresses makes the point that modern American weddings are all pretty much alike. The same could be said about modern American romantic comedies.
0	"Anyone who has seen a chick flick knows what is going to happen next, and next, and next..."
0	Anyone watching this appealing actress march toward the inevitable will wonder why she's settling for so much less than she deserves.
1	"The romantic comedy 27 Dresses provides [Heigl] with a chance to flex her comedic muscles, and her whip-smart delivery and timing are an indication that we may at last have a worthy heroine for the otherwise shaky future of romcom."
0	"The clichs, like the dresses, sashay in and out of this predictable if nicely fluffy chick-flick composite, which manages to crank out a few decent laughs when it isn't wasting time on a pair of deadly supporting characters."
1	"Katherine Heigl is a movie star. Even in a fluffy romantic comedy like 27 Dresses, she lights up the screen."
1	"Sorry, Sandra. Too bad, Meg. The mantle of movie cute queen has just been passed to Katherine Heigl, starring as the romantically challenged New Yorker of 27 Dresses."
0	"The romantic comedy 27 Dresses will work best for people who have never seen a romantic comedy. If you have, you might find it amusing to tally up the steals -- I mean, homages."
0	"My favorite performer in the movie, Judy Greer, is a deadpan killah as Jane's co-worker. She and Heigl deserve fresher stuff."
1	27 Dresses is one heck of a happy date movie. Smiling faces are guaranteed on all seen exiting when the credits finally do roll here.
1	"Eventually the contrivances win out, but the cast keeps it all watchable."
0	There's a decent movie in here somewhere. But the director and screenwriter have made a ditsy single-chick movie with the alluring geometry of a screwball comedy.
0	"Familiarity may be the central attraction of both weddings and romantic comedies, but the creators of 27 Dresses have taken a good thing too far."
0	"No self-respecting screenwriter would put a Hugh Grant character through what Heigl's endures here. I don't blame McKenna: I blame a studio system that figures if it worked for Julia Roberts, it will work for Heigl."
0	Talk about setting the woman's movement back by about a half-century.
0	27 Dresses is so flimsy it gives froth a bad name.
0	"Katherine Heigl carries 27 Dresses when all else fails, which it does with great regularity."
0	Another insult written and directed by women who deserve to be strung up by bridal veils
1	The humour's lively and just irreverent enough to make you laugh without offending your mum.
1	"hops along merrily enough thanks to an engaging turn from Heigl, who's nailed the unusually-pretty-girl-next-door act while embracing physical and risqu comedy."
0	A talented star is let down by a listless genre.
0	"The redeeming thing - and it's really all in Heigl's performance - is that Jane knows she's a silly clich, and spends most of the movie inwardly wincing at her own haplessness."
0	What a maddening waste of Katherine Heigl this insipid romantic comedy is.
0	"The story requires an antagonist, so Jane's sister is painted as a monster for most of the film. At the end, however, she is reshaped as Jane's close friend and confidante. The film's credibility crumbles like stale wedding cake."

1	28 Days is a reminder of why Bullock became a movie star in the first place
0	"28 Days is a cutesy, heavy-handed morality tale that contains nary a believable moment."
1	Sandra Bullock's best film in years -- perhaps even the best work she has ever done.
1	"28 Days may be fluff, but it's good fluff: effortless, amusing and almost touching."
0	Eminently likable Sandra Bullock has lately shown a bizarre knack for choosing hard-to-like movies. 28 Days continues her unenviable streak .
0	"Many of these 28 days are as pat and superficial as anything in a routine TV movie, making a frustratingly uneven film."
0	"It's not bad, but it's not very good, either."
0	It's going to take more than 28 Days to jump-start Sandra Bullock's stalled career.
0	"If I haven't said much about what actually happens in 28 Days it's because, trust me, you know what happens."
0	"The story and character arcs are pure Screenwriting 101, and every time something unexpected seems poised to happen, the script reaches out, grabs it and pulls it back in line."
0	"28 Days tries hard to be funny. Occasionally it is. But mostly it seems forced, pat and didactic."
1	Bullock gives it her all; she's bristling and alive on screen in a way that she hasn't been since Speed.
0	This is a movie afraid of its own shadows.
0	28 Days possesses all the depth and insight of a made-for-TV movie.
1	Bullock brings a kind of ground-level vulnerability to 28 Days that doesn't make her into a victim but simply into one more suitable case for treatment.
0	
0	28 Days is too glib too often to make much of an impression any way you look at it.
0	28 Days tries too hard to be all things to all people.
0	Thomas's fleet-footed approach suggests the anxious embarrassment of a director in an awful hurry to get it over with.
1	Sandra Bullock gives her best performance yet in 28 Days.
1	"With Sandra Bullock in the lead, writer Susannah Grant (Erin Brockovich) spinning the tale, and director Betty Thomas calling the shots, it's a reliably solid treat."
1	"28 Days isn't good enough or smart enough. But, doggone it, people just might like it."

1	A very well-made genre film with great performances and wonderfully staged sequences.
0	There is not an earthly glimmer of an original idea in the whole film.
1	"The zippy, brutal action sequences are gripping, the violence sometimes shocking."
1	"It flags during the encampment scenes, with some redundant gore, but this is a muscular, virile piece of film-making from Boyle."
0	A faux-low-budget zombie pic by director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland that shows a rather arrogant disdain for its audience in between occasional flashes of flair.
1	A swankily austere piece of jeepers-creepers sci-fi.
1	A movie that kept me involved from start to finish.
1	"Because it's cut-rate, star-free ... outlandishly edge-conscious, and 100 percent British, the movie has a frontier charge built in."
1	"108 bloody, B-movie minutes you're not likely to soon forget."
1	An unsettling and thought-provoking vision of a post-apocalyptic future.
1	An edge-of-your-seat scary movie that startles and chills.
1	"It's a zombie movie to make you forget how boring and simple-minded monster movies have become or, better yet, to make you remember how good monster movies can be."
1	"As a parable of human nature under extreme duress, 28 Days Later is never less than interesting."
1	28 Days Later induces the sort of physical reactions that these days are more often incited by the nightly news than the latest monster flick.
1	"For the most part, 28 Days Later is a smart, vivid nightmare with refreshingly unconventional heroes."
1	Has enough chills and thrills -- as well as plenty of nearly dead creatures -- to rank among the scariest and most ingenious horror movies in recent memory.
1	This is the stuff of which night tremors are made.
1	"Set in an evacuated London decimated by a virus, the film, shot with nerve-frying effectiveness on digital video -- creeps you out big-time."
1	"Deftly directed by Danny Boyle and scripted by novelist Alex Garland, 28 Days Later is seat-squirming, hands-over-the-eyes stuff."
1	"It's no Night of the Living Dead, but it's almost as scary and just as smart."
1	"A taut, terrifying thriller that will turn you asthmatic with dread."
0	"Despite this unusual setting (contemporary Britain in anarchy) and some good scenes, Boyle's new movie is mostly a zombie fiasco, closer to the vacuities of The Beach than the scintillating social satire of Trainspotting."
1	These B-movie thrills in post-apocalyptic England would make George Romero proud.
0	"Detestable, not just because its action is so vile or its technique so crude, but because its moral imagination is so impoverished."
1	"Director Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland have rebounded smartly from the bloated Leonardo DiCaprio debacle that was The Beach, their previous collaboration."
1	"It's unpleasant stuff, told without winks or humor, and it's so perfectly pitched that you can't take your eyes off it, even if this sort of hard-edged horror isn't exactly your cup of Diet Coke."
1	"It has eerie images, a compelling situation and an unusual capacity to surprise."
1	Derivative but horrifically effective.
1	"This smart, genuinely creepy movie also feels real, which is why its horrors hit so hard."
1	[Boyle's] back on British turf here and in fine dark form.
1	"The rare horror film that splatters and pauses to consider the splatter, that follows a traditional storyline and then improves upon it, and that avoids cliches while playing one out."
1	"If 28 Days Later falls short of classic horror movie status, Boyle pokes the genre with a sharp enough stick to prove it has some nasty life in it yet."
1	"This starkly beautiful, harrowing journey into the worst that can happen opens with video feed images of our unnatural disasters."
1	"A tough, smart, ingenious movie that leads its characters into situations where everything depends on their (and our) understanding of human nature."
1	"Terrifying on the basic heebie-jeebie level, respectful toward its B-movie forebears, and all the more unnerving for coming out in this fretful era of SARS and germ warfare."
1	"28 Days Later may be too obvious to score a knockout, but it's calibrated to satisfy genre fans, of whom there are many."
1	"The movie's great fun, but don't get any on you."
0	"A movie that's creepy and truly suspenseful in some places, unintentionally comic or plain awful in others."
1	"The movie is derivative as hell, but it's also blazingly well-made, and it moves at a ferocious clip."
0	"A grim slog through mud, rain and poorly lit corridors."
1	"I enjoyed watching this film, mostly because Murphy and Harris make such an appealing central couple to build a new world around. But nobody should mistake this for a killer-zombie movie with real soul."
1	... really creepy and really scary ...
0	"In the old days, a feverish programmer like 28 Days Later would end up on the bottom half of a double bill."
1	Boyle can't quite come up with anything to match the eerie brilliance of his opening. Never mind. It's all you need to see that his career is finally back on track.
1	"It makes for a more intimate brand of horror, one we can't explain away by pretending we're watching the same old well-oiled Hollywood malarkey."
1	Danny Boyle has got his edge back.
1	The movie's craft makes the dread of a killer virus contagious: viewers may feel they have come down with a case of secondhand SARS or sympathetic monkeypox.
1	"Heedlessly derivative though it may be, 28 Days Later does what it sets out to do and then some -- scare us out of our wits, then get us to apply those wits to an uncommonly intelligent and provocative zombie flick."
0	"Later does a lot of things right, which makes its third-act missteps even more frustrating."
0	"The picture is twitchy and annoying, flecked with blood and half-digested ideas, and too much is left unexplained."
1	Danny Boyle's purposeful direction and Mark Tildesley's imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy; the images of a wasted London and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive.
1	"What also makes 28 Days Later effective, and sets it apart from other thrillers, is that it makes you care about the characters."
0	"Lacking much dramatic or intellectual stimulation, it's ultimately a limp effort."
1	"In its own small way, in documenting two people who want to be together but are too scared to commit, Twenty-Eight Hotel Rooms is masterful."
1	"The intimate romantic drama ""28 Hotel Rooms"" should prove a fine calling card for its first-time writer-director, Matt Ross."
1	"Dismaying affectations aside-the characters go needlessly unnamed-the movie articulates the enduring allure of a love defined, and heightened, by restrictions."
0	"In eliminating all the filler, it ends up feeling like nothing but."
0	"""28 Hotel Rooms"" slowly expires for lack of air."
1	A chamber piece rooted in semi-improvisation.
0	"While Messina and Ireland are fine company, writer-director Matt Ross' conceit tires you out."
1	It validates my faith in the disreputable.
1	A full-bore zombie romp that more than delivers the genre goods.
1	Happy times! And superior horror. 28 Months Later can't come too soon.
0	"We've heard that before. And we've seen it all before, as this woeful sequel presents a strained story and a barrage of turgid action that looks like inferior outtakes from the first movie."
1	"As a pacy Saturday night shocker, it can't really be faulted."
1	"28 Weeks Later excels at creating a keen, creepy sense of a civilization stopped dead in its tracks."
0	"Another week, another disappointing summer sequel. So it goes..."
1	"A smashing horror film, frightening and thrilling."
1	"There's no better fun for movie lovers than a small, unheralded film that turns out to be terrific -- unless it's a small, unheralded sequel that trumps the original. Such is the case with 28 Weeks Later."
1	"28 Weeks Later lacks the streamlined thrust of its predecessor but makes for compelling, adrenaline-fueled viewing just the same."
1	"28 Weeks Later is brutal and almost exhaustingly terrifying. It is also bracingly smart, both in its ideas and in its techniques."
1	Still well equipped to rip your face off.
1	"Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, a Spanish director best known for Intacto, takes over for Danny Boyle this time around. He has a disconcerting gift for shock effects."
1	"The first hour of this lean, mean, 95-minute scream machine is so tasty that it redeems the predictable conclusion."
1	"Swift, vicious and grimly imaginative, 28 Weeks Later exceeds its predecessor in every way."
1	"Like 28 Days Later, this movie boasts a chilling atmosphere. The first film had a nightmarish ""Could this really happen?"" vibe running through it, boosted by the jittery photography and naturalistic acting. The new movie shares that feeling."
1	"It's an experience for the smart part of your brain as well as its more reptilian corners. We can enjoy the aesthetic qualities, even as we cringe pleasurably from the shock-and-awe entertainment values."
0	A screeching and wearyingly hyperbolic exercise in film-school nihilism that finds buried meaning in the term overkill.
1	"Bloodier and more action-filled than the original, Weeks nevertheless stays faithful to the grim, grimy tone director Danny Boyle established in his 2002 film with its haunting shots of a metropolis turned into a tomb."
1	The capital locations are put to cannily distressing use.
1	"Relentlessly grim and grisly, 28 Weeks Later is not for the faint of heart. But its provocative post-apocalyptic theme makes for a smart and deeply unsettling film."
1	A fiercely effective broadening and deepening of the first movie's premise.
0	"The social commentary is as subtle as -- well, a George Romero movie."
1	"Succeeds as both terrifying horror, gore-fest and, at times, serious drama."
1	Thematic resonance makes 28 Weeks Later stick to your nightmares. Hold on for a hell of a ride.
1	"A bloody, button-pushing shot of adrenaline."
0	"A frenetic killing machine -- illogical, telling in its grasp of human nature and utterly incapable of embracing the humanity it wants to show us."
0	"Like the first movie, it has a few ideas -- a few too many, perhaps. But new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is so determined to keep up the pace he explores them even less than Boyle did."
1	"28 Weeks Later has a stronger story line [than the original], equally fine performances, greater tension, enough gore to satisfy the most hard-core zombie fan, and a narrative pace that flings us from the opening scenes to the very last image."
1	"28 Weeks Later doesn't just recycle the premise, apocalyptic mood and insane violence of the original: It adds thematic layers to its zombie milieu, deepening the scares while justifying the sequel's existence."
0	Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo hurns out a straightforward cinematic gorefest that's competent and repulsive but not much else.
1	28 Weeks Later delivers jolts of fright with alarming regularity.
1	"Only occasionally does [director] Fresnadillo rise above the mundane, but, to his credit, the exceptions are worth savouring."
1	"Though it is in no way as original or terrifying or just plain brilliant as Danny Boyle's original work, Weeks will still offer horror fans plenty of tense and gory moments."
1	"Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has no problem re-creating the first film's naturalistic sense of dread and lurking menace and embellishing it. It's all shot on the run, with handheld cameras, mostly in the half-light of ruins and sewers."
0	"An hour and a half of high-voltage bombardment, 28 Weeks Later doesn't really match the novelty of its predecessor."
0	"28 Weeks Later underlines the fact that when you come back from the grave, you're not always looking so fresh."
1	"Terse, economical and infused with a low-fi feel that leaves its mark on everything from the film's light levels (low) to its music (mournful yet rocking), it's a sequel that surpasses the original."
1	"While the plot is relatively predictable, the pacing will keep audiences riveted and likely fascinated by the ways Fresnadillo and his team deliver death and mayhem."
1	Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo re-creates the gritty and spastic look of Days while brilliantly utilizing dark space and shadow to enhance the terror.
1	The worst horror is that the dark ending suggests a franchise in the making.
1	"These zombies didn't walk anymore, they marauded and chased their victims down like a pack of rabid dogs."
1	The age-old thrills of seeing monsters gouge a human's eyeballs have rarely been this elegantly packaged.
0	"The way is left open for more movies in a lucrative franchise: 52 Weeks Later, 104 Weeks Later, or maybe Nine 1/2 Weeks Later, the porn version with Kim Basinger."
1	"Combines traditional B-movie virtues -- economy, invention, sinewy narrative spine -- with the eerily resonant spectacle of a 21st-century metropolis stripped of its citizenry."
1	"Under Fresnadillo's assured direction, 28 Weeks Later blurs the line between genre entertainment and a photojournalist's shots of the next urban catastrophe."
0	The film rapidly degenerates into an Escape From Canary Wharf video game.
1	As eerie as the first and probably more scary.
1	"Even though I knew the scares were coming, I jumped out of my seat a few times."
0	"There isn't much acting here, but there is entirely too much vomiting, and the prose turns laughably purple, too."
1	"It's an exciting, well-directed thriller that, while providing more than enough action and gore to satisfy genre fans, also offers the political commentary that has characterized zombie movies."

0	Neither funny enough to be a comedy nor serious enough to pass for drama.
0	"This is one case where the director would have been better off pointing his camera at real subjects. The truth, in this case, is almost sure to be stranger than the fiction."
1	Good piece of work.
0	Spirited indie film that could be improved by a gifted editor.
1	"It's Tim Blake Nelson's character who keeps the plot from spinning out of control, because he has a natural and unforced respect for these women that he yanks his brother's chain and keeps their mission on course."
0	A scattershot culture-clash comedy that goes down like yesterday's foie gras.
1	A tantalizing Franco-American stew for audiences with a taste for bawdy humor and nutty characters.
1	Delpy has a sharp eye for cross-cultural comic clangers.
1	We've rarely seen comedy this smart since Woody Allen and Seinfeld left New York.
1	"This is Delpy's picture and she handles the writing-directing-starring juggler's act well, showing an insightful eye for cross-cultural quirks and modern mores."
1	"The set-up may feel a bit cheap, but Delpy doesn't belabour it, plunging us straight into zingy conversational back-and-forths where something crucial is always getting lost in translation."
1	"Reflection reveals a warm heart, sweet nature, and contemporary sensibility."
1	"As the cultural outrages and arguments escalate, I was increasingly grateful for the presence of Mingus, a necessary foil played by Rock as smart, sane, funny and at the end of his tether."
0	"The comedy in 2 Days in New York varies from uneven to failed. A lot of it isn't funny and some of what is, is overused."
0	"Phrases are misunderstood! Tolerance for Euro-libertine ways are tested! Tame encounters turn into terrifying humiliations, because the French are, like, so crazy!"
0	"Delpy's project of stripping the makeup from her charismatic screen persona extends, unfortunately, to a general slovenliness of technique."
1	"It's a pleasure to meet up again with Marion, the distractible, acerbic, New York-based French photographer played once more by Julie Delpy in 2 Days in New York."
1	"The film, which is about a chaotic 48 hours in Marion's life, succumbs to the chaos it depicts, and so undermines its best intentions. It is, all in all, a likable mess."
1	"The screenplay - which was written by Delpy, Landeau and Nahon - has a jittery kind of honesty about it, which Rock and Delpy sometimes push to its limits."
1	Julie Delpy is boundlessly appealing. And Chris Rock is acerbic fun. But the frenzied cross-cultural gags take the piss out of the real subject: how blood ties can turn love into a battlefield.
0	"Delpy and Rock click so well together that we'd much rather hang out at home with them, instead of racing around the city with sitcommish supporting characters."
0	At least we'll always have 2 Days in Paris.
0	"Without so much as a wink, it presents the French as racist, stinky, crude, self-absorbed, and obnoxious. It isn't a culture-clash comedy, so much as culture character assassination."
0	"It's time for Delpy to leave Marion in New York for good and head back to Paris. Besides, the sausage is better there."
1	"Delpy's good at keeping Marion's complaints sharp and funny, rather than wan and whiny. Even so, the movie's a bumpy ride as her good farcical instincts vie with the yen for cheap laughs."
0	"About six hours of those ""2 Days in New York"" don't work at all. And, coming as they do at the end, they tend to deflate the charm of the trip."
0	2 Days in New York plays like 2 years in Attica.
1	"It's extremely funny, one of the funniest films of 2012, with a particularly winning style - far-fetched, extreme and nonstop."
1	"Chatty, neurotic, maddeningly messy, often very funny, ""New York"" spins in a lunatic orbit of its own."
1	"Finds its comedy in the familiar annoyances of urban life (a contentious neighbor, random acts of vandalism), in the conflict between parents and siblings, but also in bigger, kookier, existential quandaries."
1	"The comedy works some of the time; the pathos, more so."
1	Julie Delpy has particularly impressed me over the years.
1	"""2 Days in Paris"" is as self-assured as it is slight, a deliberate diversion whose winsome charms never run dry."
0	"A manic and funny, if ultimately frustrating, sequel."
0	"Much of the alleged humor is based on French-English language gags, or cultural differences or continental mores vs. the priggishness of Americans, but it's all more irritating than funny."
1	"[Delpy] and Rock, in the midst of free-flying French chaos, find a sweet chemistry together ..."
1	"While it's nowhere near a perfect film, 2 Days in New York is worth seeing, not only for the comedy but also for the realism of the smaller moments."
1	"The laughs come fast and breezy, just as Delpy intends."
1	
1	"An utterly charming comedy of sexual manners that should do very well wherever audiences appreciate savvy dialogue and smart, observational filmmaking."
1	"An entertaining, deliciously played walk-and-talker by helmer-writer-star Julie Delpy and co-star Adam Goldberg."
1	"The movie should be seen with a large, responsive audience -- the better to live with it in the moment instead of worrying about where it's going."
0	This is not a vanity project. It is an insanity project.
1	"With the dithery Marion playing off Jack's nattering nebbish of negativism, Delpy invokes the Woody Allen-Diane Keaton chemistry of the '70s as consciously as Allen referenced the European art movies of the '60s."
0	It's uncomfortable to take a negative stance against something that is so plainly a labor of love. But the sad truth is that the movie doesn't offer enough to make it interesting or even diverting.
1	"Delpy's wry, acerbic sense of humor and privileged perspective make her the ultimate outsider-insider, perfectly positioned to ask the most astute questions."
1	That this one is even bearable is a surprise; that it's occasionally insightful and hilarious is a treat.
1	"Much of the nattery byplay seems improvised, and the results are very hit and miss -- inspired contretemps alternate with gabfests that seem to go on forever."
1	"As 2 Days in Paris zings along from one overamped frogs-vs.-Yanks clich to the next, two things happen: Delpy's direction begins to give the characters more air and space, and you adjust to its hectic pace."
1	[Delpy] stages it with a funny and diverting improv-y flow.
1	Some of it is funny and insightful; some makes you cringe. But it's still entertaining.
1	Delpy's humor [runs] to the black and the tossed off -- rather like her rather casual shooting style. She's more interested in hasty impressions than in formal elegance.
0	"Delpy's script is less a tale than it is a series of character-revealing snapshots, so the personalities are all we have to work with. And they are not personalities that wear well at feature length."
1	"The movie is just a situation salad, at least until the end, when things start to pull together a bit."
1	"Delpy wrote the dialogue that gives the film its forward thrust, and 2 Days is a wonderful first feature."
1	"The film [has] a wonderfully natural, comfy feel. Delpy is worth watching both in front of and behind the camera."
1	"For all the verbal jokery, it's more tragedy than farce."
1	Julie Delpy's and Adam Goldberg's performances are so assured and spontaneous that they don't even seem to be acting.
1	I thought it really captured what happens to couples often when they're not in their home base.
0	"Ms. Delpy and Mr. Goldberg are clearly talented and versatile enough to make a more plausible and convincing couple, but the helter-skelter view of Paris in this film never gives them the chance."
1	"Delpy is such an infectiously appealing personality, she almost wills this movie to work. And for laughs, Goldberg has some pretty funny moments as an eternally frazzled, put-upon neurotic who hates Paris and the French."
1	"Delpy's skill, which is considerable and wide-ranging, points to better, fuller films in her directorial future."
1	"Delpy has a knack for finding just the right details; filming in her own hometown, she fills the movie with funny cross-cultural observances."
1	It's possible to watch 2 Days in Paris and have absolutely no idea who's calling the shots. This is excellent news because it means that we gain a director without losing an actress.
1	"Satirical and casual in its approach, and Delpy's grasp of the material is assured."
1	"[Delpy has] created two original, quirky characters so obsessed with their differences that Paris is almost a distraction. I don't think I heard a single accordion in the whole film."
1	Sweet and discreet.
1	"2 Days in Paris may seem familiar, with its manic, walking-and-talking rhythms reminiscent of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in the 1970s. But you never know where it's going, which is one of the film's greatest pleasures."
1	"2 Days in Paris proves Delpy's got an authentic ear for humor in two languages, and she turns the dewy-eyed notion of Paris as a city for lovers firmly and affectionately on its tte."
1	"Bright and engaging a great deal of the time, but it ends up exhausted."
1	"Delpy does the old-[Woody] Allen thing a lot better than most, and does for Paris what Allen did for Manhattan, making it look newly romantic even to those who have lived there all their lives."
1	"Two Days in Paris is a romantic comedy, so it doesn't labour the disappointments of its lovers, merely stating them with a smile on its face."
1	"This slight, intermittently funny squib is a promising signpost."
1	"A playful, waspish remix of Richard Linklater's Before Sunset."
1	"A very likable, smart, offbeat film."
1	"The news that the 38-year-old gamine has not only directed Two Days in Paris but produced, written, edited, written the music for and starred in it might be slightly terrifying to all but Delpy obsessives. But it's great."
1	"A playful comedy, which shows off a wicked sense of humour and a real understanding of relationships."
1	"Partly a study of cross-national relationships and partly a homecoming comedy on Delpy's part, 'Two Days in Paris' neatly balances stabs at both America and the French."
1	"The last time I laughed so hard at a movie, it was Nigel Tufnel telling us his amplifier went to 11."
1	A movie that is as acutely painful as it is acutely funny.
1	"...an impressive, funny urban comedy of manners from a suitably distinctive voice that I hope we'll hear again soon."

1	"It's pure entertainment -- nothing too serious, nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility."
1	"The plot underlies even the most inexplicable scenes and eventually links even the most widely separated characters, but what makes the movie fun is the dialogue and the behavior."
1	This produces some rather nasty-funny surprises.
1	"There are too many characters, but some are a lot of fun. The tone shifts, from graphic murder to wig-flipping farce, are too extreme, but much of it works."
1	
1	"Funny, pathetic, sad, absurdist -- writer-director John Herzfeld plays it any number of ways, and makes them all work."
1	"A sleek, amusingly nasty screen debut by a film maker whose television credits include an Amy Fisher docudrama."
1	"Smoothly constructed, for such a busy piece of work, and Hatcher's ascent to stardom continues."
1	"To the director's credit, the actors all seem responsive to his touch, giving performances that are lively and flavorsome, if not deep or unlike anything each of them has done before."
0	"Herzfeld has a tolerable eye for filling a 'Scope frame but a tin ear when it comes to creating dialogue; these are all characters we've met before, and most even seem bored with themselves."
0	
1	"Like its predecessor, 2 Fast 2 Furious has a good-natured and realistic sense of its own junky weightlessness."
0	"2 Fast 2 Furious is among the most lethargic action movies I have ever seen: when Mr. Walker and Tyrese are not driving, it might as well be called 2 Slow 2 Tedious."
0	"2 Fast 2 Furious is frequently 2 fast 4 its own good, and only about 1/2 as furious as the last one. You do the math."
0	"Instead of the multi-everything family that races, parties and thieves together, Singleton unleashes spasms of sadism and innumerable leering shots of girls gone wild, albeit -- alas -- not behind the wheel."
0	"Splashy, shallow entertainment that delivers most of what its audience expects."
1	2Fast 2Furious has everything you want -- especially if what you want is 2Fast 2Furious.
0	"The Fast and the Furious was no classic, but it got you where it was going. 2 Fast 2 Furious shows some speed as well, but it's traveling down the road already taken."
0	"This John Singleton-directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyride,but it lacks the unassuming freshness of the economy-priced original."
0	Just another retread.
1	"How could we possibly reconnect with the primal urges of speed-demon street racers, without Vin's din? The answer, in two words: Vroom. Vroom."
0	"For all its technical prowess, pretty-boy looks and fetishistic appeal, 2 Fast is often laid low by a leaden script and a couple of glaring casting blunders."
1	"Nothing says summer film fun like explosions, guns and cartwheeling cars -- and that's all here."
1	"The pic is closer to the PlayStation experience of Gran Turismo than to a movie. This is not to say that it isn't fun, only to say that it is more about sensation than sense."
0	It's not every movie that would announce its shortcomings right in its title.
0	"Without Diesel, there's not much gas, at least not from the nonvehicular elements."
0	"Too much of 2 Fast 2 Furious plays like a colorful but inert timekiller that you might tolerate while dozing off in front of the TV, but only because you are too sleepy to reach for the remote control."
0	A contender for the worst movie of 2003.
1	"Even if you resist recklessness, these car catharses surge with noise, energy and adrenaline."
0	"The movie 2 Fast 2 Furious is not 2 good, but as a mental junk-food diversion, it's an occasionally stimulating jolt."
0	A mediocre film that could have been much worse.
0	A chaotic blur of a movie with only one discernible objective: to rev the idling engines of a mostly youthful audience.
1	Even more of a joy ride than the original.
1	"It's pure formula from start to finish, but that was obviously the goal from start to finish."
1	"It doesn't have a brain in its head, but it's made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious."
1	This is better -- though less culturally interesting -- than the movie that inspired it.
0	Energetic if empty sequel.
0	"For the DVD special edition, they might consider removing everything but the races and chases, including its Smokey and the Bandit scramble; fast-forwarding may be just too much effort."
0	"2 Fast 2 Furious is just 2 lame, 2 tame, and 2 much like a video game."
0	A kind of Miami Vice with many more carz and numberz where all the adjectives used 2 go.
1	A lark for anyone who's willing to check their brains at the concession stand for 100 minutes.
0	2 Fast 2 Furious is that rare film that's perfectly described by one of its co-stars' names: Ludacris.
0	2 Fast doesn't have the goods under the hood.
0	
0	"It's a terrible movie, stuck in plot idiocies and big, noisy set pieces like a tire mired in mud."
0	Director John Singleton once promised greatness with Boyz N the Hood. Here he's going through the paces with a story that was old by the second season of Miami Vice.
1	"Walker and Tyrese go for a no-frills style, giving the antiheroic protagonists solid emotional underpinnings before all the fancy driving gets started."
1	"The vehicular action in 2 Fast is profoundly low-tech, and engagingly brawny."
0	If you feel the need for speed in John Singleton's sluggish sequel to The Fast and the Furious then remember: just say no.
1	Charm makes up for ludicrous plotting in twist-heavy crime story.
0	"All you need for a movie are two guys and two guns. Unless that movie is 2 Guns, in which case you probably need a good deal more."
0	"Quickly degenerates into boilerplate Hollywood sound and fury, complete with a climactic Mexican standoff that revolves around a massive, burning pile of money. Irony, thou art lost."
1	"Kormakur shows he knows his way around an action movie better than most, keeping the pace quick, the banter lively and the old-school, mostly CGI-free thrills delivering right on schedule."
1	"Goosed along by a pulpy Elmore Leonard vibe, 2 Guns is essentially a B movie classed up by its two A-list stars."
0	"Kormkur could have removed some wackiness and made a gritty action movie or toned down the viciousness and played this off for comedy, but as it is, 2 Guns is neither fish nor fowl."
1	"In a summer when so many of the hype-heavy movies turned out to be big-budget bores, it's refreshing when a movie like 2 Guns achieves its admittedly modest ambitions."
0	"2 Guns slops over with instantly over-familiar ingredients like bantering criminal and/or crime-fighting buddies, a loathsome Mexican drug lord, and a femme vitale and femme fatale rolled into one comely dame."
0	"Though individual set pieces are well done, the film inevitably leaves an empty taste behind it once it's done."
0	"2 Guns loses its charm amid multiple incidents of torture and brutality, including animal cruelty ..."
0	Just go ahead and assume that everybody is trying to kill everybody and you'll be relatively clear.
0	"Thousands of rounds of ammo are spent in 2 Guns, a brutal, complicated and sporadically funny movie that still seems slight."
1	"Fast pacing and a high energy level can cover a lot of sins, and nowhere is that more evident than in 2 Guns."
1	"A slick, slippery thriller that taps into the anarchic playfulness that made the best American action flicks of the 1980s and '90s pop."
0	"With the combined heat of its stars, ""2 Guns"" should have had double impact, but Washington and Wahlberg are only doing this tango for cash."
0	"""2 Guns"" feels like it's all been done before, whether by John Woo, Michael Bay or any number of their CGI-happy clones."
0	"What's the old expression about putting lipstick on a pig? ""2 Guns,"" a busy and bullet-riddled new action movie, has some mighty fine lipstick, but it's still a porker."
0	Mr. Kormkur stages a succession of action sequences that are satisfying in their own right and might be better still if they were part of a coherent whole.
1	"It's a jumbled film with a lazy plot and poorly sketched action sequences, but the natural charm of its two stars, along with some colorful bit players, may put you in a forgiving mood."
1	"Pure charisma is sometimes the best special effect. That's what Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to 2 Guns, and after a season full of superhero duds, they deliver a crucial dose of cool."
0	"It's a complete mess, the spectacle of filmmakers blowing up their movie and everything in it, because they can't think of anything else to do."
1	"The Wahlberg-Washington express hits lots of comfortably familiar notes. And more than a few viciously uncomfortable ones, too."
1	"You could do far worse than watch Washington and Wahlberg bicker for a couple of hours, pausing every now and then to plug somebody."
1	"He has talent, this director: ""2 Guns"" isn't necessarily my thing (the jokey sadism is a drag), but Kormakur lays out an action sequence with a swiftness and a coherence missing from many other pictures."
1	"If we're being honest, Baltasar Kormkur's 2 Guns beats present-day Walter Hill at his own game."
0	I really meant to at least like 2 Guns. But I couldn't. The movie just didn't make the extra effort.
1	"This is what some summer movies should be like - clever in a stupid way, and stupid in a clever way."
1	"Gets us from point A to point B in a journey that, while predictable, is a breezily pleasant ride."
1	"If you're craving some irresponsible and amoral old-school August cinema, with no redeeming social value beyond the message that our government has gone insane and we're all totally screwed, you won't be let down."
0	"They're cute together, these two big stars, but the film around them, a sort of Tarantino lite, is desperately empty."
0	"On almost every level, 2 Guns is content to be as flavorless and forgettable as its title."
0	"Despite its A-list stars, ""2 Guns"" is a subpar B-movie shoot-'em-up that's lackadaisical, cynical and slow."
0	"For each amusing exchange, there's a gratuitous scene that dampens the proceedings. One of the worst involves the torture of chickens."
1	"For a movie with so many dead bodies, there's still something strangely lively about ""2 Guns"" - a film which is certainly too much, and often too confusing, but never, ever too dull."
1	The biggest guns this action flick brandishes are stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who have very different acting styles that work surprisingly well together.
0	It's essentially a buddy-cop romp with the usual assortment pack of graphic gruesomeness.
0	"An unremarkable, standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars."
0	"Banter, banter, banter. It's such fun being a tough guy and killing people."
1	Beyond ridiculous but always entertaining. Washington and Wahlberg are terrific.
1	"Clich is not a bad thing if it's done right. Like a good jazz improvisation, ""2 Guns"" leads to the same place but not the way you may expect."
0	"In this star vehicle for Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, the headlights are on full beam but the engine is struggling in second gear."
0	Not much firepower.
0	"A fairly indistinct Tex-Mex time-filler that soon gets lost amid memories of cooler, dustier, sweatier tear-ups."
1	"Wahlberg makes lines such as ""You know what you are? A misanthorp"" so insanely funny you laugh in the way you used to at Eddie Murphy."
1	"2 Guns is at Zen-like peace with the fact that it doesn't matter one bit, and I chucked and gasped through every not-mattering minute."
1	Wahlberg gives Washington levity; Washington gives Wahlberg resolve.
0	Like the Eighties never went away.
1	"That a movie this fleet and lean succumbs to action-blockbuster bloat in the home stretch is both disappointing and predictable, although the director deserves credit for keeping the climactic shootouts slick and spatially coherent."
1	Mark Wahlberg reunites with Contraband director Baltasar Kormakur for an action movie that's even more cynical and sadistic than its predecessor.
1	Washington and Wahlberg have a good time robbing banks and blowing up buildings and barreling through military security checkpoints and double-crossing people and shooting each other because none of it really means anything.
0	"False gravity weighs down 2 Jacks, a father-son drama less interested in exploring familial relations than in tut-tutting the millennials."
1	Rather thin but moderately entertaining.
1	It's a reasonably entertaining portrait of disreputable Tinseltown types that should at least provide some knowing chuckles for insiders.
0	"Unfortunately, these inconsistencies cause more confusion than the magic Rose is presumably going for."
1	"Playing these self-infatuated flimflammers, Danny and Jack Huston obviously know the drill. It's in their blood."
0	"Mostly, it makes you feel like the only sober person at a party you can't leave."
0	"Rose's apparent intent is to show how little of Hollywood's Golden Age magic is left today. In that, at least, he succeeds ."
0	"Based very loosely on an early short story by Leo Tolstoy, ""Two Jacks"" has a much less interesting second act ..."
0	Bernard Rose's fourth ultra-low-budget Tolstoy adaptation suffers from a slack narrative and abysmal dialogue.
0	A lot of fumbling follows as the film threatens to die of boredom... It's all a little too half-hearted.
1	The movie has none of the smugness of American Beauty: You could dream of living in a world like this.
0	"A story in which poor real folks are granted perspective only by brushing up against starlets, accidents, and villains of the tabloid press."
0	My mind kept wandering.
1	"Little is left to chance, and every detail contributes to a tightly schematic, microcosmic poetic concept."
1	"Well-acted and acutely observed, the sort of cerebral fare you can more typically find on HBO than in theaters these days."
1	"Mendelsohn's dialogue is, for the most part, as spare as poetry, and the three stories are woven together masterfully and acquire a gleaming aura that's almost pastoral."
1	"A blustery, bombastic, visually arresting account of the Battle of Thermopylae as channeled through the rabid imagination of graphic novelist Frank Miller."
1	Frank Miller's graphic novel about an ancient Greek battle comes to vivid life.
0	"Snyder's depiction of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, in which 300 Spartans fought off a much larger Persian army, is so over-the-top it's laughable -- so self-serious, it's hard to take seriously."
0	"Frankly, it's the slavish, frame-by-frame devotion to Miller's source material that's the problem. That explains both the risible screenplay and why the movie, for all its liberation from the real world, never takes full-winged flight."
1	300 is a movie blood-drunk on its own artful excess. Guys of all ages and sexes won't be able to resist it.
0	"Despite the fantastic visuals, action and sometimes rousing story, the needle flickers between grandiose and laughable -- in part because the film takes itself sooo relentlessly, slow-motion, music-swellin', see-you-in-hell seriously."
0	"The battle sequences are filled with grotesque spectacle: They start off entertainingly ferocious, then grow numbing with stylized spraying blood and severed heads."
1	"This is dazzle for the head, not the heart."
1	"300 may not offer masterful storytelling in a conventional sense, but it's hard to beat as a spectacle and that makes it worthwhile viewing for all but the most squeamish of potential audience members."
0	"300, even with its impressive vistas of computer-generated soldiers, is just a throwaway epic."
1	"300 is about as subtle as a spear through the head. But it's also shamelessly entertaining, and not a bad way to make time move a little faster."
0	300 is about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid.
0	"It also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band, or so I choose to think of us, who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity."
0	"A mythic ode to righteous bellicosity. In at least one way, the film is true to the ethos of ancient Greece: It conflates moral excellence and physical beauty (which, in this movie, means being young, white, male, and fresh from the gyms of Brentwood)."
0	"300 is one breathtaking digi-tableau after another. But the dialogue is a joke, the performances have more to do with bodybuilding than character, and the lesson that the film imparts isn't anything to do with courage and military skill."
0	"Unless you like human shish kabob, don't spring forward. Fall back."
0	"Snyder's 300 certainly has its share of the latest toys, but they make for a better coming-attractions trailer than a full-length theatrical film."
0	Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought -- it's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych. The dissonance between the film's heroic ambitions and its grindingly coarse treatment is rather amusing.
1	"It is undeniably exciting and awe-inspiring; but it also lacks a sense of tactile warmth, a crucial core of reality."
0	"There's a stale, synthetic airlessness about the movie. Imagine a large cast trapped in a series of spectacular screensavers. It could be ancient Greece. It could be somebody's hard drive."
1	"In creating the ultimate movie for sword-and-sandal blood-spatter fetishists, director Zack Snyder scores on the spectacle side -- 300 looks amazing -- but his mechanical story line and over-the-top melodramatics don't support the action."
0	"The disconnect between the human actors and the digital backgrounds is more pronounced here... Because classic Hollywood cinema is so rich with epic images of antiquity, this can't help but seem chintzy."
0	"It's kind of a ghastly hoot, and while I suppose it does no harm, it also contributes nothing. It's a guilty unpleasantness."
0	The movie should've been called Ode to a Grecian Ab.
1	300 is at its best when it settles for purely visceral thrills.
1	"A full-blooded, testosterone-spiked shot glass that you down in one ferocious sitting."
1	"Put bluntly, the movie's just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing. And 'silly' is invoked here, more or less, with affection."
1	Call 300 the New Age sword-and-sandal epic -- a Hercules movie for the computer age.
0	"If the movie's neocon message is as thin as a politician's excuse, that's to be expected. But what's surprising here is that the sights are just as meagre."
0	"History is inconveniently complex. And so we get Frank Miller's version, in which everything is simplified to the point of porridge."
0	"Keeping in mind Slate's Mickey Kaus' Hitler Rule -- never compare anything to Hitler -- it isn't a stretch to imagine Adolf's boys at a 300 screening, heil-fiving each other throughout and then lining up to see it again."
1	"Watching 300, there's the arresting sense of eavesdropping on another time."
1	It's impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault.
1	"It's most definitely a Spartan movie, yet it's really all about wretched excess."
1	Does the film stay faithful to the Miller and Varley's vision? Indeed it does -- to a kunch!
1	"For once, the Larry King quote machines who supply the advance blurbs to the studio for their marketing campaigns will be correct."
1	"Snyder gives his movie the encompassing look and feel of a graphic novel. Perhaps because he shot the actors in front of digitally concocted backgrounds, Snyder is able to sustain an otherworldly quality that perfectly suits the movie's lurid material."
0	[Gerard Butler's character] charisma is elusive. He vigorously enunciates like a summer stock player doing Shakespeare. But the writing's overblown. And locating the requisite sorrow in this tale of heroism is an afterthought for Snyder and co.
1	"It is excessively, cheerfully violent -- and it is gorgeous to behold. It looks like the world's most sophisticated and expensive video game, and I mean that in a good way."
0	"Part of the fascination of the Thermopylae story is that it really happened, and it helped define real heroism. There's nothing remotely like reality to be had in this film."
0	"As to this pumped-up spectacle's other aims, it's anybody's guess: selling gladiatorial chest-beating as beefcake erotica? Combining a movie and its own video-game spin-off into one package? Being both a dessert topping and a floor wax?"
0	The kids just want to have fun. Many of them will. But what does that say about another Greek contribution -- Western civilization?

1	3000 Miles to Graceland revs up into oddly entertaining ride.
0	A film that takes a shot at redefining shameless for a new generation.
0	3000 Miles to Graceland has the schizophrenic look and feel of something that has been stamped 'Return to Sender' on more than one occasion.

0	One wannabe blockbuster that deserves to be lonesome tonight.
0	"A bloody, tedious mess."
0	"Too much of the film is pure filler, visuals manipulated for onanistic purposes."

1	"The mere existence of 300: Rise of an Empire is worthy of note, especially the inventive means by which the story has been advanced."
0	The flaccid execution of this promiscuous-New Yorkers circle jerk is more worthy of the clap than a round of applause.
0	It is absolutely terrible.
0	"Under the circumstances, even first-rate New York stage actors like Thomas Sadoski and Justin Kirk seem uncertain and tentative."
0	"In ""30 Beats,"" the conversational foreplay is hopelessly flaccid."

0	"It means to be an interconnected story, in which one coupling leads to another in increasingly ridiculous fashion, until you're not only no longer interested, you're grinding your teeth, hoping it will end."
0	"Where the original play ""La Ronde"" was a social satire about the transmission of venereal disease, ""30 Beats"" is a sickly stepchild."
0	The jazz-scored pic relies heavily on quirkiness to round out shaky characterizations and inject interest into otherwise forgettable pairings.
0	This umpteenth variation on Schnitzler's classic play La Ronde fails to arouse.
0	The movie's just not very scary.
0	You can only see so many snarling hissy fits by vampires with perpetually bloody chins before they start looking less like monsters and more like ill-tempered circus clowns whose makeup is running.
0	"30 Days of Night is relentless, but it's also relentlessly one-note."
1	30 Days hangs on a pretty cool conceit.
1	"This is a full-on, non-stop horror film. You're either on the bus or off the bus. But if you are on, you're hanging on with both hands and your hair flying back for the better part of the movie."
0	The film moves from truly creepy to truly inane.
0	"Despite the clever twist of fighting vampires with an ultraviolet lamp (good thing grandma grew pot), this horror-flick fondue settles into an extended cat-and-mouse sequence dotted with the occasional dollop of gore."
0	"The script is simple stuff, simpler than the graphic novel, which at least managed to devote a page or two to the vampires' back story."
1	Result is a mixed bag but has a catchy premise and quite enough splatter to satisfy gorehounds.
1	30 Days of Night is the kind of gruesome but entertaining survival guide you pray you never have to follow: how to stop vampires killing you during the darkest days of Alaskan winter.
1	30 Days of Night manages to do for the vampire genre what 28 Days Later did for the zombie flick: give age-old monsters a modern-day makeover.
0	"It's clear the film script has gone through the standard Hollywood death-of-a-thousand-rewrites wringer to emerge as shadow of its former self, drained of much of its creative synergy."
1	"Fleshing out their minimalist story in a way that won't cause the blood to drain from fans' faces, it's one of the better recent efforts as both a comic adaptation and a fright flick."
1	"30 Days of Night is the well-paced and entertaining horror debut of Hard Candy director David Slade, who captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles' comic book series on the big screen."
1	A truly terrifying hell-ride through darkness for grownups.
1	Director David Slade takes the film adaptation halfway home by getting the look exactly right.
0	"Whatever power the original comic had, this film adaptation lost it in translation."
0	"You could make a horror film with shocking story developments and creepy twists. Or, you could just have monsters with pointy teeth jump into the frame while making loud noises. For the latter, check out the vampire flick 30 Days of Night."
0	"The increasingly ridiculous behavior of some of the other humans turn the film laughable by interrupting its brutality with banality. And when it comes to vampires, brutal is always better."
0	"An anemic adaptation of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's creepy comic series, 30 Days of Night is lighter on horror than it is on inadvertent humor."
1	"Even as stage blood flows like water, this wicked-mean vampire thriller pushes ahead with effective characters, a fantastic visual schema and a terrifying plot."
1	"Like most kiddies games, this one starts out fun and then gets tired. Inevitably, that's when Slade tries to revive our interest by upping the gore quotient."
1	"Even when it resorts to the hoariest clichs, 30 Days of Night still chills."
0	"I have pretty much reached my quota for vampire movies, but I shouldn't hold that against this one. If you haven't seen too many, you might like it."
1	"30 Days is a proficient, atmospheric fangfest that does nothing you haven't seen before but still does it passably well."
1	"The humans are a bore, but the vampires light up this Night."
0	"The performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesn(TM)t rise nearly fast enough."
1	"If this is the kind of movie you're looking for, it delivers."
0	"It has a fairly original premise and some blood-curdling moments, but it's also predictable, repetitive and vile."
0	A terrific horror premise goes begging in the garbled Halloween offering 30 Days of Night.
0	"Director David Slade is clearly of the opinion that more is more, so there is lots of blood, lots of gore, and lots of vampires in black coats standing around as if auditioning for a remake of the Michael Jackson Thriller video."
0	"The problem is structural. After the invasion, we're marooned with the dull survivors."
1	"30 Days Of Night strikes out a nerve-jangling, bloodily unpredictable route to a truly stunning ending that's well worth the wait."
0	"A frustrating mix of imaginative design, erratic plotting and underwritten characters."
1	"A real baying-at-the-moon gorefest, unusual both for its savagery and for a half-decent performance from Hartnett."
0	"Adapted from the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, 30 Days of Night is so dead serious you may feel the frequent urge to poke it in the ribs."
0	30 Days of Night has a striking comic-book aesthetic and macabre sense of fun - if your sense of fun includes watching a vampire turned into pt in the gnashing metal jaws of a rubbish processor.
0	Feels derivative of 28 Days Later.

0	"Clocking in at a mercifully short 83 minutes, pic spares us the endless ad-libbing, but isn't nearly as tight as its title implies."
0	"Even if the film had been 30 minutes or less, this comedy would still be too long."
1	"It's punchy, nasty, laugh-out-loud-funny stuff that doesn't flag or wear out its welcome."
0	"Like his latest, Fleischer's Zombieland borrowed plenty of genre tropes, but paid them back with a self-aware wink. 30 Minutes or Less just takes the money and runs."
1	"30 Minutes or Less is slight and not exactly memorable, but it moves quickly and has some surprising twists and top-notch performances all around. Not bad for a disposable late-summer comedy."
1	"[A] zany, irreverent comedy."
0	"The film wallows in such abject stupidity for big chunks of time that the talents of such actors as Jesse Eisenberg, Aziz Ansari, Danny McBride and Nick Swardson are largely wasted."
1	"30 Minutes shouldn't work. But it does. A stoner movie without the spliff smoke, it's proudly, sexually lewd with no cushion of boyish sweetness."
1	It's hard to hate a movie that affectionately references the oeuvre of Kathryn Bigelow (both The Hurt Locker and Point Break!) and uses a whiny Third Eye Blind ballad as an acidic punch line.
0	Either it goes for a particular tone and doesn't achieve it. Or it does achieve a tone that's not really worth striving for.
0	30 Minutes wallows in stupidity without making the bromance bonds believable.
0	"At a mere 83 minutes, 30 Minutes or Less might seem able to deliver on the promise of its zippy title. Instead, this slackers-go-gangsta comedy demonstrates that less than 90 minutes can be a very long time."
0	"The movie claims to be only 83 minutes long, but it's the longest 83 minutes to come along in quite awhile."
0	"The only consistent laughs come from Michael Pea's eccentric hired killer, the movie's one character who seems like someone we haven't seen a million times before."
0	"Sometimes a rude and crude comedy is simply scraping the bottom of the barrel, despite the efforts of a talent like Mr. Eisenberg and of second bananas like Mr. Ansari and Mr. Swardson."
1	30 Minutes or Less is all about the zigzagging rush of the ride.
1	"A darkly comic underachiever that manages to charm almost in spite of itself, Ruben Fleischer's ""30 Minutes or Less"" is probably best watched as it was made: without much evident effort."
0	"It has a miserable start - well, it has a miserable middle, too."
1	The movie ends up being just sharp enough at its peaks to be frustrating in its valleys. But the laughs are there.
0	"Something similar actually happened once, but the result wasn't funny. Neither is ""30 Minutes or Less,"" although it smirks like it thinks so."
0	"I had decent hopes for this high-concept, low-brow comedy; those hopes were quickly dashed."
0	"I ran out of patience, even by August standards, way before the movie was over."
0	"A film that climaxes with a trade-off in a junkyard has a rich appreciation for the clichs of the action-comedy genre, but 30 Minutes Or Less is ultimately so muddled and slight that's it's hard to ascertain what the filmmakers were thinking."
0	If only it were 30 minutes or less.
0	"Moral of the story: If you occupy the demographic that this film is aimed at, Hollywood doesn't have a very high opinion of you."
0	"None of this crackles with the kind of breezy, madcap hilarity that it should; it's actually rather tortured and convoluted."
1	"The dark, biting comedy often strays into territory that can be categorized as politically incorrect, but the result is funny, engaging, and at times a little disconcerting."
1	"The movie belongs to Ansari, who steals nearly every scene he is in with his jangly, nervous intensity."
0	"This is disappointing news, given that the director of this sputter-rev-sputter ride is Ruben Fleischer??and that nattering Jesse Eisenberg stars."
1	"It's a bit like the Three Stooges on crack -- nutty, loud, profane and full of laughs. It won't change your life and it might hurt your ears, but it should keep you smiling."
1	"In a year lousy with badly written movies filled with phallic fixations, it's a relief to watch one that is happy to be rude good fun without excessive raunch."
0	"From the premise to the performances, everything and everybody just seems to be trying way too hard."
0	One of the great disappointments of my cinematic year so far.
0	The film's running time and sudden ending suggest a desperate last-minute edit to cut anything that wasn't working. They stopped too soon.
0	"For a soul-sucking 83 minutes, you're trapped inside the film's tiny, ugly mind."
1	"""30 Minutes or Less"" may be tasteless, moronic and lacking in any redeeming social value whatsoever. But for me, at least, it was gut-bustingly funny -- perhaps this waning summer season's ultimate guilty pleasure."
0	"Beholding Eisenberg in Fleischer's relentlessly vulgar and un-funny ""30 Minutes or Less"" is akin to watching a ring-tested champion punch far below his weight. What a comedown."
0	Probably has the approximate cultural staying power of its title.
0	"30 Minutes or Less is so shallow, self-satisfied, and downright repulsive that I hesitate to discuss it at all. It has none of the qualities of director Fleischer's debut feature, Zombieland, and it's a long way from Eisenberg's..."
0	It never reconciles the meticulous intelligence needed to build the weaponry and the monstrous stupidity needed to use it.
1	"It's funny, clever and pacy to a fault, and the script more than satisfies its quota of decent zings."
1	"It's entirely ridiculous, but it gallops cheerfully along; everything is carried off with flair and ingenuity."
0	"It all goes horribly wrong, with the characters and the audience united in anguish."
0	"Crude, charmless and knuckleheaded."
0	"Puerile, irritating and insultingly phallocentric."
0	30 Minutes or Less has one of those screenplays that looks goodish on paper but is only a bit above average.
0	"The film contains a remarkable level of violence, yet never establishes a tone that would make it seem funny or truly shocking; the jokes flounder in an air of half-hearted spite."
1	"A light, engaging, well-carpentered film, with a quick wit and a sense of character just deep enough to lend some weight to the laugh lines."
1	"Middleton ... has assembled a clique of familiar, broadly drawn characters, but her film manages to rise above sitcom status, thanks to their sassy repartee."
0	Too many exchanges are sitcom-smooth.
0	"It's a fanboy's highlight reel of homages, without any of the credibility or context that made most of the films [Zombie is] inspired by so fine."
1	"A cinematic Jgerbomb: definitely not good for you, but gets the job done."
1	"The Rob Zombie brand promises hard-core horror and scuzzy atmosphere, and ""31"" delivers just that. Even on autopilot, Zombie makes movies that hit hard and leave a stain."
0	A grindhouse slog of unrelenting bad taste.
0	"Rob Zombie can do better than 31. For proof, just watch any other Rob Zombie movie."
0	"Isn't as unwatchable as other similar movies, but it's still pretty deplorable and offensive."
0	31 may well satisfy the witching-hour masses. But will it get under anyone's skin? Dream on.
1	"Zombie may not be working outside of his comfort zone, but 31 is one of his most impressive films to date."
1	"Charging boldly into battle, 31 North 62 East manages to conquer its low-budget shortcomings, emerging bruised, battered but ultimately triumphant."
0	"The storyline is hackneyed and nonsensical, as if Loraine had plucked clichs from episodes of The Professionals and strung them together."
0	[The] fiendish scheme crumbles under an onslaught of machine-tooled plot twists and a barrage of expository dialogue.
0	"Writer-director Tristan Loraine has grand schemes in the pipeline, but this absurd stab at sub-Tom-Clancy conspiracy thrills won't help his credentials. When Craig Fairbrass is your closest thing to a badge of quality, be afraid."
0	"A low-budget British ""thriller"" that is comfortably the worst film I can remember seeing: threadbare plot, clunking dialogue, brain-dead conspiracy theorising, and a gallery of embarrassing racial stereotypes. Avoid at all costs."
1	"Reinforced by a strong central premise, James Mangold's remake walks a fine line in retaining many of the original's qualities while smartly shaking things up a bit."
1	James Mangold's expanded take on 3:10 to Yuma makes for a largely compelling ride on the strength of a powerful cast led by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.
1	"James Mangold's movies include Cop Land (1997), Girl, Interrupted (1999), and Walk the Line (2005), and this is by far his most sustained and evocative work."
1	A sturdy and enjoyable remake of the 1957 minor classic.
1	"It's a wonderful surprise to discover that this new version, starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale and directed by James Mangold, not only remains true to its roots but expands on them in ways that are thrilling and thoroughly entertaining."
1	"Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma isn't as startling a resurrection job as his Johnny Cash biopic, but it does send a saddlebag full of western tropes skittering into the 21st century."
0	"Decent-enough entertainment, though it's hardly going to breathe new life to a genre whose demise has been reported for at least 30 years."
1	"Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are two of the finest actors of their generation, and their talents are put to great use."
1	"Watching a movie like this, I can't help but wish that the Western would come back into favor again. We can use more productions like this."
1	The performances of Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bale alone are worth the price of admission.
1	"Maybe this redo didn't need so many bells and whistles, but Mangold brings it home."
0	"The story is no bigger in the new version, which goes on for 117 minutes. And it's certainly not better."
1	"May not shake all the cowbells off the genre, but it kicks up plenty of dust."
1	Yields performances as elemental as the landscape while it questions a culture more concerned with money than human life.
1	"What Alfred Hitchcock once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns: The stronger the bad guy, the better the film. By that measure, 3:10 to Yuma is excellent."
0	"A period-perfect, witty, well-played and exciting Western is all but ruined in the final minutes by someone the screenwriters, a star who insisted on image-flattering changes, a director feeling his Walk the Line oats."
0	"Those who have a deeper abiding love for the western genre than I, may love the new Yuma. I liked a good deal of it -- just enough to be frustrated by the clutter."
1	Moves like a barn on fire.
0	The movie feels like an uneasy combination of new and old western stylings.
1	3:10 to Yuma is a drama well worth the journey.
1	"James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma, an old-school Western updated for modern mores and tastes, pays due homage to its 1957 predecessor."
1	"When a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival."
1	"[Director] Mangold succeeds on his own terms, largely because the actors he's working with here, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, so comfortably inhabit the movie, and the genre that cradles it."
1	"You don't need to be a fan of that near-extinct genre to enjoy the movie -- sold more as a faceoff between Alpha males Russell ""Gladiator"" Crowe and Christian ""Batman"" Bale -- but it may turn you into one."
1	This Yuma is Shane with a train.
1	In 3:10 to Yuma director James Mangold has made himself a grand Western.
1	An extremely well-acted and well-directed remake of a 1957 oater based on a short story by the then-obscure Elmore Leonard.
1	"... gritty, hugely entertaining."
1	"The heart-stopping, breathtaking journey of 3:10 to Yuma reminds us just how exciting a good, old-fashioned movie can be."
1	"[Director] Mangold has brought welcome intensity to the project, giving 3:10 to Yuma a visceral, immediate quality that makes it realistic and mythic all at the same time."
1	"The best Western since Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma is both cathartic and intelligent. While a wildly eventful action-adventure and outlaw shoot-'em-up, it's also a vibrant story of heroism, villainy and hard-earned redemption."
1	"It's got old-timey atmosphere with just enough new-age empathy to work. Throw in plenty of gun fighting and two fine actors circling one another with glee, and you've got one hot pistol of a movie."
1	"It remains, underneath all the decoration and heavy artillery, a good yarn."
0	The tale never quite resonates beyond the screen.
1	3:10 to Yuma manages to incorporate the rhythms of a contemporary action movie while maintaining a healthy respect for the tenets of the genre. That makes it a train well worth catching.
1	James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of pointless violence.
1	Director James Mangold draws good performances from both leads as they wrestle with the predatory power structure of the old west.
1	"Lean, almost absurdly satisfying."
1	"The lean, cerebral swagger of the 1957 western 3:10 to Yuma is stretched out and punched up with more characters, gun-shooting and horse-riding in an entertaining remake directed by James Mangold."
1	"Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are the main reasons to see 3:10 to Yuma, a serviceable addition to the current western revival."
1	"Crowe and Bale are a great study in contrasts, yet the two characters develop a grudging respect for each other that enriches the murky morality play that makes up the last half hour."
1	The editing is tense and there's mucho splatter but the climax is unforgivable for reasons I can't spell out -- and owes something to a recent picture I can't name.
1	"At the helm of this remake, James Mangold initially risks stalling the plot with too much backstory, but then it's edge-of-your-seat action all the way."
1	"James Mangold's expert and entertaining 3:10 to Yuma demonstrates both the Western's age-old appeal, and the problems it presents to a contemporary filmmaker."
1	A well-made movie that isn't as simply expressed as its predecessor and so loses some of its mythic quality; the more you complicate westerns the less effective they often become.
1	"A shame that it ends on this one false note, but up to that point 3.10 To Yuma fairly races along."
1	"New Zealand's Russell Crowe and Britain's Christian Bale, donning the hats and accents to play outlaw and escort with grizzled assurance."
1	"A terrific turn by Peter Fonda, as a leathery bounty hunter hell-bent on retribution, is a bonus in a film far livelier than anyone had a right to expect."
1	"Despite a faintly anti-climactic ending, there's plenty of entertainment in this robust, old-fashioned western tale."
1	"A remake of a 1957 movie starring Glenn Ford, Yuma's pacing may owe something to the contemporary action movie, but the themes are age-old: redemption, morality and the lure of the lawless wilderness and of the killers who call it home."
1	"They don't make them like that anymore. But, hang on, they just did!"
1	"The two leads' sparking byplay, Crowe's addled cockiness versus Bale's nervy grit, would grace any surroundings, but it's a pleasure to revisit the frontier in a drama which feels far more vital than mere nostalgic homage."
1	"Mangold delivers a taut modern take on a lesser classic, preserving the High Noon themes about doing the right thing against all odds, and injecting a more modern pacing and urgency without going overboard."
1	Mangold's film is more than sufficiently subtexty and cynical for our modern sensibilities while simultaneously embracing Mangold's obvious pleasure in the Westerns' time-honored swinging saloon doors and stern masculine traditions.
1	The film is a creditable remake - no better than the original but different enough to stand on its considerable merits.
1	"Nothing terribly original happens in this remake of a 1957 semi-classic that starred Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, but everything happens smoothly and with grace."
0	The script's programmatic feel-goodery smooths out everything strange and noteworthy about Dean and Mei Mei's relationship into an unmemorable and unconvincing blandness.
0	"Just when you think it can't get any more sentimental or tack on any more plot detours, the film attempts a clumsy cultural dtente as the Chinese children's choir sings ""Waltzing Matilda."""
1	"It's all in the name of heartstring tugging, and the film, directed by Pauline Chan (""Little White Lies""), does that pretty well."
0	"There's no explaining the presence of Guy Pearce in Pauline Chan's sappy, atonal family drama. But it's easy enough to understand why he looks so uncomfortable throughout."
0	"A clunky hybrid-half feel-good weepie, half preposterous thriller-that functions primarily as an elaborate travel brochure ..."
0	"Innocence meets experience, unconvincingly, in the strained redemption drama ""33 Postcards."""
0	"Were it not for the staccato bursts of violence, this Chinese-Australian co-production about how an adorable orphan brings love into the life of a hardened convict would feel like a film from Hayley Mills' heyday."
0	"What's left is a sequence of downbeat sex skits, slotted together with all the finesse of an Ikea cabinet."
1	360 is not a film to love easily.
1	"This is the filmic equivalent of a relay race. Some legs work very well but, during others, Meirelles and his team risk dropping the baton altogether."
0	"With a multilingual cast of mostly unfamiliar faces, + a few stars, 360 feels too abstract, orchestrating break-ups and hook-ups in a passionless vacuum."
1	La Ronde 2011-style is simply a game and its makers expert gamesmen. The film is never less than intriguing. But the artifice shows all too clearly.
0	"A better title: A Few Famous and Not-So-Famous Actors Bump into Each Other and Don't Do or Say Much of Consequence. Wordy, yes, but accurate."
0	"Any lingering goodwill is sapped in the final minutes when a character earnestly opines, ""We have come full circle."" Talk about a cycle that needs breaking."
0	"There are fleeting moments, but Morgan's narrative promiscuity leaves 360 feeling only spread out and empty."
1	"360 has a circular structure that's deftly pleasing, though the human drama is just facile enough to make it seem, in the end, a little too much like connect the dots played with people."
0	"I hope Peter Morgan doesn't give up writing, and I do hope Meirelles gives up trying to be Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu."
0	"We hopscotch from person to person, continent to continent, grievance to grievance until things come thuddingly full circle (thus, the title)."
0	"360 throws in enough cold weather, meaningful stares and cursory explorations of globalism to fool easily-impressed audiences into thinking they've seen something important, but there's nothing new or resonant going on here."
0	"With its international collection of mostly two-dimensional characters and its barely developed ideas on adultery, capitalism, addiction and sex, ""360"" is an over-plotted and dreary farrago."
0	"Mr. Morgan has written some good movies, notably ""The Queen,"" and Mr. Meirelles has won fans for neo-exploitation titles like ""City of God."" There's no way to know what went wrong with ""360"" and whether it was this uninvolving and shallow from the start."
0	"The movie makes for joyless viewing, big stars and all."
0	A mistake from beginning to end.
0	"360 has the pedigree, cast, and scope of a weighty film, but nothing much to say."
0	"Like the fork that usually comes with your airplane meal, 360 is plastic."
0	One thing is remarkable here: the amount of high-powered talent assembled to document the obvious.
0	"""360"" gives us much in the way of international anguish, frustrated coupling and longing stares, but there's very little plausibility or genuine emotion in its egregiously contrived story of ardor gone amiss."
0	"'360' is classy but utterly amorphous, and that seemingly benign title gives far too much away."
0	"Much like its own characters, it dithers too much - and it dares too little."
0	"If someone suggests seeing this, do a 180 - and run."
0	Morgan's dramatis personae connect only in the way a house's wiring connects after a visit by a duff electrician.
0	"There's one Anthony Hopkins monologue to remember, but that only highlights everything the rest of the film so sorely lacks."
0	"If you're hoping for an intelligent night out or any of the usual services, 360 demands a brisk refund."
0	360 is a classic example of how you can't always judge a movie by its credits.
0	"Though the cinematography looks sleek, with shots through windows and in mirrors, split screens and city lights that blur and sharpen, the stories equate to a tangled mess."
0	"The film's generic, meaningless title is a sign of the dullness to come."
0	"There's one Anthony Hopkins monologue to remember, but that only highlights everything the rest of the film so sorely lacks."
0	"Eventually, though, the film loses confidence in itself, overloading its last third with needless family-secret twists and one especially unnecessary travelogue denouement."
1	A refreshingly unbiased look at a real heroine.
1	"""37 Seconds"" is deceptively delicate and quietly tough. Not unlike its protagonist."
1	"This isn't the anodyne, awards-baiting film about disability that viewers might be used to; instead, Hikari's feature debut is sensitive and empathetic, showing a young woman who is more than just her cerebral palsy."
1	"It's a rare film that understands disability as a complex part of its character's understanding of themselves and the world around them, rather than a categorization to be swiftly demonized or fetishize."
0	"There's little new: the intimidation techniques (pet abduction, home invasion) feel clichd and the film trundles towards an unenlightening conclusion."
1	It all works - just.
0	Cole's film serves as a reminder to go back and watch the superior works it lifts from.
0	"The aim is to give us the stalker's view and, most of the time, it works."
1	The visuals in Randall Cole's paranoia chiller 388 Arletta Avenue evoke Michael Haneke's Cach and Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window in the way they make domesticity seem terrifying.
1	388 Arletta Avenue manages to use the terrorized-couple genre to provide a timely commentary on supposedly safe homes and distant wars.
0	Willing suspension of disbelief -- or suppression of giggles -- is required.
1	"A playfully pieced-together, beautifully shot, and secretly ridiculous drama about a triangular relationship among blas Berliners."
0	You can't shake the feeling that 3 exists primarily to justify a shot of three figures impeccably posed together on a mattress.
1	"...Tom Tykwer's provocative and ferociously intelligent 3, a movie no Hollywood studio would ever green-light but which is nonetheless one of this year's best films so far."
1	"A sensuous intellectual romp whose strong casting makes it involving, even when sentimentality creeps into the story or ideas present themselves in boldface."
1	"The lyrical conclusion, set to the surging, diaphanous music of Debussy, gives ""3"" a surprisingly sweet aftertaste."
1	"[Showcases] a restless, ambitious talent who invariably puts an idiosyncratic stamp on his material, no matter how ordinary it is at the core."
0	"Rois has moments of desperate urgency and depth, but Twyker's love of parallels is finally done in by artsy shots of the threesome au naturel against stark white backdrops."
0	Tykwer exhibits a fondness for split screens and other eye candy but no interest in formalities like character and plot development.
0	"Despite its fascinating and humorous moments, one can't help but be frustrated when at times it switches away to spiritual pretentiousness."
1	"It's a funny, fearless, suspenseful sex comedy that, in drawing on science and philosophy and art and death, risks accusations of pretentiousness."
0	"Tykwer can't seem to turn Hanna, Simon and Adam into real people. They feel like pawns in the service of a more cerebral diversion than the game of life."
1	"Tykwer's script is structured so that the audience knows more about the characters' connections than they do. As each faces a midlife crisis/turning point, fate sometimes appears to be calling the shots."
0	"The film is successful in an absorbing sort of way, but underwhelming."
1	"There's no denying that writer-director Jordan Roberts earns a good number of laughs, and even some extended guffaws, with his crass romance about sex, lies and digital video."
1	"Though riddled with credibility-straining coincidences and over-the-top humiliation, Jordan Roberts' Frankie Go Boom plays out with more charm than desperation."
0	"No matter how many jokes about impotence, vomiting pigs, deviant movie stars and underground adult-entertainment you shove into a gross-out flick, there are few things worse than strained outrageousness."
0	"Less inept than its worst-of-the-year title suggests, 3, 2, 1 . . . Frankie Go Boom nonetheless proves too ramshackle and aimless to ever achieve true absurdity."
0	A noisy stab at wacky wrongness that starts with reasonably plump possibility as a dispatch from the frontlines of viral video embarrassment hell.
1	A vibrantly vulgar comedy that never hangs around to admire its own cleverness.
0	"Tragically unfunny, Frankie is occasionally elevated by some of its gifted and game cast, but the film's nasty, comedically incoherent script limits its potential."
1	"Both actors somehow stay grounded despite all the shenanigans. Hunnam, in particular, is quite adept at playing against his movie-star looks."
0	"Just like that cumbersome ""3, 2, 1 ..."" of the title, Roberts adds too many elements to nearly every scene of this insanely frenetic comedy."
0	"The image of [Perlman] in makeup and a wig, painting his toenails, is a terribly easy joke, but it's the best one this otherwise abrasive comedy can manage."
0	A sub-Apatovian farce that tries way too hard ...
1	"Though deliciously rude and crude, '3, 2, 1 ... Frankie Go Boom' possesses a surprisingly sweet heart."
1	"It's hard to laugh, but the overall joke of placing an explosive man in a society known for harmony is darkly fascinating."
1	"Something is rotten in the state of Japan, and the Renaissance man who goes by the name Takeshi Kitano doesn't mind saying so."
1	The funniest film to date from a key '90s film-maker.
1	"[Takeshi Kitano is] scary, hilarious and, in a strange way, touching."
1	"The allegory in this 1990 yakuza thriller eludes me, but writer-director Takeshi Kitano's handling of tones, which range from the grimly depressive to the irreverently hilarious, is amazing."
1	"It's a stranger and better film than Violent Cop, as well as an indication of even better things to come."
0	"A scattershot McG action/comedy/romance/drama, the closest our era has to the audience-pleasing ambitions of William Wyler, if Wyler had first gotten drunk on Bud Light Lime."
0	3 Days To Kill is one Liam Neeson shy of a Liam Neeson vehicle.
0	"Long before Kevin Costner is demanding pasta sauce info at gunpoint from a terrified Italian hostage in 3 Days to Kill, it's obvious no one is following any kind of coherent recipe for this movie."
0	"The result is a little like baby bear's porridge, neither all bad nor all good, though not quite right yet either."
0	"The idea seems to have been to explore how little sense a movie could make, and how little that could matter, and also to allow Mr. Costner to indulge in some good-natured sadism and a bit of middle-aged sentimentality."
0	"[A] bloated, queasy, quasi-comical extravaganza."
0	"""3 Days,"" though not without pleasures, doesn't seem to know what it is; it's three not-quite-good-enough movies, all in one."
0	"Contrived and manic, Days can't decide whether it's a thriller, comedy or feel-good family film."
0	"It's like a bad Liam Neeson actioner crossed with a worse American sitcom, and it's a mess."
0	"Like Ethan, ""3 Days to Kill"" has a job to do, but it prefers to shoot first and ask questions later."
0	"Every so often a bad movie will become so mind-bogglingly, existentially bad that it turns perversely good. Unfortunately, ""3 Days to Kill"" isn't that bad."
1	Costner effortlessly blends deadpan comic flair with action movie heroics in this preposterous but entertaining genre mashup.
0	Any possibility of sleeper-hit status has been fatally compromised by watered-down fight scenes and misguided family man dramatics.
0	"Besson provided the story and co-wrote the screenplay for a film directed by McG, who does his usual McGhastly job with action and is McGruesome when it comes to comedy."
0	Costner seems bored by most of the convoluted goings-on.
0	"A movie primarily distinctive as a jacob's ladder of choices that make less and less sense, McG's latest is an ambitious disaster that tries to be two things at once - an action movie and a domestic comedy - but does neither well."
0	"Points for effort all the way around, and welcome back, Costner. Let's hope things get better from here."
0	"To the degree that the film works, it's because Costner plays the straight man."
0	"A comic-tragic-sentimental genre hodgepodge that wants to make you feel all the feelings amid all that action spectacle. It doesn't entirely deliver, but at times you can't help but admire its strangeness."
1	"Just sit back and enjoy. ""3 Days to Kill"" is big dumb fun anchored by a good actor's refusal to take himself too seriously."
1	"It's the modern dilemma: how to balance work with family, get the job done, and still have time to share a meal with the wife and kid."
0	"Costner deserves better, and the fact that he doesn't phone it in here indicates that he thinks maybe so do you."
0	"The movie never finds a way to blend the emotional and the rat-a-tat-tat into one seamless package the way that Besson did in his one and only good movie, The Professional."
0	"How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn't have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad?"
1	Pure trash but it's entertaining as hell.
0	"Every gag is premised on the fact that Renner allows his work and personal lives to overlap, though this contradicts everything we've been told about him and would obviously heighten the risk to his loved ones."
0	"It's just as ridiculous as it sounds - and, thankfully, played mostly for laughs."
0	"Charlie's Angels director McG used to know how to marshal a decent action scene (if nothing else), but that touch seems to have deserted him."
0	"Seeks to reposition Kevin Costner as a Neesony badass dad, casting him as a growly CIA type using a Parisian layover to juggle terrorist-offing with teaching daughter Hailee Steinfeld how to ride a bike."
0	"The film is just stupefyingly bad, failing to be funny whenever it isn't failing to be Taken, and wittering on forever like a lunatic on a bench."
0	Kevin Costner tries his hand at a Neeson-style B-movie and accidentally heralds the death of cinema as we know it.
0	The director McG seems uncertain whether he should concentrate on the action or the family drama.
0	"3 Days to Kill really cares about its parental themes, with neurotic and bizarre results."
0	"It makes you grateful for the laconic Michael Myers (Zombie's or Carpenter's), a psychopath with the common courtesy to shut the fuck up while spilling your entrails."
1	This one's really for diehard Zombie fans ... provided they weren't hoping he'd hit them with something new.
0	"...the coolest thing by far is the inclusion on the soundtrack of three songs from the James Gang's 1973 Bang album, featuring Tommy Bolin on guitar."
1	"It's involving but seldom deeply affecting, with the core drama continually shoved aside to examine more commonplace matters of parenting, abandonment and broken families."
1	Dellal's likably chaotic direction and a bevy of solid performances make sure the film's beating heart outweighs most of its contrivances.
0	"While it's hard to hate, it's even harder to like."
0	"After her character's trans cred is fully established, Fanning is pushed into the background and About Ray starts to feel like a bad Neil Simon comedy."
0	"It spends 92 Weinstein-approved minutes on the verge of telling a compelling story, and winds up stalling out telling a worthwhile one."
1	"When this well-acted picture calms down and focuses on real emotions, it proves a poignant, absorbing look at a modern family."
0	"Good intentions abound in ""3 Generations,"" a movie about a New York teenager transitioning from female to male, but they lead to a certain overzealousness."
0	"Yet another film where non-trans people learn valuable life lessons, complete with lots of hugs, while the actual trans character's story takes a backseat."
0	"[Dellal] way overcranks the ""movie"" neuroses of her three characters, muffling any human spark."
1	"If you can look past the sitcom humor, that late-in-the-game melodrama and the usual cliche about the mature child in a family of immature adults, ""3 Generations"" does a few important things."
0	"In the end, 3 Generations wants to to be about trans issues more than it really wants to live in them."
0	"Another bloodless example of Hollywood's cowardice in grappling with the world as it is. 3 Generations doesn't cut deep into the torn-from-the-headlines issue of trans rights. In fact, it doesn't cut at all."
0	Takes on the topic of gender dysphoria with a talented cast but not much to say.
0	"This is a movie that derives most of its suspense on whether a piece of paper will be signed, not a strong basis for dramatic tension."
0	"""3 Generations"" starts with a unique and intimate point of view, only to become yet another indie drama about the difficulties of motherhood."
0	"""3 Generations"" feels focus-grouped into existence, like its every development was fine-tuned to be as inoffensively on-message as possible in its treatment of trans issues."
1	"3 Generations is contrived, but the heartfelt performances keep the threadbare material on track-witty, warm and wise."
1	[Mastroianni and Gainsbourg] make for believable sisters who clearly adore each other.
1	Jacquot makes it much more compelling to watch his characters fall in love than it is to see them writhe and twist amid its complications.
1	"Gainsbourg - intuitive, wispily evanescent but strong - is the movie's pulsating impulse, even off-screen."
1	"Aside from the lead actresses' performances, what drives the movie is energetic, elliptical storytelling and humorous asides."
0	The screenplay relies on so many mechanical contrivances to make the story gripping that you can hear the rusty machinery clanking.
1	"Charged by dynamite performances and Bruni Coulais's ominous score, this romantic tragedy is more gripping than most thrillers."
1	"A romantic drama with the sensibility of a thriller, Benot Jacquot's 3 Hearts is a good example of how a talented director and cast can elevate the most tired of concepts."
0	"A few plunging camera moves and careful framings, and the appealing presence of skillful actors, don't compensate for the lazy lack of psychological or symbolic imagination."
1	"The overwrought plot mechanics are exasperating, but the lead actresses' exquisitely modulated performances get under the skin."
1	"A chance encounter, a missed rendezvous, a marriage and a torrid affair make for an intoxicating mix."
1	A French romantic drama directed as though it were a thriller.
1	"3 Hearts"" brings together an all-star team of French actresses in a movie about a love triangle that could not be more French unless everyone smoked more."
1	"Despite a slow start and jarring narration, ""3 Hearts"" entertains with its melodramatic amour fou."
0	"A tasteful, mildly intriguing romantic drama from writer-director Benot Jacquot."
1	"It leaves behind a nagging feeling, a suggestion there's more to the story than its story."
0	"Director Hilarion Banks dutifully captures all of it in a series of nicely shot extended takes, which would have been fine if the cast had been able to interact in some sort of uniform tone."
0	"""3 Holes and a Smoking Gun"" proves that there's a chasm-wide difference between talking about what constitutes - and actually being - great writing."
0	"While it might have made for a mildly diverting stage thriller -- the hugely successful Deathtrap, for instance, was built on similarly absurd contrivances -- the endlessly talky 3 Holes and a Smoking Gun founders onscreen."
1	"There's an unavoidable joie de vivre (symbolized by Rancho's meditative mantra ""All is well"") and a performance charm that make this one of the more naturally gregarious Bollywood imports."
1	3 Idiots takes a while to lay out its game plan but pays off emotionally in its second half.
1	"Despite its flaws, 3 Idiots conveys a powerful message about how valuable your friends can be when they push you toward reaching your own highest potential."
1	"This quirky well-acted film proves, as the title track says, that generally 'all is well' with commercial Hindi cinema."
1	Finally touching in its simplicity.
0	"The change in tone, from swiftly destabilizing drama to outright fantasy, feels less like Kim provocatively switching gears, and more like he's painted himself into a corner."
1	"Alternately witty, caustic, tender and endlessly imaginative and unpredictable, this latest film from one of Korea's most idiosyncratic and prolific directors is as confident as its resourceful hero, Tae-suk."
1	Kim Ki-duk's touching and improbable love story is pleasingly mysterious without being too difficult and a little gimmicky but not annoyingly so.
0	"Artful and engrossing, but the hero's insolent silences get to be a pain."
0	Raises questions that are more frustrating than provocative.
1	"Kim's wittiest effort to date, with a wordless performance by Jae Hee that recalls Keaton and Chaplin."
1	"It takes talent to entice an audience without any dialogue. In the case of South Korea's Kim Ki-Duk, he's not just good at silence; his oddball artistry depends on it."
1	"For all its pretense, 3-Iron is never pretentious and is so beautiful to look at."
1	3-Iron is a romance of tenderness and increasingly poignant silence.
1	"A hypnotic, almost wordless love story about transience physical and spiritual."
1	An uncanny spiritual exploration of the unlikeliest of great loves.
1	"Here is where things get murky, intriguingly so."
1	"Seems more ghostly than ghastly, a movie with a life all its own."
1	"A lyrical, sporadically violent tale of love on the run that gradually turns into something spooky, poetic and disarmingly gentle."
1	Delicate and subtle.
1	This enigmatic and in some ways maddening motion picture has the power to haunt every viewer it reaches.
1	"It's actually quite satisfying, in a weird, magical-realism sort of way that manages to disturb and confound as much as it appeases the romantic."
1	Kim works with the barest of materials but returns the viewer's attention to the pure visual pleasure of filmmaking.
0	Moves from a strangely spiritual reality to a really strange spirituality -- and leaves its best parts behind.
1	"A mesmerizing, offbeat, violent, playful yet serious parable."
0	What is meant to be profoundly puzzling can start to seem just theatrically silly.
1	"3-Iron may not be a horror movie, but it is still haunting."
1	"For the most part they achieve a delicate balancing act, mixing near-silent comedy with an old-fashioned sense of whimsy."
1	"A movie meant to be taken on faith more than anything else. The more you can grant it, the greater the reward."
1	"What is so engaging about the film is the way its director, Ki-duk Kim, manages to keep our interest intensely focused on the couple."
1	"If the snail's pace doesn't send you to sleep, you'll be rewarded with a tender and unusual love story."
0	"Needless to say, a lot of unresolved issues rise from hibernation during this rural weekend, but the characters, situations and dialogue too seldom escape cliche in Gabriel Cowan's watchable but unmemorable feature."
1	"The film features three gifted actors -- Wes Bentley, Amber Tamblyn and Vincent Piazza -- doing their best to animate a very stale script."
0	"A Frankenstein of a movie, an unhappy creature stitched together out of the body parts of other movies."
0	"Even in this conglomerate era of marketed, predigested mediocrity, this Disney movie slips instantly into the humdrum"
0	"The film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy, a fantasy or an adventure film."
1	Can the trio use their ninja secrets to escape? Will granddad defeat the gun-runner in hand-to-hand combat? If you can't guess the answers to these questions you are under 11 and will absolutely love this film.
1	Director Jon Turtletaub and editor David Rennie keep things zipping along.
1	"A lively, good-looking kiddie action comedy best left to those under 10."
0	A miserable ripoff of The Karate Kid.
0	"The movie is saddled with a junky visual style, haphazard editing and occasional out-of-focus shots."
0	Things are in a pretty sad state when Hulk Hogan gives a movie's most touching performance.
0	The franchise is losing altitude fast.
0	Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness
1	"Filled with martial-arts action, bathroom humor, and slapstick, 3 Ninjas Kick Back even has a politically correct kicker: The champion ninja is a girl."
0	"Who was this movie made for? Not for me, that's sure, but I have a hunch younger kids will find it satisfying."
0	"Instead of exalting physical grace and virtuosity, this film's slapdash action sequences resort repeatedly to the old trick of accelerating the action to the speed of a silent-film chase."
0	"Clearly made with an eye on the international market, this movie is set for the most part in Japan, shrewdly adding a female ninja to the three boys, thus broadening the potential demographics."
0	"3 Ninjas was a surprising box-office hit with the Saturday matinee family crowd, earning the highest cost-to-profit ratio of that year and instantly mandating this all-too-unnecessary sequel."
1	3 Ninjas Kick Back is just as lively and engaging as the 1992 original
0	Fantasy is one thing. 3 Ninjas Kick Back is something else entirely: junk food laced with testosterone.
0	"Robert Altman's would-be American art film (1977) is murky, snide, and sloppy."
1	"A gauzy, perfectly executed vacation in Doppelgnger-burg."
1	A spectacular artistic success.
1	"I have seen it many times, been through it twice in shot-by-shot analysis, and yet it always seems to be happening as I watch it. Recurring dreams are like that."
1	"Like a dream, it is most mysterious and allusive when it appears to be most precise and direct, when its images are of the recognizable world unretouched (as happens in the film from time to time) by camera filters or lab technicians."
1	"Throughout, Duvall is brilliant: she coins a brand-new caricature of the confident yet clueless single female, then suggests a real person underneath."
1	"The result is remarkable -- a semi-lucid, feverish tale of female relationships that disintegrates into a kind of woozy, oppressive madness."
1	Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is one of the most intensely touching stories ever made about a young adolescent.
1	A landmark in modern cinema.
1	"For all of Truffaut's mastery of the behind-the-camera aspects of The 400 Blows, an equal share of the credit must go to lead actor Jean-Pierre Laud."
1	"Amazingly, this vigorous effort is the first feature film of M. Truffaut, who had previously been (of all things!) the movie critic for a French magazine."
1	Still one of the cinema's most perceptive forays into childhood.
1	"Distinguished by its intensity of feeling and freewheeling use of the wide-screen frame, the film ranks among Truffaut's best."
1	"An engaging, moving film."
1	"Forget my curmudgeonly attitude and see it -- again, or for the first time -- for yourself."
1	A remarkable confluence of talents are at work here.
1	Seems forever young.
1	One of the first glistening droplets of the French New Wave.
1	"Distinguished by its naturalistic, quasi-documentary approach and an extraordinary central performance from the 12-year-old Jean-Pierre Laud, this is a blisteringly authentic story."
1	"It's a cornerstone of the French New Wave, and one of the greatest movies about childhood, from anywhere, ever."
1	"Henri Decae's black and white photography helped Truffaut enormously but what the director himself provides is a sense that though there is no easy answer to the problems of growing up, there is a hope that will never be wholly denied."
1	What is there to say about The 400 Blows that hasn't already been said?

1	
0	Tosses out a lot of potential what-ifs but never commits to any of them.
0	"Nearly all the spooky bits are achieved by pure aural assault, and the characters are such stock types, haunted by such predictable backstories, it's like watching Solaris performed by sock puppets."
1	"Contains some smart writing, funny dialogue, a cheeky production design, attractive leading actors and only occasional lapses into tastelessness."
0	This is as stupid as movies come.
0	"Lehmann, far from the glory days of Heathers, has made a movie about a hard-on, in which he relentlessly pounds a flaccid premise."
0	Mildly amusing but wholly unnecessary.
1	"If short on surprises, the screenplay has a fair share of snappy patter."
0	"Although not without its share of laughs, 40 Days is almost pornographic."
0	"A truly wretched sex comedy, or should we say non-sex comedy."
0	"The joke is yanked, inflated, stretched and strung out over the film's 93 minutes."
0	Even [Hartnett] can't overcome the lameness of the movie's increasingly obvious attempts to make horniness seem funny.
1	"It's risque, lewd, worthy of Balzac, 90-+ minutes of pretty hilarious smut."
1	"Just a kinder, gentler teensploitation comedy, but Hartnett's Matt, at least, invites the audience to graduate to something better."
0	It comes dangerously close to being America's first sex comedy without comedy.
1	"It's not Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or anything, but it's pretty darned good!"
1	"The movie is both exhilarating and depressing. The trouble is, I can't figure out which is more important."
0	"It does nothing to challenge the self-centredness of the smug little world it depicts, and everything to endorse it."
0	"A fluffy, dopey, but occasionally likable romantic comedy."
0	The slapdash and vulgar second half ... saps the good will engendered by some funny gags and heartthrob Josh Hartnett's ... heart-tuggingly earnest performance.
0	It's too mild to be crass; it's clumsy.
0	The underpinning misogyny of 40 Days and 40 Nights is only exceeded by its cynicism.
0	Eyeball-gougingly awful.
1	"The way Matt's fate plays out is consistently engaging, at once clever and insightful."
0	"A base guy flick that's clueless about women, relationships and emotion, and even flirts with sacrilege."
0	"Without the defence of teen ignorance, 40 Days is little more than soft-core sleaze."
0	An American Pie variation without the affection for its characters or original humor.
1	The details are fresh and writer Rob Perez's dialogue about sex has more complexity and nuance than we expect.
0	A one-joke sex comedy that seems to go on about 38 days and 38 nights too long.
0	"Josh Hartnett is good and I love Shannyn Sossamon I think she could become a big star, but this comedy is so wrong on so many levels."
0	It won't take 40 days and 40 nights to forget this turkey.
0	It has a way of wearing out what's supposed to be knockabout farce.
0	Squeamishly risqu teen sexcom.
1	"The material may be lightweight, but it's been shaped into a film that deserves to become a classic in an admittedly lightweight genre."
0	Nothing more than a lame vehicle for teen heartthrob Josh Hartnett.
0	You may feel like taking a vow of abstinence yourself -- at least from Hollywood youth-sex comedies.
1	"Given its drastically contrived nature, the script gets further than I expected."
0	In places 40 Days is actually quite witty but one can't help feeling that both Hartnett and Lehmann ... deserve better than this.
1	A howlingly comic revel in bad taste.
1	"Crude, sophomorically homophobic but frequently funny."
0	"Sticking to one joke in an unconscionably long film makes for a very stale, witless and repetitive comedy."
1	"I think this is one of the summer's biggest, most pleasant surprises."
0	"[Continues the trend] whereby ethnic inclusiveness can write a blank check for ethnic stereotyping and the homo-panic jokes are supposed to be on the hetero lunkheads, not on, y'know, the gays."
1	"The 40 Year-Old Virgin is buoyantly clever and amusing, a comedy of horny embarrassment that has the inspiration to present a middle-aged virgin's dilemma as a projection of all our romantic anxieties."
1	"If you're looking for a successor to There's Something About Mary and American Pie, look no further. It has arrived. And, if I may be so bold, this is more enjoyable than either of them."
1	"Filthy, funny and sweet in equal measure."
1	"The 40-Year-Old Virgin is surprisingly insightful, as buddy comedies go, and it has a good heart and a lovable hero."
1	"A nostalgic, sentimental and wholly bawdy comedy that will make you laugh until your sides hurt."
1	A surprisingly sweet and funny ode to male friendship and middle-aged love.
1	"A bracingly coarse, surprisingly tender movie."
1	"Those looking for the coarse, sometimes cheap laughs promised by the movie's attention-getting title won't be disappointed."
0	"The 40-Year-Old Virgin is too long, too sexist, and too -- shall we say -- flaccid."
1	"This character-driven comedy, with its excellent cast and let's-get-nutty finale featuring songs from Hair, is well worth your time."
1	It's worth making a date with The 40-Year-Old Virgin. You won't go home disappointed.
1	"The 40 Year-Old Virgin speaks to the geek in us all, it's democratic in its ridicule, and it makes you understand why sometimes a guy just wants to stay home and talk to his toys."
0	"The 40-Year-Old Virgin disarms us -- it is, at its heart, a sweet-natured romantic comedy. Unfortunately, you have to clear away a fair bit of debris to find that heart."
1	"Despite a very lowbrow premise, the profanity-packed script is hilarious, and it also has a good heart."
1	"It's a little long, a lot lowbrow. But The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a stitch. See it if you could use a laugh."
1	Steve Carell plays the title character in a charmingly bent comedy about a likable geek's progress from action figures to real action.
1	"Hilarious and imaginatively crude with a surprising sweet and subtle aftertaste that prevents it from flopping, limp and brainless, into the sugary abyss of romantic predictability."
1	"The whole film is about embarrassment, about those moments of clammy vulnerability when the world just turns and stares."
1	If only losing it was so good for everybody.
1	Such a well-balanced mix of the gross and crude with the sweet and sympathetic that it transcends its inadequacies in a way that may make even the most suspicious woman let down her guard.
1	"An undeniably likable quality helps make this smutty, silly late-summer entry more entertaining than many of its more polished counterparts."
1	"The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers some sparkling insights about the cumulative effects of performance anxiety, about how guys struggle with the transit from boys to men with little help from their pals."
1	The good-natured tone of the film and the wonderful comedic talents of the entire cast -- especially Carell -- make the gross-out moments charmingly relatable.
1	"The answer is, unequivocally, yes. Yes, Steve Carell can carry a movie."
1	[Carell's] touched us for the very first time.
1	Balances gross-out humor with moments of genuine wit and even a little warmth.
1	"Carell brings something funny, and oddly real to Andy -- a touch of embarrassment, a bit of self-loathing, a genuinely sweet concern."
1	"Carell and Apatow's script is so hip, funny and -- yes -- innocent that it's never offensive."
0	"At the risk of sounding like a party pooper, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is essentially the joke spelled out in the title stretched out for nearly two hours, with lots and lots of dead spots."
1	"A ribald, risqu yet surprisingly warm-hearted vehicle for Steve Carell."
1	"It's truly dirty and truly romantic at the same time, a combination that's very hard to pull off."
0	Count me among the naysayers.
1	"Apatow genuinely loves his hero, and the film's innate sweetness carries it through the rough patches of a funny comedy with a central relationship that isn't particularly funny."
1	"At its best it resembles one of those classic early-'80s comedies starring Steve Martin -- the thinking man's Woody Allen -- boasting an acute mix of desperation, dignity, lunacy and indecorous wit."
1	"The script is little more than an excuse for letting a bouncy team of sketch comics have their heads. Unlike most films pasted together in this way, it displays a certain cohesion."
1	"If it were 20 minutes shorter, it would be that much closer to perfect."
1	Unmemorable but fun as far as it goes...
0	It's boring enough while sober; only the heroic could stay focused on this film while high.
0	Its C-movie horror should only be experienced while under the influence when your judgment isn't at its best.
0	This big-budget period piece is more concerned with burnishing a legend than dramatizing a life.
0	"At the top of a new baseball season, it's hard not to root for a movie that's in it for the love of the game."
1	"If you want a sense of a true all-American hero, this film is a fine place to start."
1	"With 42, [Helgeland] expands his skills to turn a mountain of research into a cogent life story worth retelling."
1	"For all the hate and hostility it depicts, 42 is a film about decent-hearted people. Hate can be infectious, but so can decency. It's the decency you'll take away from 42."
0	"Rather than letting its hero's accomplishments and behavior speak for themselves, Helgeland hammers home every achievement and then puts a halo around it, as if anyone won't get it otherwise."
0	A relentlessly formulaic biopic that succeeds at transforming one of the most compelling sports narratives of the 20th century into a home run of hagiography.
1	"The beauty of the Jackie Robinson story is that it's so naturally inspiring that not even lethal amounts of bombast, sentimental writing, soaring strings, hammy acting or desperate hyperbole can tarnish it beyond repair."
0	"By burnishing Jackie Robinson's legend to such an unnaturally high polish, 42 does Robinson the man (and the actor who plays him, the relative newcomer Chadwick Boseman) a disservice."
1	"Robinson's story had so much drama in real life, and his sacrifice and pain made such a lasting influence, that ""42"" ends up being effective in its gee-whiz way almost in spite of itself."
1	"For all the 1940s hokiness of 42, with its big cars and big bands and peanuts and Cracker Jack, it's a wonderful surprise to see that there's a recognizable human being at the center of the hoopla."
1	"42 escapes the trappings of sheer hero worship largely thanks to Boseman, whose relative anonymity eliminates any potential star baggage. More than that, he strikes a tough balance."
0	Mr. Helgeland's ponderously reverential biopic is a string of unearned runs.
1	"It's a great and triumphant story, and writer and director Brian Helgeland (an Oscar winner for his L.A. Confidential screenplay) brings it to life in burnished, old-fashioned Hollywood style."
1	"Though not accurate in every particular, the movie mostly succeeds in respecting the facts of history and the personality of its hero, and in reminding audiences why he mattered."
1	"Well-paced and often riveting, and manages to inspire while remaining true to the sport and to the player who changed it and all of professional sport forever."
0	There's not enough of Robinson's back story to convey the full drama of his place in history.
1	"Shameless, sure. But effective."
1	"Even the most woefully sports-ignorant probably know all the plot points here by heart. For all its feel-good sports-movie predictability, 42 ... is surprisingly effective and even, at a couple of points, moving."
1	"As Robinson, Boseman has both physical grace and sly charm."
1	"Ironically, the most valuable player here is Harrison Ford, giving one of the best performances of his career as Brooklyn Dodgers manager Branch Rickey."
1	"It's worth seeing because the film is competently presented and the story is inherently important, but I couldn't help be disappointed that the result wasn't more fresh or visionary."
0	A likable hagiography as nuanced as a plaque at the Cooperstown Hall of Fame.
1	"The inspirational movie named for Robinson's number is too dignified to throw audiences a curveball, let alone a knockdown pitch, but its solid fundamentals make it a winner."
1	It's a sports film nonsports fans can love; it's a family film that never preaches; it's a biopic that also takes in the world and people around its subject.
0	"""42"" settles for too little, for being an attractive primer, an introduction to the legend of Robinson and the faith that saw him through."
1	"If you want a crowd-pleaser that confirms your belief in America's steady, pre-ordained progression away from racism, this will do fine."
1	"""42"" can feel incomplete (the bland music and the filmmaker's obsession with dates and places are problematic), yet at the same time it offers a very good place to start."
1	Helgeland has given us an impressive introduction to one of the most important men in U.S. history. But you can't help wanting more.
1	"There are many less flattering things you could say about a movie than that it's enjoyable in a square, uncomplicated, stirringly old-fashioned way."
0	"It's thoroughly embalmed in the glossy lacquer of conventional baseball movies, and limited further by trying to deal with the horrors of racism in that context."
1	"""42"" is competent, occasionally rousing and historically respectful - but it rarely rises above standard, old-fashioned biography fare. It's a mostly unexceptional film about an exceptional man."
1	"""This is a competent but mostly unexceptional film about a most extraordinary man."""
1	This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history.
0	The filmmaking is TV-movie-of-the-week dull and Robinson's ordeal is hammered home to the exclusion of virtually everything else in his life.
1	"""A kind and decent film, though it doesn't add to Robinson's legacy."""
1	"[Boseman] captures, in a clenched jaw or a sidelong glance, a lifetime's worth of dearly attained dignity and barely contained rage."
0	"In the hallowed frames of 42, the legend is front and centre and still inspiring. Too bad the more interesting man is nowhere to be seen."
1	"If anybody deserves to be portrayed as noble, it's Jackie Robinson."
1	"An inspiring, old-school biopic that doesn't pull any punches in depicting the ugly racism that Jackie Robinson faced on a daily basis as the first African-American player in Major League Baseball."
1	"A stirring, straightforward and ultimately soaring portrayal of Robinson's historic entry into Major League Baseball in 1947."
1	"A square, uninventive, but detailed and stirring bio-pic devoted to the two years in an athlete's life that changed a nation."
1	"Rousing climaxes, mostly well-earned, arrive every half-hour."
1	"Boseman gives Robinson personal self-assurance to match his physical confidence; and it's enjoyable to watch Ford stretching into a character role as the stubborn, shrewd but good-hearted Rickey."
1	"It's a gloriously sentimental, shamelessly enjoyable slice of apple pie that sugar-coats on a Willy Wonka scale."
0	"I wanted to kick Ford/Rickey into next Christmas, and you can add the movie. Its corny triumphalism is barely bearable."
0	"So 66 years after Robinson became the first black major league baseball player, here we are with 42, which has been made with such reverence for Robinson's importance that Robinson is barely there."
1	"A dramatization of what Robinson did and what it required, 42 will not disappoint."
1	"It's not easy to play a stoic, but Boseman anchors the movie, and when he smiles, 42, already such a warm story of such cold times, gets even brighter."
1	"The style of the film, lush and traditional, is nothing special, but the takeaway, a daily struggle for dignity, is impossibly moving."
1	"The story isn't much more than a hit parade of ""Shut up, racist"" moments -- Alan Tudyk's opposing manager just oozes with venomous talk -- but its blunt force is enough to get the job done."
1	Berkeley choreographs chorines and camera with mischievous dexterity.
1	The liveliest and one of the most tuneful screen musical comedies that has come out of Hollywood.
0	"This 1933 film is the best known of the Warner Brothers Depression-era musicals, though it doesn't compare in dash and extravagance to later entries in the cycle."
1	"Modern musicals start here, and Busby Berkeley's genius bursts into full flower."
0	"This is energetic, pulpy exploitation from the UK that might just claim back a small corner of the multiplex audience from the relentless onslaught of cynical Hollywood garbage. And for that at least, 4.3.2.1 can't be dismissed as all bad. Just mostly."
0	"This film whooshes wildly all over the place, and it's got plenty of energy, but nothing about it is convincing for a single moment, and the acting is on the torpid side."
1	These girls are brilliantly un-victimy and always come out fighting. If only they weren't incessantly paraded about in their underwear for the viewing pleasure of men.
0	"It brings me no joy to say it, but Clarke's filmmaking is like a narcissistic strut from someone who needs to brush up on walking."
0	"Noel Clarke, blowing his promise as the debut director of Kidulthood, blends youth romp with international thriller."
0	"The multithreads, a la Pulp Fiction, weave and collide, but it's all too linear, too telegraphed, its influences too obvious, its edges sanded down by compromise."
0	"Like most of those movies that purport to tell it like it is for the fashionably chic young, the result is as cheesy and sentimental as it pretends to be streetwise."
1	I regret to say I enjoyed nearly every minute.

0	This is pretty standard not-with-a-bang-but-with-a-whimper-punctuated-by-an-occasional-blowup stuff.
1	"It's both chamber drama and experimental found-footage film, relying heavily on appropriated media to provide context and subtext to its disaster fiction."
0	The film lacks any serious attempt to grapple with mortality.
0	"Ferrara's thin idea for a movie - life goes on, even when it's about to stop - would have been a lot better had he given his characters more to do."
1	"Ferrara movingly celebrates connection, cooking life down to just its barest essence: a man, a woman and a need."
0	Ferrara doesn't give his protagonists room to do much beyond have arguments and sex (though the intimacy is shot well).
1	"Your last day - or, as it happens, the whole planet's last day - will be just like every other one. Mr. Ferrara makes this point with ingenuity and characteristic thrift by using found news footage to provide images of apocalypse."
0	"Dafoe, with his angular, ever-watchable Edvard Munch features, plays well off the impish Leigh, but sadly, they have little to do besides a ""Last Tango at Armageddon"" riff, albeit with a genuinely moving finale."
1	The mechanics of the pending cataclysm don't interest Ferrera so much as the emotional stakes: How do people act when there's no future left?
0	"Rehashing old arguments in the hours before certain death is a tedious waste of time - theirs, and ours."
1	"If the end of the world was just hours away, would New Yorkers still be able to get takeout? Yes, if Abel Ferrara's mind-bending ""4:44 Last Day on Earth'' is any indication."
0	"Though it gains traction toward the end, viewers may finally feel puzzled or indifferent. You expect a bit more from the end of the world."
1	"Could easily elicit accusations of misogyny -- especially given its percussive, unrelenting but eminently realistic use of the C-word -- but it's actually, at its best, an acute, unblinking portrait of misogyny in practice, not a misogynistic text itself."
1	"Malcolm Venville, in an assured directorial debut, builds suspense with steady effectiveness."
0	"Aiming for black comedy and a redemptive satire on self-deluding male machismo, ham fisted debut director Malcolm Venville instead gives his cast enough rope to hang themselves rather than the characters they play."
1	"Without a crack cast, attempting to pull off a film with such a static, contemplative plot would have been impossible. They succeed, just about, but at times it feels like a dangerous game."
0	"It talks the talk - in fact, it talks and talks and talks the talk. But the walk isn't happening."
1	"Hard as Winstone visibly tries, he can't stop them stealing the movie, a plum actors' piece which both gains and loses points by soberly stalling its own plot. A thoughtful anticlimax is ... well, still an anticlimax."
1	"Malcolm Venville's intriguing and entertaining debut manages to question without patronising. And he's extracted a magnificent performance from Winstone who personifies the anatomy of a breakdown, swaying seamlessly from hurt to anger to violence."
0	"Welcome to the new sub-genre: neo-gangsterism. Think of neoclassicism or neo-Nazism, then think of them both combined."
0	"A brooding Pinteresque menace hangs over this chamber-piece of London lowlife, though any expectation of Louis Mellis and David Scinto's screenplay duplicating the thrills of their previous effort, Sexy Beast, is to be frustrated."
0	"Distinctive as it is, there's not much in the end that remains in the memory except the performances. And there ought to be more."
0	There's a difference between exposing misogyny and crassly exploiting it.
0	"A very strange, often terrible affair that is nevertheless mesmerizing, in a limited way."
0	The effect is to clobber you with lines that were already clobbersome and needed no extra emphasis. It starts to feel less like a thriller than an actors' workshop.
0	"If you value your I.Q., avoid a horror called 44 Inch Chest like V.D."
0	The cast to die for is almost entirely wasted in this machismo-marinated slab of Brit-crime nastiness.
0	All moody buildup and no -- I mean no -- real suspense.
0	Think of 44 Inch Chest as a piece of chamber music and you can compensate for the thinness of its story and the lack of visual distinction.
0	Even a great British cast and obscenity-laden gangland dialogue aren't enough to make what amounts to an extended acting exercise into much of a movie.
1	"It's sometimes difficult to discern whether the filmmakers are dissecting male bonding, ritualized aggression and sexual anxiety or celebrating it."
0	I just felt like it was not going anywhere after a while and I did feel like I was trapped in a play that wasn't really working for me.
0	"It's an interesting spectacle, but not enough to carry a movie."
0	"The whole thing feels like middle-period Mamet with English accents, and not much to say."
0	"Is this a documentary about a porn professional? Or a gym rat? Neither. It's a stagy, half-entertaining, half-tedious acting competition between five excellent Englishmen."
0	"The frequently profane dialogue suggests David Mamet on an off-night (so does Malcolm Venville's claustrophobia-inducing direction), though the first-rate cast works hard."
1	"With violence on the menu, it's a guilty pleasure to watch these stage-trained hambones unleash a rapid-fire roundelay of righteous indignation."
1	A quietly moving and deceptively tragic look at aging romance haunted by past mysteries.
1	"Haigh's skill is to make 45 Years feel like it's been cribbed from a story that was whirring long before he began documenting it, and that will continue long after the credits. In a sense, that's true."
1	"Do not expect blazing emotional fireworks, just finely calibrated performances and deep reserves of inner torment."
1	Haigh's casting choices for the two lead roles pay rich dividends.
1	"It's a film of small moments and tiny gestures that leaves a very, very big impression."
1	A moving and absorbing drama featuring two performers offering a lifetime's wisdom and technique in their performances.
1	"Haigh's very fine, classically modulated film keeps these questions alive until literally its last shot, and lets them jangle their way through you for days afterwards."
1	"[A] devastating, glinting miniature of a drama."
1	"Haigh has a miniaturist's gift for nuance, pressing a hundredweight of personal history into fleeting exchanges. Rampling and Courtenay are just as immaculate."
1	"It is in the best sense a woman's film, albeit made by a man."
1	"Rampling has never received an Oscar nomination, but she deserves one for this performance. Courtenay, who has two Oscar nods under his belt, rates another one for helping Rampling reach this peak"
1	This sober British drama showcases Rampling in a superb performance.
1	"Less is not only more in ""45 Years,"" Andrew Haigh's study of marriage and memory, it is eloquently and anguishingly more, and what's unspoken is almost deafening."
1	"Director Andrew Haigh keeps to a realistic, minimalist approach as do his two stars - each of them mainstays of classic British cinema, and together a formidable duo."
1	"Mr. Courtenay, a naturally demonstrative actor, registers a convincing blend of longing, confusion and shame. Ms. Rampling, a stiller, deeper-running pool, conveys emotions so strange and intense that they don't quite have names."
1	"45 Years is about the relationship of the present to the past and of our past loves to our present lives-a relationship that, like any good marriage, remains a total mystery."
1	"At some point in her 50-year career, Rampling became one of the world's great actresses. Driven by her and Courtenay's work, and by director Andrew Haigh's limpid style, the film is devastating."
1	"As we gaze at and listen to these paradigmatic performers, whose characters reflect on nearly a half-century together - almost as long as the leads have been icons - the movie becomes a tender unofficial career retrospective for both."
1	"A devastatingly intimate tale about a couple unsettled late-in-life, by an unexpected revelation."
1	"At a spare 95 minutes, this is a film of no wasted scenes or unnecessary subplots, stripped down to something tough and focused and vivid."
1	"Has so much to say about growing old and past regrets and relationships, and its power comes from articulating so little of that in words."
1	"I haven't been this shook up by married seniors under duress as they hang out in the kitchen since ""Amour."""
1	"""45 Years"" is a quietly explosive film, a potent drama with a nuanced feel for subtlety and emotional complications."
1	"Pairing Rampling with Courtenay was an ingenious move, and not only because the two perform a beautifully calibrated pas de deux."
1	"The devastating truth of 45 Years, so beautifully wrought, is that even the most devoted couples are made up of two people who are essentially alone."
1	"Haigh understands, as his actors certainly do, that it is possible to hold more than one love in one's heart. This may not be the most romantic of conceptions, but it hits home."
0	Haigh makes his intentions so obvious-and makes his actors display them so blatantly-that all imagination is foreclosed.
1	casts a hell of a spell. And Courtenay and Rampling reward the film with performances of uncommon subtlety and feeling.
1	A movie that will shatter you.
1	"""45 Years"" is a movie about intuition and inner lives, and you have to look fast to catch all its resonances."
1	"Both actors deliver a master class in expression by understatement. The most unsettling of ghosts, we are moved to realize, are the ones we try hardest to deny."
1	"45 Years is a study in economy, in the beautiful symmetry of word and image and music."
1	"This is not an actual horror movie, but the tension grows so great in some scenes you might mistake it for one."
1	"Haigh knows how to thread a story in a way that makes it feel deliberate and spontaneous, so that when it reaches its climax, viewers feel that it's both inevitable and utterly devastating."
1	"It's cathartic, and moving, without any of the usual obvious contrivances or manipulations."
1	"Sometimes, just when you think you have things figured out, life throws a curve ball."
1	"45 Years exposes the paradoxical balance of the successful marriage, one that requires a sentimental suspension of disbelief on the one hand and a hard-headed ability to deal with the everyday on the other."
1	"What's the big deal? How does an entire film come of this? There are satisfying answers to these questions, but to state them would be to ruin a perfectly good movie."
1	"Daringly unsentimental, ""45 Years"" makes a persuasive case that marriage demands not only patience, but guts."
1	"In the beautifully acted drama""45 Years,"" a marriage lives and dies; we watch its agonized struggle, like a butterfly impaled on a pin."
1	"To know is not the same as to possess, and at any rate, possession is never permanent."
1	"If the subject matter is familiar, Haigh approaches it in good faith - avoiding both sentimentality and cynicism, and seeking out fresh insight rather than settling for cliche."
1	"This story, which grows richer the more you think about it, is a rueful acknowledgment of the fact that few of us can."
1	"How many great movies could be written across the enigmatic, profound face of Charlotte Rampling? Hundreds? Thousands? At any rate, Andrew Haigh's 45 Years is one of them."
1	"We're going to need a bigger cage. The ""Jaws"" jokes write themselves with ""47 Meters Down,"" a surprisingly effective shark-in-the-dark thriller that makes for frighteningly fun summer escapism."
1	It more or less gets the job done (especially if you're handing out bonus points for a title that traffics in the metric system).
1	"This flick is a summer diversion, pure and simple, so don't expect a deep message. Except, that is, when you go on vacation next, leave your scuba diving equipment at home."
1	A formulaic but effective thriller about two sisters trapped beneath the waves in shark-infested waters.
0	"47 Meters Down sinks rather than swims, even if there are a few buoyant moments along the way."
0	"""47 Meters Down"" - despite a clever final section - struggles to extract tension from clamor and agitation."
1	A lean and mean little B-movie that skillfully plays on our fear of what lies beneath the waves. Director Johannes Roberts ratchets up the tension with precision.
0	The only thing this so-called thriller has going for it is widescreen cinematography by Mark Silk.
0	"The movie's third act takes an abrupt swerve in a less plausible, more heightened direction, serving up the conventional heroics that acts one and two had studiously avoided."
1	"What unfolds is a smart, tense nail-biter that's bound to leave some clinging to the shoreline this summer."
0	A movie that's meant to fill this summer's smart-low-budget-thriller slot. Except it's not very smart and it's not very thrilling.
0	An effectively disorienting undersea aesthetic and some inspired late jolts and chills can't fully counterbalance the schlock that keeps dragging this one down.
1	"It's taut and suspenseful, and there's a jittery vibe to the whole thing."
1	"The movie's saving grace is the visceral response that sharks produce, even more than four decades after Jaws first had audiences screaming."
1	"While the plot is a bit shaky in parts, the overall effect of creating needed tension and some outright, out-of-your-seat jumps of fright is quite effective."
0	The screenplay by Johannes Roberts and Ernest Riera is a weirdly clunky work that never seems to know what it's doing.
1	It's gratifying to see a summer popcorn movie where a simple idea goes a long way.
0	"Even at 89 minutes, you can feel the oxygen running out of this movie."
1	"This low budget but highly-effective horror film is exactly the kind of movie that legendary Hollywood D-movie producer Roger Corman would have knocked out in the '70s: plenty of writhing female limbs, no surprises."
0	"The script is a particular disaster area. ""Emotional"" beats between the sisters, dismally mistimed, prompt guffaws."
0	An unpretentious film whose destiny it is to toil in the shadow of Steven Spielberg's Jaws.
0	47 Metres Down is competently enough made but suffers from a plot almost as rickety as the ancient cage in which the two sisters descend into the deep to view the sharks.
1	A silly but intensely terrifying addition to the wave of shark thrillers out there.
1	"After the success last year of The Shallows, here's another schlocky but brazenly entertaining thriller pitting American woman against homicidal shark in Mexico."
1	"But on its own B-movie terms 47 Meters Down works just fine, not wearing out its welcome thanks to its quick set-up, rapid pacing and brief running time."
0	Feel free to stay out of the water with this one.
0	"Uncaged improves on the first film only with its ending: This one boasts a modestly effective twist rather than a truly moronic one. Encouraging, but not nearly enough to justify a third trip down this 47-meter well."
0	"It is not often that you watch a killer-shark movie and start feeling sympathy for the shark. But 47 Meters Down: Uncaged is no ordinary killer-shark movie - it is much, much worse."
1	"Set disbelief aside, and primal phobias may well suffice to get you happily to the other side of this adventure."
1	"The dialogue may be banal - ""This place is insane, right?"" and ""We can't give up!"" - yet there is an unpredictability to Roberts' action sequences, both nodding to the conventions of shark thrillers and subverting them."
1	"As an unrelated sequel to a film that was originally set to premiere on the bottom shelf of a supermarket, this is better than it needs to be."
1	"There's little in ""47 Meters Down: Uncaged"" that really sticks. The shocks, however, are consistently well-timed, and for the audience that seeks out a movie like this one that's probably enough."
1	"Returning to the well for his second film in which thrills are in more abundant supply than oxygen, Johannes Roberts reconfirms the enduring dramatic alchemy of a hungry shark and a smorgasbord of delicious-looking people."
0	"This brainless sequel to 47 Meters Down forsakes much of what made that 2017 survival thriller the lean and mean success it was, a credible shark threat being first and foremost."
0	"The action is unclear and the menace unconvincing. The tin-eared dialogue - of which there is a shocking amount, for a movie set largely underwater - doesn't help either."
0	The last gasp of a shark saga that didn't need to come up for air.
0	"Like most films that are set almost entirely underwater, this is not a particularly appealing film from a visual perspective."
1	"The film ups the ante on its predecessor, resulting in a pure, rather beautiful example of genre as ritual."
0	"While the visuals are lovely to behold, this unremarkable version of the classic 18th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving."
0	"""47 Ronin"" would have been more fun if it kept swinging its sword instead of falling on it."
0	"The eagerness of the major studios to cozy up to Asian markets yields awkward results in 47 Ronin, a lumpy 3D epic from Universal that fuses Japanese historical legend with generic CGI-heavy action fantasy."
0	"As impressive as these visual elements prove to be, the film struggles to grab and maintain audiences' interest, whether or not they know the underlying legend by heart."
0	"Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly."
0	"An overlong, underwhelming movie now hitting theaters that certainly wasn't worth the wait."
0	"""47 Ronin"" can't entirely paper over the void at its center, traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering."
0	Memo to Hollywood: Find another use for Keanu Reeves.
0	"The basics of the story remain unchanged, but it's the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle, be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected Lord of the Rings villains."
0	"[Rinsch] careens from one set piece to another with a blend of passable 3-D and dialogue so wooden, it seems dubbed."
0	"Believe it or not, for all its additions, it's too respectful. You want it to be funnier, crazier."
0	"47 Ronin is admirably devoted to its material, but it's almost tedious to watch."
0	"In spite of its enjoyable, easy-to-exploit aspects, ""47 Ronin"" is a big budget spectacle hamstrung by its need to be at once flippant and respectful of its honor-driven source material."
0	"Solemn as a funeral march, humorless as your junior high principal, as Japanese as a grocery-store California roll, Keanu Reeves's let's-mope-about-and-kill-ourselves samurai drama has exactly three things going for it."
0	"Hollywood's latest play for the growing Asian market revisits the ancient Japanese legend of self-sacrifice, hoping to offset its garbled narrative and grinding humourlessness with 3D and Keanu Reeves as a samurai Jesus."
0	A fairer title might have been Ronin in the Gloamin'.
0	"Kenji Mizoguchi's original movie (1941), based on true events in early 18th-century Japan, is a classic. This one is a dud that can barely walk."
1	"A singular viewing experience: a multi-colored downer fantasy which combines bursts of imagination with a bleak worldview, resulting in something that rarely feels mainstream."
0	"There's nothing pretty or exciting about this movie (inexplicably, it's in 3-D), even when all anyone's doing is fighting."
0	The pacing is cloddish and tone unaccountably dour.
1	"[It] is more memorable for its characters than for its high style, more a series of energetic scenes than a collection of handsome imagery. It has life, ferocity and humor in place of icy, stylized elegance, and that seems more than a fair trade."
1	"The movie's story is nothing to write home about. It's pretty routine. What makes the movie special is how it's made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too -- quirky and funny."
1	"A down-the-line thriller, plain, fast and efficient."
1	"All in all, a superior genre piece, if not the height of Hill's artistry."
0	"Neither jokes nor fast, flashy action can completely distract audiences from the failure to establish an authentic, rather than a purely conventional connection between Nolte and Murphy."
1	"What makes it work are Walter Hill's switchblade-sharp direction, and the inspired teaming of Nolte and Murphy."
1	Haunting.
1	"Although Khrzhanovsky has several tricks up his sleeve, 4's most provocative quality is its ironic sur+ of beauty."
1	"The terminally bleak meets the hypnotically beautiful in the Russian cryptogram 4, directed by the newcomer Ilya Khrzhanovsky."
0	"In spite of a handful of striking images, 4 never resolves into anything special."
1	"It's not always clear exactly what's happening in this dark tale, full of barking dogs and slabs of meat. But you won't be able to take your eyes from the screen; nor will you quickly forget this fiercely original eye-popper."
0	The picture finally bogs down in a seemingly endless spectacle of grossness and ghoulishness.
1	"This seriously weird pic has a few flat stretches, but its bawdy comedy, bravura sound design and uncanny atmosphere will turn on auds with a taste for deeply oddball fare and baffle others."
1	"There's much in the movie that won't translate to audiences this side of the Volga, but there's also a humor and a fierce filmmaking intelligence that demand attention."
0	"The result is a teasing, if trying, exercise."
1	"Decidedly not for everyone, 4 is an incomparably unhinged act of disinterment, but it's also a fiercely willed feat of rebirth, raw and bloody and screamingly alive."
1	"If your art film tastes lean toward orderliness and tidy metaphors, you could spend the two hours of Russian filmmaker Ilya Khrzhanovsky's fearless and mesmerizing debut feature."
1	"It's another blast of vibrant, vicious, gloomy electricity from the always-surprising Russian film scene, and the beginning of an important career."
1	"This 2004 debut feature by Russian director Ilya Khrzanovsky is puzzling, intriguing, and often compelling, apparently set in the present but magical and futuristic in tone."
1	"The sheer surfeit of ideas in 4's first half hour alone could fuel a dozen warped movies; presented in this kind of rush, they leave you agape."
1	What the film does offer is gorgeous shots of the French countryside and an idea of how different gay men navigate present-day life in France.
1	"A pleasingly discursive road movie for our geosocial age, writer-director Jrme Reybaud's debut narrative feature navigates la France profonde with the help of Grindr."
0	Badly needs some cutting and some focusing of all the material Reybaud shot of Pierre on the road because similar scenes with too many different characters start to blur and cancel each other out.
1	"What makes 4 Days In France special, though, is that it's far more expansive than its basic premise would suggest."
1	"A sly, sexy and strangely disarming cruise along the queerer backroads of rural France that marks an intriguing debut for writer-director Jrme Reybaud."
1	"While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the ""not for everybody"" critical hedge."
1	Mesmerizing ...
1	"Writer-director Jrme Reybaud has crafted an assured film for his narrative-feature debut. ""4 Days in France"" has a strong vision, even as its protagonist simply wanders across France."
1	"At nearly two and a half hours, the film feels a little overlong, but the acute sense of transience makes a strong impression."
1	4 Little Girls brilliantly captures a moment in American history and tells an achingly painful story of injustice and family loss.
1	
1	"A thoughtful, graceful, quietly devastating account."
1	"It is Lee's job as a film maker to imbue these images with life, and that's a task he easily accomplishes."
1	"There is mostly sadness and regret at the surface in 4 Little Girls, but there is anger in the depths, as there should be."
1	"The big part of Lee's film commemorates the lives of the '4 little girls' who died, through the memories of parents, siblings and friends."
1	"A compelling, straightforward account of a deeply sorrowful and pivotal event in the civil rights movement."
1	"There isn't an ounce of flab or hype, and the story it tells is profoundly affecting."
1	"Only a filmmaker so resourceful, so entirely confident in his practiced craft, could have made such a quilt out of patches of nightmare and nostalgia -- of gospels, ghosts, and grief."
0	A sympathetic performance by Richard Jenkins does little to dispel the stale atmosphere here
0	4 Minute Mile is cobbled together with every sports underdog clich imaginable.
0	"More than one interior scene looks underlit for effect,but that's at least something else to think about as the film goes through its paces."
1	"It's a moving, if occasionally heavy-handed, sports drama that deserves a wider audience than it is probably going to find in its limited release."
1	"A finely written and directed sports drama with a lead performance by rising star Kelly Blatz so deep and affecting it often evokes Timothy Hutton's Oscar-winning turn in ""Ordinary People."""
0	A by-the-numbers tale of inspiration through perspiration.
0	"4 Minute Mile at least has the decency to acknowledge that it's aware of its underdog sports-movie clichs, especially the ones that made The Karate Kid such an '80s classic."
1	"Even if the story itself has been around the track a couple of times, veterans like these know how to bring it safely home."
1	A harrowing tale of the grim lengths to which two young women will go to end an unwelcome pregnancy in a totalitarian society that is indifferent to their fate unless it involves punishing them.
1	"Pitch perfect and brilliantly acted, 4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days is a stunning achievement."
1	"Suffice to say that what's done with plot elements is as surprising as the rest of this gripping, satisfying film."
1	Spare drama.
1	...a sharp political commentary about free-market forces in a socialist bureaucracy where nearly everything is regulated by the government.
1	A beautiful and formally compelling work of art.
1	"Themes of altruism and selfishness colour the harrowing realism; the camerawork is skilful, with many scenes unfolding in one, locked frame; and the performances are superb."
1	The film favours naturalism over polemics and is all the more forceful because of it.
1	"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days unspools as dispassionately as a security camera video. There are no judgments rendered here, only truths that arise from harrowing insights."
1	"Never surrendering its grip on the viewer, 4 Months is the rare film with gravity and speed -- a moral tale in the form of a suspense thriller."
1	It conveys unblinking and despairing emotional truth with enough intensity to leave you gasping for air.
1	"The frigid stoicism of 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days barely contains the filmmaker's fury."
1	Brilliant.
1	"There is no escape from desperation in this not-so-long-ago Romania, but 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days is striking, original and memorable."
1	"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days is a movie one watches in a state of mounting dread. Romanian writer-director Cristian Mungiu's brilliantly discomfiting second feature is one long premonition of disaster."
1	"4 Months sounds more or less unwatchable. [Director] Mungiu's pacing is so sure, however, in its switching from loose to taut, and the concentration of his leading lady so unwavering, that the movie feels more like a thriller than a moody wallow."
1	What you see will floor you.
1	"In 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, a ferocious, unsentimental, often brilliantly directed film, the camera doesn't follow the action, it expresses consciousness itself."
1	"Nothing good happens in 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, and yet no lover of greatness in filmmaking will want to look away from one of the very best movies of 2007."
1	Captures the tenor of a particular era with uncanny force.
1	Harrowing and heart-stopping.
1	This is the first memorable movie of 2008.
1	"Cristian Mungiu's elegantly crafted, brilliantly acted film, set in Bucharest in the late 1980s, near the end of the vile Ceausescu regime, needs special help in finding the audience it deserves."
1	"4 Months rings true, one reason being that the story was inspired by real-life events."
1	...a true horror story.
1	"Oleg Mutu's deft handheld camerawork and Mungiu's meticulous reconstruction of Ceausescu-era Romania, in all its corruption, hypocrisy and drab cleanliness, create an overweening atmosphere of dread."
1	"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 days feels like a kind of appendix -- and a bursting one at that -- to Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue."
1	"For film connoisseurs who are interested in how far the medium can go in depicting human stories with realism at its most confrontational and even discomfiting, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days will provide a bracing breath of fresh cinematic air."
1	"It may seem perverse to contend that a movie with such a harrowing subject is nevertheless revivifying. But the New Wave of Romanian cinema is the most exciting in the world right now. 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days is its latest masterpiece."
1	Writer-director Cristian Mungiu confirms the Romanian cinema renaissance while creating a paradoxical marvel: a bleak tale of illegal abortion that powerfully affirms one's faith in people.
1	"First, this movie should be enjoyed. Later, marveled at. And then, once the excitement has faded, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days really should be studied, because director Cristian Mungiu creates scenes unlike any ever filmed."
1	Features impressive performances by the three main characters and powerful naturalistic cinematography.
1	There's fascination in these still little dramas that feel more like voyeurism than cinema.
1	"This is a beautiful film about ugly circumstances, set in 1987 near the end of the Ceausescu era in communist Romania."
1	"The absolute clarity of the storytelling, the aching authenticity of the performances make for a film that will stay with you for at least as long as the period alluded to in its title. It might stay with you forever."
1	"The film emerges as a devastating personal drama, a suspenseful horror story and a powerful statement about life under a repressive regime."
1	A powerful film and a stark visual accomplishment.
1	"Observes with ruthless, artful precision. While plunging a knife through your soul."
1	"Cristian Mungiu's masterful chronicle is impressive above all for the way it respects the audience, expecting them to follow the implications of its multifaceted tale without always spelling them out."
1	Grippingly horrible.
1	"[A] brilliant, suspenseful, absolutely riveting film."
1	
1	An engagingly breezy tale about a guy with a broken heart and the girl who broke it.
0	"There's no real drama when the inner life of the female lead is so shrouded, even if that's the point."
1	Conventional? Not at all.
1	I can't speak highly enough about this really inventive romantic comedy.
1	[Director] Webb treats his characters and his audience with respect. The result is something worth savoring regardless of the season in which it is seen.
1	It's a Gen-Y Annie Hall made by a new-style Wes Anderson who uses his cleverness for humanity instead of postmodern superiority.
0	Scratch any cynic and you'll find a romantic; scratch this movie's surface and you'll discover a typically tepid ode to pitter-pattering hearts dressed up in thrift-store chic and faux-edginess.
1	"What is unexpected is the sincerity beneath the modest conceit that, yup, love hurts."
1	"Thanks to two wonderful, offbeat performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, this movie has charm to spare. It looks you right in the eye and tells the truth."
0	"For all its ambitiousness, (500) Days of Summer feels synthetic and derivative, a movie that's popping with perceptions while searching for a style."
1	This is a film that so respects love -- if it exists -- that it won't settle for imitations.
1	A fresh July breeze among recent (and mostly stale) romantic-comedy offerings.
1	"If only some sharp-eyed script editor had run 500 Days through the de-sappifying machine, it could have been the first great romantic comedy of 2009."
1	"The ending is tidy and way too cute, but (500) Days is otherwise a different kind of love story: an honest one that takes a piece out of you."
1	"Even if (500) Days of Summer isn't truly great, it is great fun, from its fresh view of Los Angeles to its use of music to its charming leads."
1	"The movie charmed me enough to send me out smiling, and I can see younger filmgoers taking it very much to heart."
1	"It goes down smoothly, thanks in large part to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's grounded lead performance and Marc Webb's slick direction, but it seems like every other scene coughs up a dispiriting clich."
1	The writing is often clever and the overall production playful and intelligent.
1	"Boy gets girl and boy loses girl in convoluted, sometimes cloying but ultimately winning fashion in 500 Days of Summer."
1	"In romance, we believe what we want to believe. That's the reason 500 Days of Summer is so appealing."
1	"What saves 500 Days from terminal shallowness are Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel, who are not the usual picture-perfect androids peopling these young-love idylls."
1	(500) Days of Summer is something seldom seen: an original romantic comedy.
1	A romantic comedy that feels like real life.
1	"It's the oldest bittersweet story in the book, of course, but music-video director Marc Webb approaches his feature debut with great confidence, flair and a minimum of schmaltz."
0	"I guess maybe I'm not Tom but Summer. I like your looks, and heaven knows I appreciate the energy you put into wooing me, but I don't want us to be a couple."
1	"The film gets by on a few funny lines...some playful split-screen imagery from first-time feature film director Marc Webb...and the real star of the picture, second-billed: Zooey Deschanel."
0	"The movie suffers at times from a surfeit of adorableness in its two leads, as well as clumsy voiceover narration and a general sense that the subsidiary characters have about as much edge as +h toys."
1	"Everything that's wrong, on the surface, with (500) Days of Summer pales in light of everything that's going on beneath its surface."
1	An irresistible feel-good movie about love gone bad. And that really isn't bad at all.
1	This sweetly engaging trifle goes down as easy as cold lemonade on a hot afternoon.
1	"Much like Annie Hall did for a previous generation, (500) Days of Summer may be the movie that best captures a contemporary romantic sensibility."
1	"It's a tale you've heard a million times before. But it's told in such a relatable, inventive way in 500 Days of Summer, it almost feels like the first time."
1	"Finally, a romance that understands we mark our lives by our scrapes with love, and our defeats, rather than simply white-wedding-cake success."
1	
1	Falling in love or falling out? This film offers a helpful tonic for either condition.
1	"The swooningly romantic comedy (500) Days of Summer is a movie that will be discovered, embraced and shared with friends like a favorite record album."
1	This is movie magic most unexpected.
1	"[A] visually witty, flawlessly played romantic comedy."
1	"This movie has flighty warmth. It makes delirious use of one of Hall & Oates' boppiest tunes. It has a bluebird of happiness, for crying out loud."
1	"Captures with such immediacy the elation and anxiety of new love, the tingle and the terror, the profound sense that you have never been more alive and the occasional wish that you could die on the spot."
1	"It isn't Hugh and Andie or Meg and whomever, but (500) Days offers hope that Hollywood can pass that romance baton to somebody other than the crude crew of the Kappa Alpha Apatow frat house."
1	This is a romantic comedy that makes the concept of romantic comedies appealing again -- that reminds you how resonant and transporting they can be when they're done right.
1	"If it just misses being this generation's 'Annie Hall', it's still deliciously refreshing, sweet and fizzy. A sherbet dip of a movie."
1	It is hardly the freshest romantic comedy of the past 20 years. Taking the best bits from other movies and rearranging them in a non-linear sequence does not make for an original film.
0	"Despite clever moments and Hornbyesque touches of melancholy, it's let down by sitcom cliches, and by being weirdly incurious about the inner life of its female lead."
1	"An ideal version of this film would be painful and playful, and a good deal less cluttered. But the one we get certainly has delightful moments. After any exposure to this year's unfailingly smelly mainstream romcoms, it's a breeze."
1	"(500) Days of Summer is a great film - a step in genre and gender development that will be referenced for years to come. And aside from all that, it's really good fun."
1	(500) Days of Summer is an above average rom-com that dares to venture towards an appalling conclusion.
0	"I've read somewhere that (500) Days of Summer is being called the Annie Hall de nos jours; that's a slur on a great movie, not to say on nos jours."
1	Comparisons with Woody Allen are misplaced - the lines don't punch the way Woody's used to - but the cinematography does a good job of making unfashionable corners of Los Angeles look like Allen's Manhattan.
1	It's very smooth and well done; Marc Webb clearly has a solid visual eye and natural sense of pacing.
1	"An unpredictable, immensely satisfying experience, much like love itself."
0	"Forcedly cute, clumsily mechanical, overdetermined, and undernourished, this ostensibly soulful romance is a plastic void."
0	"The principals perform their roles nicely, but there really isn't much for them to do. Undoubtedly, the age gap has influenced my negative response."
1	"Even hardened cynics will embrace the clich -- yep, you will laugh, you will cry."
1	"Reiser has written his characters with an indelible sweetness and vulnerability, which allows the cast to deliver performances with some depth."
1	"Will Reiser's semiautobiographical script initially prescribes too artificial a story treatment for its characters but is rescued by a genial, low-key vibe that builds in sensitivity and emotion up through the final reels."
1	"There's a vital difference between, say, the trumped-up day-seizing of The Bucket List and this, a funny, moving, well-grounded take on a potentially traumatic experience."
1	What a tightrope this movie is.
1	50/50 mostly succeeds as a movie about a young man fighting cancer that doesn't give in to sap or sentiment.
1	"Builds to the confidently sincere movie you hoped it would be, after dithering around in tired cutesiness."
1	...delivers some hard-core truths as well as therapeutic humor while treating more than one kind of death.
1	Levine has accomplished a tricky bit of juggling here: He's made a film about cancer that's effortlessly affecting.
1	"A small winner; the director, Jonathan Levine (""The Wackness""), has a great touch, mordant but light-handed."
1	"It's the Rogen-Goldberg touch, with the duo's characteristic Superbad mash of the sweet and the bracingly coarse, that sells this unusual downer/upper of a life-and-death comedy."
1	"""50/50"" is a tremendous movie. It's also a really funny one, which doesn't mean it won't make you cry."
0	"My reaction to everything that happens in 50/50 was ""Why don't they just walk out?"" But nobody did, so I did it for them."
1	"Too much humor and we lose the characters. Too little humor and it becomes a Lifetime Movie. Balance is the key and, for the most part, Levine finds it."
1	"Odds are you'll find something of substance, a few life lessons in between the laughs in ""50/50."""
1	"50/50 nimbly draws humor out of a young man's illness, walks a tightrope of tragicomedy and touches on all the right points."
1	"""50/50"" will be liked and appreciated even by people who can't imagine wanting to see it."
1	"I admire the audacity of the script, which was written by Will Reiser from personal experience, and I laughed in most of the right places, as people in Adam's life struggle, often absurdly, to say or do the right thing."
1	"Emotionally honest even when it's going for big laughs and filled with lived-in visual detail, it's raunchy and touching without ever being crude or mawkish, a small, sharp comic jewel with a big heart."
0	"Neither the actor nor the filmmakers can get under Adam's skin, despite all the close-ups and the moodily shot scenes filled with the kind of movie silence that feels more like the groping of an uncertain screenwriter than of a man facing his mortality."
1	"""50/50"" deftly blends tragedy with comedy - in a way that feels, often effortlessly, like real life."
1	"Too pat and contrived to be the Oscar bell-ringer early reports have claimed, ""50/50'' is most affecting when it shows callow young dudes struggling to come to terms with the ultimate party crasher."
1	"As a comedy about a young man with cancer, it needs to be serious enough to be real as well as light enough to be funny. Though it falls off the wagon at times, it maintains its balance remarkably well."
1	"Levitt, the definition of nuance, is touching, funny, and fierce - an unusual combination of moods, but deeply affecting."
0	"To the extent that 50/50 works, it because of Gordon-Levitt, one of my favorite actors."
1	"This nervy film avoids being blatantly ""life-affirming"" or ""feel-good,"" helping it earn its tears and laughs. The premise covers the first of those. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen merge it with the second."
1	"Refusing to hide from pain or bow to it, 50/50 makes its own rules. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen are a dream team."
1	"The fear, anger, and despair of terminal illness barely pierce the movie's easygoing vibe, which becomes something of a problem in the second half, but for the most part this is fresh, sincere, and inquisitive."
1	"50/50 is crude and funny, and it demands that you laugh. And you will."
1	"A funny, thoughtful film, less about surviving cancer than about the agonizing process of growing up."
1	"A picture with a commercial sensibility and a quippy streak, yet one honest enough to transcend the usual."
1	"Although ""50/50"" is structured with the efficiency of a sitcom, there's an undercurrent of truth and real feeling."
1	"Still, it's Gordon-Levitt's choices that continue to impress. Sure, he owned one of the most jaw-dropping sequences in last summer's blockbuster Inception. But the actor remains drawn to profoundly human-scale hurts and quiet triumphs."
1	Gordon-Levitt is an agreeably undemonstrative actor who plays well opposite the burbly Rogen.
1	Chances are about 90/10 that you'll enjoy 50/50.
0	"Scene by scene, 50/50 can be both amusing and moving, with the tightly wound Gordon-Levitt and the boundaryless Rogen forming an oddly complementary pair. But as a whole the movie never quite coheres."
1	"In other hands, Adam might well be hard to take. But as the comedy in 50/50 turns darker, Gordon-Levitt, who's maybe the most natural, least affected actor of his generation, makes prickly plenty engaging."
1	"An everyman tale with plenty of heart and honesty, the serious subject matter is regularly enlivened with jolts of genuine hilarity, some of it in delightfully questionable taste."
1	"What ensues is ""Beaches"" meets ""Pineapple Express."" Which, I've got to tell you, is pretty much what living with cancer is like."
1	"It wrings comedy from cancer and surrounds its saintly protagonist with sickly stereotypes. But the closer it gets to the mortal abyss, the more it feels real and revealing."
0	"The truly outrageous idea, that you can use being gravely ill to get sympathy hookups for yourself and your friends - as underlined in the movie's original, better title, ""I'm With Cancer"" - is given short shrift."
1	"It succeeds mostly thanks to stellar work by the wonderful Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who capably handles the dramatic heavy lifting, and Seth Rogen, who delivers big laughs as his raunchy bud."
1	"""50/50"" takes the hackneyed convention of illness-driven melodrama and reinvigorates it with honesty, clear-eyed compassion and unsentimental wit."
1	"""50/50"" is a low-key, authentic, warm-hearted film; the cast is one of the best of the year."
1	Add 50/50 to your want to see list. And then make an appointment for your annual physical with your doctor.
1	"There couldn't be a more serious subject, yet Gordon-Levitt and especially Rogen (who co-produced the movie) make the comedy seem both spontaneous and organic."
1	50/50 is about right.
1	"It's not a major landmark on anybody's rsum, but it's nothing to be ashamed of either."
1	"This frequently funny and moving film proves humour can be wrung from tricky subjects, providing it's done with sufficient thoughtfulness and wit."
0	This film leaves a strange taste in the mouth.
1	So well-meaning you want to hug it.
1	A rom-com with brains that - at key moments - feels as sly and sweet as Annie Hall.
1	The stars have a goo-goo chemistry that's hard to resist.
1	50 First Dates is more of a romantic comedy than an Adam Sandler comedy.
0	About 25 too many.
1	Great date-movie material if you can keep your date from bolting during the first half.
0	"The film could have made a solid Saturday Night Live skit, but the closest it gets is serving as a reunion for onetime cast members."
0	50 First Dates is working awfully hard to be romantic and not hard enough to be a comedy.
1	"What starts out looking like another crude, bullying Adam Sandler extravaganza ends up as a surprisingly graceful and impressively daring romantic comedy."
0	50 First Dates has nothing going for it -- and much going against it.
1	"Although its goofy high-concept premise won't bear much scrutiny, it offers a less predictable ride than their first pairing, and lush Hawaiian locations to boot."
0	A drab Groundhog Day retread.
1	"50 First Dates is the perfect date movie, one that should appeal to teens into Sandler's mean-spirited shtick, while drawing coos and oohs from those traditionalists drawn to something softer and dreamier."
1	"I don't think 50 First Dates is a great movie, or a particularly funny one, but I admired its romanticism and its gentle plea for the acceptance of difference."
1	Sticky but ingratiating.
0	"This pedestrian pic starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore never gets out of neutral, and should have been left in park -- back in the junkyard."
0	"Sandler's movies always have combined juvenile humor with sentimentality, but the two rarely have seemed so out of synch."
1	Pushes all the right buttons and pushes them expertly.
1	"A chick flick for guys, with a pH balance in perfect equilibrium between the crass and the sweet."
0	"50 First Dates possesses an undeniable heart. The bad news is that it will still be buried underneath layers of stale Sandlerisms tomorrow, and the next day, and the next."
0	Vast majority of the humor is so grotesquely obvious and crudely presented (in addition to being mildly crude in and of itself) that Sandler dissenters are guaranteed to remain just where they are.
0	"If there's one thing to commend in 50 First Dates, apart from the finest walrus performances this side of Marineland, it's Barrymore, whose irrepressible cheerfulness and buoyancy at least makes Henry's motivation anything but mysterious."
1	50 First Dates stays bravely true to its unresolvable premise.
0	An awkward blend of date movie and preadolescent comedy.
0	"The jokes in 50 First Dates aren't jokes, and the bits aren't bits so much as scattershot gestures in the general direction of comedy, at which an audience is expected to laugh, not at the joke, but at the comic's attempt at humor."
0	"Uneven, shapeless and crushingly repetitive."
1	Surprisingly sweet.
1	"50 First Dates is reasonably good fluff, balancing lovey sentiment and low-brow laughs, though it will likely evaporate from memory as quickly as Lucy forgets her meetings with Henry."
1	A terrible movie by all reasonable standards -- yet it leaves a sweet taste.
0	"The film moves in fits and starts, never finding its groove: It's as if the filmmakers could come up with a potentially successful premise but no way of following through."
0	"Crude, lewd and shameless? You bet."
0	The only people likely to be disappointed will be those who bother to wonder how good 50 First Dates could have been.
0	"Much of this is very sweet, even touching, but it just isn't funny."
0	It may leave women sighing and men wondering why there wasn't at least one more joke about the prodigious endowments of sea lions.
1	50 First Dates offers a seductive vision of a quirky love. But there is a note of melancholy at the conclusion of this mixed bag of the compassionate and the crude.
1	"The movie doesn't have the complexity and depth of Groundhog Day, but as entertainment it's ingratiating and lovable."
1	"50 First Dates wants to have it both ways, but only one of them really works."
1	"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore shine in this sweet, flirty comedy about a man who falls for a woman with short-term memory loss."
0	This movie paints itself into a corner from which it cannot emerge without becoming an utter disaster as far as I'm concerned.
0	Ends up making you pine for Lucy's gift of forgetting.
0	"Stupid, coarse and abysmally unfunny."
1	"The spark between the stars and a surprisingly thoughtful screenplay ensures that, despite the odd gross-out misstep, this is a sweet, warm and funny romantic comedy."
0	Quite what age group this soft-centered entertainment is aimed at is hard to divine.
0	"The true-life horse-racing tale ""50 to 1"" takes forever to get galloping - and when it finally does, it's too little too late."
0	"If ""50 to 1"" were about 15 minutes shorter, all of this might have made for a passable diversion. As it is, ""50 to 1,"" much like Mine That Bird, flags before reaching the finish line."
1	"In some ways, an antidote to the sugarcoated myths and lies the movies have taught us about love and marriage."
1	"Doug Block's 51 Birch Street proves that the simplest, most ordinary stories can also be the most spellbinding."
1	A tonal triumph of true-life storytelling told with equal measures of tension and redemption.
1	"Doug Block's very moving, honest and even suspenseful autopsy of his parents' marriage is the kind of film audiences leave the theater talking about, and which keeps them talking days later."
1	"In 51 Birch Street, a moving and fascinating documentary, Doug Block investigates the lingering, buried frustration in his parents otherwise ordinary lives."
1	"The resulting documentary begins shakily, with a naked self-consciousness that can be off-putting, but quickly develops into an absorbing and ever deepening drama."
1	"What makes 51 Birch Street a moving revelation rather than a therapeutic exercise is Block's commitment to understanding his parents, Mike and Mina, on their own terms, regardless of what it does to his image of them."
1	The intimate history of Doug Block's parents becomes fodder for a broader look at family secrets in this complex documentary.
1	"A warm and honest portrait of a marriage at its most mysterious, and ordinary."
1	The film has a compelling way about it. All five of the immediate Block family members emerge in full and affecting portraits.
1	A resounding success because it touches on things every child has wondered about on the road to adulthood.
0	"Ultimately, the film reveals more about Block than about his private, remote mother and father."
1	"Through haunting home movies, Mina's diaries and interviews with Mike, a raw, riveting portrait emerges of what a child sees in his parents' relationship and what lies beneath."
1	"The film grows in power as it goes, finding ever more universal levels of feeling."
1	"It gradually turns into a vivid demonstration that truth can be stronger than fiction, and that compromise is necessary in any lasting relationship."
1	
1	Unfolds like an epistolary psychological mystery. Little about or in this movie is as simple as it seems.
1	Demonstrates a willingness to experiment that bodes well for future endeavors.
0	"Why does the film fall so flat? Partly it's the fatally tasteful indie aesthetic, evident in everything from Benjamin Speed's ambient score to Bryan Mason's digital cinematography, which aims for ''muted'' and ends up at ''drab''."
1	"It's slow going at times but there's a nice balance to it and in the bravado Billie adopts as she attempts to find a way into the future, there's something both poignant and strangely gallant. Better still, she's ""authentic""."
1	The sensitively observed drama is distinguished by its structurally adventurous approach and the intimacy of its storytelling.
1	"Grippingly plotted and exquisitely thoughtful, 52 Tuesdays is a poignant reminder that neither confusion nor crisis is doomed to be calamitous."
1	A frustratingly fragmented yet warmly intimate portrait of an evolving bond that frays but doesn't sever.
1	Brings deft emotional nuance to the seemingly inexhaustibly complex relationship between individual identity and family ties.
1	Formally playful and thematically complex.
1	One can't but fail to be impressed with the film's commitment to investigate its issues with subtlety and frankness.
1	"What seems to be a queer issue film morphs into a rich thematic brew depicting how family, sexuality and time are all bound up in defining one another."
1	Rough around the edges but sophisticated where it counts.
0	A disappointingly dull film.
0	This is so dull!
0	"Except for Myers, and for many he will make the movie worth watching. He's absolutely shagadelic and completely unexpected. This should have been his movie."
0	"You see garbage bags filled with cash, a lot of avid cocaine snorting and fleeting glimpses of Warhol and Truman Capote, but it all feels ho-hum."
0	Mecca of cool turns out lukewarm.
0	Silly and clumsily made.
0	The trite story is a letdown because it traverses a predictable arc.
0	"The movie is flat, logy, and amateurish -- a Scotch - tape- and - balsa - wood job."
0	The party never gets started.
1	"54 is an entertaining and surprisingly serious look at the infamous New York discotheque, with a genuine nostalgia for the late '70s and early '80s, tempered by a healthy dose of jaundice - but without a sense of condescension or superiority."
0	"Decadence has rarely looked so pathetic, lethargic and dispiriting as it does in this listless film."
0	"It's a flat, clumsy piece of filmmaking."
0	The triteness comes thick and fast.
0	"Myers exploits every vicious, self-hating line that comes his way."
0	A more critical and resonant Hollywood movie about the glorious disco culture screams to be made.
0	"Scene by scene you wish 55 Steps made you angrier than it does. Yet August's docile filmmaking acts as an emotional soporific, removing even the potential camp pleasures of Bonham Carter's histrionics."
0	Fails to elicit memorable work from any of its principal collaborators.
0	"The wild-haired Carter has the flashier role and, although she digs into it with gusto, she's all over the emotional map."
1	"Somehow, these two difficult people are easy to watch, at least on the screen. They are honest to a fault, which is, in the end, their charm."
1	"More than ever in this seventh edition, the Up people seem to be fulfilling Henry David Thoreau's observation that ""most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."""
1	An intimate portrait of settling down and finally making peace with one's well-publicized past.
1	"As pop anthropology, the series is unchallenged."
1	"Self-contained enough for theatrical auds new to the series, it will play best with those who've come to care for these Brits over time."
1	[The film will be] of interest to faithful followers and easily accessible to newcomers.
1	These are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space.
1	"It offers a few insights, and fascinating updates on the most compelling characters."
1	"It shows that life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. And how, in case we forget, every age can predict the next."
1	"A rich portrait of how individual lives progress, and how age shapes expectations and experience."
1	"What gives the series its force is not just its universality but also its particularity. These grown-ups may be Everyman, but they are also singular."
1	"""56 Up"" is a rather bittersweet chapter, as age begins to further narrow those possibilities already defined at birth. And it hints that ""63 Up,"" if we get there, may be sadder still."
1	"'56 Up"" is as good a point as any to get hooked on the magnificent half-century series of documentaries ..."
1	"The effect is often profoundly moving, but you can't help but feel at times like there are other stories here you're missing."
1	"""56 Up"" reminds us that change is ceaseless and often dramatic, bringing growth we could never have dreamed of as little kids."
1	"Apted creates a graceful back-and-forth from the earlier films to the present, and the experience of seeing people who have lived so much on screen is quite profound."
1	"To see ""56 Up"" is to be reunited with an old friend."
1	"Inevitably, one looks in the mirror afterward and thinks, What have I lost? What have I gained? And at what cost?"
1	"We are all older now, and this series proves it in a most deeply moving way."
1	"Apted, himself now in his early 70s, says he hopes to continue the series further. Long may it live."
1	"Time has been neither kind nor cruel to the 13 men and women profiled in ""56 UP."" It has just been time, which is what this groundbreaking series is about."
1	"We feel good, refreshed and depressed in watching these people get older, also embarrassed in moments and cautioned about the passage of time."
1	"Apted skillfully weaves old footage with the new, and we become poignantly aware of another factor shaping their lives (and our own): biology, as the we watch the once-cute kids grow gray and heavy."
1	"What ultimately is so compelling about 56 Up is the universality of the experiences. We were all once children. And we all will die. And in between, there is everything else."
1	"Yes, on some level it's just a seven-year check-in with people maybe half-remembered, if that. Yet the films also serve as a kind of check-in with us, too."
0	This suffers as well from the fact that the subjects' lives haven't changed all that much since 49 Up (2005); perhaps the series will improve yet as they head into old age.
1	The original documentary was intended to illustrate how the country's deeply ingrained class system inscribed itself on the aspirations and inner lives of its young people. But the successive movies have been far less polemical.
1	"We're now at 56 Up,, and with each passing calendar leap, the experience of watching has only become more soul-stirring."
1	Doc finds an affecting personal angle on West Bank territorial dispute.
0	"Unlike the more sophisticated chronicle of resistance Burma VJ, it pays scant attention to the larger political context or, indeed, the strategies and tactics of protest in an age that offers sophisticated means of media management."
1	"Troublesome, worthy."
1	"""5 Broken Cameras"" provides a grim reminder - just in case you needed one - of the bitter intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
1	"Startlingly intimate and direct, this first-person doc by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi requires multiple viewings for anyone eager to work out how it could have been shot with such precision and visual ingenuity under such plainly chaotic conditions."
1	It offers a look at how a tireless protest can sometimes only come at the expense of one's own daily existence.
1	"The issues are complex and not easily solved. But no matter which side you are on, you'll be moved by this intimate work."
1	[It] makes no pretense at balance - it's unambiguously pro-Palestinian - but it offers a unique and intimate record.
1	"Israeli filmmaker Guy Davidi helps shape all of the footage into a compelling and very personal documentary, helping to craft the eloquent commentary in Burnat's voice that knits it all together."
1	What we do see has an immediacy and intimacy that's involving. It also can feel a bit wayward and cumulatively wearying.
1	"Both a moving first-person essay and an artful exercise in political advocacy, 5 Broken Cameras is about the experience of West Bank protests from the inside."
1	"Takes the rough material of one man's life and transforms it into a story that is universal and urgent, offering firsthand witness to events that are too often portrayed as distant and impossible to understand."
1	"[A] bit jagged, inevitably incomplete, and in no way news-breaking: it is simply moving."
1	"As raw as the material of ""5 Broken Cameras"" can be, it is also lyrical and elegiac."
1	A tough watch that'll leave you despairing of peace anytime soon.
1	"It is of course a one-sided film, but a powerful personal testimony: the kind of material that never makes the nightly news."
1	Each broken camera records a human tragedy as it flickers with its last gaze.
0	"Burnat's first-person footage of skirmishes with Israeli forces, filmed over five years on the titular damaged equipment, should have been allowed to tell its own story."
1	A fascinating reminder of why the humble video camera can be used as a weapon against political oppression.
1	This is how the conflict looks from the other side of the barrier.
0	
0	Five posh First World War sprogs are despatched to Uncle Kenneth Branagh's Gothic pile in a Devon nook. It's a ghastly film
0	"Had it rejected the genre's romantic trappings and false heroics more consistently, the movie might've been worth the ride."
0	Renny Harlin used to make ridiculous movies involving pirates or Sylvester Stallone; now he makes ridiculous movies about Putin's 2008 invasion of the country of Georgia.
0	A hell-on-earth thriller that makes valiant gestures toward geopolitical savvy but gets bushwhacked by vet helmer Renny Harlin's weakness for the Rambo-esque.
1	"The low-budget movie, set during Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia, is neither innovative nor profound, but it is kinetic, visceral and sometimes moving."
1	Whether its passion is faked or real is impossible to tell because it is expressed with such pulp-fiction gusto.
0	"As propaganda, 5 Days Of War is unlikely to make a mark, though perhaps the idea of reaching people through would-be blockbusters will."
0	"Harlin's roots show throughout the picture, as he films real-life horrors with a bombast better suited to summer entertainment."
0	Embarrassingly clumsy.
0	Should appeal more to those who like to watch stuff blow up than understand exactly why the carnage is transpiring.
0	Flimsy dramatization of Russia/Georgia conflict fails both as historical re-enactment and as action-flick thrill ride.
0	"Harlin's film begins with the familiar adage that truth is the first casualty of war. Usually that phrase precedes an attempt to revive the patient, not bury it deeper in the rubble of propaganda."
0	"The plot is culled from a variety of ""war is hell but I'm covering it anyway"" journalist-in-the-field movies but handled with clichd clumsiness in a script by David Battle and doctored by Finnish writer Mikko Alanne."
0	An action movie scarcely deeper than a Michael Bay extravaganza.
1	"Keaton and Freeman's chemistry goes a long way toward selling this trifle, and whatever it may lack in drama, it is refreshing to see a happy golden-years marriage depicted with such affection onscreen."
0	"What starts as a somewhat charming - if prosaic - story of love in the time of gentrification inexplicably spends most of its third act mired in the finer points of apartment hunting, like a tastefully lit HGTV show."
1	It's good to see first-rate artists devoted to a film that doesn't pander to an unsophisticated audience with a thirst for violence and smut.
0	"Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman are pleasantly entertaining in ""5 Flights Up."" But the movie's far too pleasant for far too long."
1	"What a pleasure to see a simple, finely tuned dramedy about real adults with real emotions in a real-life situation."
1	"The movie ends just as you expected it to end, and there are almost no surprises along the way."
1	"Based on Jill Ciment's wry novel Heroic Measures, the film is at its best when it sticks with the everyday ..."
1	The lead performances are so perfectly in sync that Alex and Ruth really feel like an old married couple who know each other's foibles and cherish every tic.
1	"5 Flights Up is a sweet film with a few nicely turned lines, some good jokes, and some very lovely dialogue. But it's not much more than fluff and air."
0	The duo provide a bit of wit and warmth amid the contrived subplots and the self-satisfied moralism.
1	Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton have unexpectedly great chemistry in this warm and funny comedy about a couple who contemplate leaving a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn they've occupied for their entire 40-year marriage.
1	"""5 Flights Up"" is far from perfect, but it's also undeniably touching."
1	"If 5 Flights Up is worth seeing, it's primarily for the pleasure of Keaton and Freeman's company, + maybe for some tips on buying and selling an apartment."
1	"A couple of pros, playing attractive characters in an amiable yet topical story."
1	"Sometimes you see a play and you can imagine it being a movie. Sometimes you see a small movie like this, and you can imagine it working better as an intimate stage play."
0	What begins as a sweetly sentimental story ends up being cloyingly melodramatic.
0	"If you're looking for a film completely free of loud explosions, raised voices or anything actually happening, you can't go wrong with this fusty New York fairytale."
0	Even Freeman at his twinkliest and Keaton at her most kooky and adorable are not enough to sweeten the bad taste left by Ruth & Alex.
0	Ruth & Alex is a drama without drama: the cinematic equivalent of a barbiturate. Freeman and Keaton deserve better material.
0	"As storytelling, 5 Flights Up is remarkably clumsy: the narrative strands never knit together, the well-intentioned messages are awkwardly spelt out, and the stakes remain low. That said, it's an easy film to watch."
1	Sumptuous and romantic in an attractively old-fashioned way despite a hitch designed to give some contemporary American idealists pause... the film satisfies in a wholly commercial way.
1	"Courageously sentimental in an age of irony, Victor Levin's refreshingly articulate ""5 to 7"" delivers romance of the sort thought lost since the days of Audrey Hepburn, for those who appreciate such finery."
0	"Though it's understandable that the melancholy Arielle is moved by Brian's passion for her, the contrasts between them always makes her seem like more of a babysitter than a paramour."
1	"Nothing turns out the way you expect it. Everyone has an F.A.O. Schwarz gift box full of surprises before 5 to 7 smoothly sails into its final sunset over the Manhattan skyline, and so will you."
1	"Levin's rendering of a literary and ever-surprising New York touches Woody Allen levels, even as he slyly shifts the tone from near-farcical to elegiac, with references to Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim."""
1	It's the type of thing only [a film] with an accent can get away with.
1	"Although Mr. Levin tends to embrace clichs and overstatement ... he can also surprise you with delicate touches, a pained look, a wince of recognition."
0	It's as much a triumph of boyish wish fulfillment as Peter Parker swinging on skyscrapers.
0	"While the film has an undeniably sexy glow, it's too earnest and sappy by half."
0	"There must have been pretty slim pickings at the Neil Simon store by the time ""5 to 7"" writer-director Victor Levin got there."
0	"Its central relationship has a sitcom-ish superficiality, heavy on light banter and lacking in any real passion."
0	"Somewhere before the halfway point the movie crosses a line, and its fantasy version of New York, not to mention of French women, gets to looking kind of hoary and inadvertently adolescent."
1	"""5 to 7"" is an interesting directing debut that, like Brian, shows promise."
0	"Levin, in an effort to appease an American sensibility, has taken sophisticated subject matter and made a movie for children."
0	"For an R-rated romance about a young writer's affair with a sultry French siren, ""5 to 7"" generates all the heat of an Easy-Bake Oven. It aims to sizzle but quickly fizzles."
1	It expresses a belief in love as something miraculous and transformational. It says that love makes people what they are and provides the experiences that reverberate for a lifetime.
0	"The Brian-and-Arielle story never quite feels believable; it plays more like a novel than a genuine love story, like a work in progress, rather than a beginning and, inevitably, an end."
1	"Though Yelchin does not elevate his role much above pasty callowness, Marlohe brings to hers a luminous irony and melancholy that makes her the ideal elusive beauty of hyper-romantic adolescent dreams."
1	"The problem with 5 to 7 is that the most important romance, between Brian and Arielle, never feels real."
0	"There aren't many surprises in ""5 to 7,"" unless you count such startlingly cliched bits of dialogue as ""Life is a collection of moments"" and ""There's no free lunch."""
1	"The strong cast, a beautiful score, and a surprisingly affecting ending make it more convincing that it seems at first."
1	"The fairytale aura is nourished by outdated yet timeless notions of Frenchness and Americanness, grand romantic fantasies in themselves."
1	"It's conventional, occasionally maudlin docmaking that nonetheless grips the heart exactly when it needs to."
1	"A moving study in courage and compassion, albeit with some heavy-handed touches."
1	The frequent sight of someone in his or her 60s or 70s juxtaposed with that of the same person 35 years ago is time-machine startling - and time-machine effective.
1	"""5B"" is ultimately about survival, and the struggle at its center is undeniably a heartbreaking one."
1	This is an aspect of San Francisco cultural history and American medical history that deserves to be known.
1	"""5B"" proves as inspiring as it does unsettling with its heroic stories of the hospital staffers and allies who fought ignorance, fear, bigotry and political wrangling to protect the rights and integrity of AIDS patients."
1	Its simplicity is in service of its effectiveness.
1	"Ripstein allows events to unfold in a meandering low-key style, employing an observational point-of-view with a handheld camera."
1	"Ripstein allows long stretches to go by in near-silence, gradually letting the tension build as the SUV travels farther south, deeper into potentially dangerous territory."
0	"600 Miles doesn't generate the level of nail-biting suspense one expects here, languishing in lengthy driving scenes and other bits of mundane storytelling."
1	"Maybe you had to have been there to really appreciate 61*. On the other hand, 61* might just make you feel as if you were."
1	"While the script has its fair share of treacly moments intended to manipulate viewers into caring deeply for this duo, Billy Crystal's dream project about his beloved Yankees and one of their great chapters gets a heroic treatment in 61*."
1	"Barry Pepper is an amazing Maris look-alike, Thomas Jane manages to suggest the damage Mantle did to himself, and Richard Masur plays the sort of sportswriter I wanted to grow up to be..."
0	"What begins as a lively, vibrant evocation of one of baseball's greatest seasons ends as a frustratingly conventional tale of sports heroism, a sort of upscale movie-of-the-week for the Classic Sports Network crowd."
1	"This film is about more than a broken record. It's about a broken heart. Watch it, and yours may break, too."
1	"The beauty of 61, the Billy Crystal film for HBO, is that it early on makes a few dangerous missteps and corrects them quickly, all the while benefiting from a story as riveting and freshly modern as any sports story ever."
1	"Mr. Jane, as Mantle, nails both the player's movie-star charisma and his painful, self-destructive streak."
1	"The largest grace note is the core of the film: that's the affection and bond between Mantle and Maris, men so different in temperament, so similar in culture."
1	"Featured here are Barry Pepper as Maris and Thomas Jane as Mantle, actors as persuasive on the field as off."
1	"The triumph here is one of tone and texture, where the baseball and the emotions are almost always depicted just right."
1	The filmmakers depict the teammates' relationship with a gratifying complexity -- they're both competitive and protective of each other.
1	"Not everyone will enjoy this slide down a narrative garbage chute lined with thorns. But viewers and programmers with a taste for midnight-movie outrageousness will cotton to its mix of sleaze, quease and bad-taste absurdism."
1	"A film which clearly and desperately aspires for cult status, 68 Kill will undoubtedly have its fans, but they won't be people you'll want to have over for dinner."
1	"Those who pick through every motion picture searching for the ""problematic"" will want to steer clear of ""68 Kill."" But fans of wicked women may have a new cult favorite."
0	"Nearly a de facto remake of After Hours, writer-director Trent Haaga's lively trailer-park thriller 68 Kill keeps the hostility and loses the self-deprecation, which turns it into an example of misogyny rather than an examination of it."
1	"Nuttier than a bakery full of fruitcakes and sleazier than a cheap strip club, ""68 Kill"" is a proudly morbid heist movie that wallows in bad taste and still comes off as absurdly funny."
0	The kind of piece that needs to move 100MPH from first scene to last for you to overlook its flaws. It slows down for too long to recommend the ride.
1	"It's cheap and trashy and tasteless, but it's not unfun, and there's a pleasing measure of low-budget craft on display."
1	"A heartfelt, scary drama about what addiction does to the people around the addict."
1	"What stays with you is [Abbi] Jacobson's grippingly understated lead turn, which promises a fruitful future screen life beyond Broad City."
1	The movie leaves you with a deep respect for the willingness evidenced by Ryan and her collaborators to take several gambles that pay off dramatically and emotionally.
1	"At just over 70 minutes, Balloons feels more like a sketch or a character study than a fully realized film, but it's an affecting sketch nonetheless."
1	It's a compliment to first-time feature writer-director Marja-Lewis Ryan that we want more of what she has to offer.
1	"At just over an hour, it feels worthy of expansion, but as a short, sharp reminder of the sprawling horror of addiction, it makes its point with a stinging sadness."
0	"Much like its frazzled protagonist, 6 Balloons has a strong sense of direction, but the film is too constricted to let go, embrace the detours, and allow life to takes it course."
1	It will be a miracle if you stay awake.
0	"It manages to hit the appropriate beats of this snowbound survival tale (digs ice shelters, scares off wolves, drinks meltwater) while also being incredibly dull."
0	"""6 Below"" ultimately can't rise above the swelling inspirational score or the flat adaptation by Madison Turner, which mechanically pivots between the mountaintop and flashbacks from LeMarque's dysfunctional past."
0	6 Below suffers from a charisma deficit.
0	"Stylistically, it's strictly made-for-TV trauma-drama stuff, but it's hard not to admire Hartnett's tenacity in what was surely a physically challenging role and wonder why he hasn't had a better career arc."
0	Facing death while trudging through a frozen wilderness turns out to be remarkably unexciting in this fact-based drama.
0	"As with the latest Kate Hudson comedy, it's a formula for irrelevancy pretty much as a rule."
0	An ostensible romantic comedy that's really just a grating portrait of an irredeemable jerk.
0	"Imagine Tucker Max - the charm and you've got . . . well, Tucker Max, but also Blayne Weaver, the star-writer-director of the indie rom-com ""6 Month Rule."""
1	Funny and fresh.
0	Weaver's last ditch attempt to upend rom-com convention and rewrite the movie as a skeevy lout's comeuppance hardly makes up for the clichd slog that comes before.
0	A muddled and dramatically inert thriller about a psychiatric patient who plays host to a veritable flash mob of multiple personalities.
0	Is it a psychological thriller or a giddy horror of the evil-in-them-there-hills persuasion? This split-personality number can't quite decide.
0	"As far as its own multiple personalities go, Shelter gives you your pick of exhausting, grim and absurd."
0	"Unfortunately, no one here is especially sympathetic, and the shock both parents seem to feel on discovering their kid is a grade-A brat is hard to believe, given the general sense of verisimilitude."
0	"The end credits, which seem almost as long as the movie itself, dementedly thank everyone from the citizens of Pennsylvania to William Wyler, Howard Hawks and God. What an insult."
0	"Ultimately, the silly material overwhelms the style ..."
0	What unholy spirit could have possessed Julianne Moore when she signed on for the sort of throwaway horror flick that would normally star unknowns and go straight to DVD?
0	Psychology-themed horror tale goes a little nutty in the end.
0	"Beginning as a psychiatric freak show, ""6 Souls"" eventually trades serial-killer intimations for backwoods bad mojo before becoming just another dimly lighted pop-up-stalker flick."
0	A preposterous supernatural thriller that inexplicably managed to sign up Julianne Moore to star.
0	"""6 Souls"" is regrettably sick with that familiar disease afflicting movies of this ilk: ostentatious, hollow moodiness that spreads like an unwelcome rash."
1	6 Underground... is a riotous and gleefully delirious assault on the senses. It is vulgar. It is absurd. And it is completely enthralling.
0	6 Underground proves so uneven in its tone and unrelenting in its volume that it's hard to imagine a hole deep enough in which to bury its silliness.
0	"It becomes repetitive, nonsensical, and just loud after everyone gets an origin story and we're left with nothing to do but go boom."
0	"It wouldn't be a Michael Bay movie if he didn't slavishly cater to the lowest common denominator (get ready for some sexist and gay-panic jokes!), so it makes sense that Bay's antiheroes are more obnoxious when they're trying to be good."
0	"""6 Underground,"" a non-stop stunt reel with a few, admittedly impressive displays of your usual visual verve -- is just ""Fast & Furious"" crossed with an old Whitesnake music video, but with fewer functioning brain cells."
0	Reynolds should have stopped going underground after 'Buried.'
1	"It's pure Bay, through and through."
1	"If you can get past the imbecilic script, there's no question that Bay has seized the opportunity to make ""6 Underground"" as visually stunning as such a project can withstand."
0	"What he seems to be chasing is the feeling of freedom, the windswept open-skies exhilaration of a man who has everything. But he's still just doing donuts, hoping all those whiplash turns from nihilism to macho sentiment awaken something inside him."
0	"After a strong start the movie steadily declines, one set piece after another, and there are many moments where the mind wanders and then asks: ""Is this still going on?"""
1	It's an entertainingly goofy and excessive folly from Bay.
1	"There are genuinely eccentric innovations here. There's certainly not a whole lot of recognizable humanity, but hey, that's why there's ""It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."""
0	Guns. Ferraris. Parkour. Headshots. Mlanie Laurent. Las Vegas. Luxury yachts. Thong underwear. Incoherence. Xenophobia. Sexism. Auteurism (Vulgar). 'Merica.
1	"The madman director's Netflix debut ""6 Underground"" is so big it feels like it's going to smash out of your television screen."
0	"It's a film that lets its audience gorge on violence and bravado, only to make us feel sick of the taste by the final reel."
0	This is a terrible action movie that utilizes Michael Bay's worst instincts and none of his best.
0	"The film becomes a cascading-failure scenario that proceeds from Soumah's intention to bait-and-switch the audience, coupled with a lot of suboptimal acting and amateurish editing choices."
0	"It's like ""Memento,"" except that movie was fantastic."
0	"[6 Years] too often veers toward melodramatic overstatement, inspiring little empathy or understanding despite the committed performances of promising young leads Taissa Farmiga and Ben Rosenfield."
0	A melodrama benefitting from excellent performances but suffering from a too-obvious script.
1	[The two leads'] heartbreaking performances imbue this familiar Austin-set narrative with a fiery edge.
1	It's Ratanaruang's stylish direction that recommends the movie.
1	It is a lot of fun and allows us to track the growth of a special artist.
1	"Enlivens some dingy genre predicaments (dirty money, corpse disposal) with gusts of dreamlike whimsy and a sardonic take on local economic woes."
1	Thai director Pen-ek Ratanaruang's splatter comedy 6ixtynin9 rejoices in a plot as tricky as its spelling.
1	"This is confident, fascinating filmmaking."
1	"The film's mix of hard-nosed realist drama with more heightened genre elements - action, certainly; horror, even - means that it's always distinctive and has you in its grip from start to finish."
1	"Stumbles at the last, but this is strong work from Demange."
1	"This is a taut thriller, with great control of action and pace, and an outstanding re-creation of the west Belfast war zone."
1	"In revisiting the Troubles, what this film finds is a wasteland of shattered trust, and the only objective it comprehends is getting out alive."
1	'71 brings a fresh perspective and a piercing urgency to a well-worn scenario.
1	"Yann Demange's brilliant debut feature is an honourable companion piece to Carol Reed's 1947 classic, Odd Man Out."
1	"'71 hurtles along, visceral and daring."
1	"The Troubles have rarely been more troubling onscreen than they are in '71, a vivid, shivery survival thriller that turns the red-brick residential streets of Belfast into a war zone of unconscionable peril."
1	"A big part of [Demange's] achievement resides in the casting of such a veteran crew of character actors in the first place, but credit is due for coaxing such subtle performances."
1	"When the action slows down just enough for dialogue that extends beyond gruff, hollered exchanges, Gregory Burke's brilliantly economical screenplay doesn't mince words."
1	"Yann Demange tints the midnight alleys of Belfast like an Irish flag dragged through the mud: black skies, sickly green lamps, and the orange flames of torched cars."
1	"A tense thriller from Britain that so adroitly joins physical intensity, emotional authenticity and political acuity that you may find yourself forgetting to take a breath."
1	"Mr. O'Connell runs away with "" '71,"" in which his character's every emotional, psychological and physical hurdle makes for kinetic cinema."
1	"'71 may not illuminate all that much, but it consistently electrifies."
1	"A private in the British army finds himself stranded on the streets of Belfast in 1971. Demange's film, spiked by an all-stops-out O'Connell, makes politics unnervingly personal."
1	"Big-screen storytelling stripped to its dramatic and visual essentials, and the result is nothing less than shattering."
1	"'71 rarely stops for breath; the threat of sudden violence hangs over every mundane conversation, and Demange expertly sustains the tension, allowing anxiety to build, briefly ebb, and then build again, over and over."
1	"Within its limited compass, '71 packs a punch, and the lack of political bias does give it a more encompassing feel."
1	"'71 doesn't always work, but when it does, it's a blistering, gripping tale of a boy lost in a war gone horribly wrong."
1	"O'Connell continues to bring equal measures of toughness and vulnerability to his characters. Despite his good looks, there's an everyman's quality to him, which he uses to full effect in ""'71."""
1	"It's a riveting, man-on-the-run genre movie, almost a combination of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""After Hours,"" rather than an allegory or a historical treatise."
1	Such is the plot's momentum ... that we scarcely notice the jolts of implausibility.
1	"It's only March, but this could be 2015's most invigorating directorial debut."
1	"Gripping, mournful, suspenseful."
1	"The movie excites, but intelligently, without stoking blood lust or Old Testament revenge impulses."
0	"If you are in the mood for a confusing and thoroughly depressing immersion into Irish history, you can't do better. But that would be a very odd mood to be in."
1	"When it comes to vengeance and murderous intrigue, the Belfast in ""??71"" is a small world."
1	O'Connell is terrific.
1	"This isn't a story about religious differences. It's a thriller - gripping, almost abstract and carefully assembled by filmmakers who appear to know more about creating tension than explaining it."
1	"It may not be fair to call Yann Demange a great filmmaker after just one feature, but that feature, '71, just might be a great film."
1	"Scenes take on a surreal nightmare quality, sometimes with no accompanying sound, as even the camera seems dazed by what it is witnessing."
1	"The grainy, grimy, shadow-strewn look is right for this sort of military noir, and the women who haunt the edges of the conflict are splendid icons of both conscience and crushed humanity."
1	"Shot by first-time feature director Yann Demange on the gritty streets of Sheffield and Liverpool in a style that puts the viewer in the crosshairs of the action, '71 is bracing from beginning to end."
1	"This is a brisk, frightening movie about recent history and it's well worth a look."
1	"It's a potent, visceral experience, but it doesn't offer much historical context, and its depiction of the IRA is fairly simplistic."
1	"The film doesn't take sides, but shows how conflict stirs the pot of human emotions and how quickly things can get out of control. And it shows that in war, no one is right."
1	Demange's feature debut miraculously distills the often Byzantine nature of the power politics behind The Troubles in a deeply intimate chamber piece about a single day in the life of a British soldier.
1	"People died, but it's more than the bombs, bullets and bodies. The more fascinating damage was done to psyches and souls, and Demange, with '71, comes for yours."
1	"For those who know nothing of this bitter conflict, the movie is a good start."
0	'71 makes so much effort to be suspenseful that it doesn't have much time to get into nuance.
1	An impressive debut feature buoyed by a captivating central turn.
1	"The film's Endsville, when we reach it, is almost an anticlimax, thanks to the masterfully orchestrated ensemble acting and the countless dramatic mini-explosions unleashed along the way."
1	Michael Hanekes 1994 feature is an icy-cool study of violence both mediated and horribly real.
1	"A resourceful, if rather hyperbolic documentary that devotes 90 minutes to analyzing one of the most famous scenes in film history."
1	"For a long time now, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" has been two movies, and the hypnotic film-geek documentary ""78/52"" is an ingenious and irreverent master class in both of them."
1	"The film picks up when it gets down to shot-by-shot analysis, allowing editors and other interviewees to break down one of the most famous sequences in movie history."
1	"For all the pointy-headed geekery and technical expertise on display, 78/52 never loses sight of the fact that the Psycho scene is so important because it works so damn well, even now."
1	"Director Alexandre O. Philippe unpacks an entire semester's worth of cinema studies, coming to a unified theory of how one act of on-screen murder became the perfect ""image of the uncaring universe."""
0	"It ... seems overly breezy and insufficiently detailed, just skimming the surface."
1	"It's a screen moment to treat with total reverence - and so enduring it could sustain ""78/52: Part 2."""
1	Alexandre O. Philippe's close reading of the Psycho shower scene is as refreshingly fun and perceptive as his documentary's name (referring to Alfred Hitchcock's 78 camera setups and 52 edits over three violent minutes) is eggheaded and clinical.
1	"Essential viewing, even if you have to watch through your fingers."
1	There are some interesting insights here - and a fair bit of redundant and derivative waffle ...
1	78/52 is an orgy for movie obsessives. It makes you see the familiar with fresh eyes.
1	"In providing a detailed analysis of the shower scene in Hitchcock's horror milestone, makes a persuasive case for Psycho as the film that jump-started modern cinema."
1	"Obsessive but accessible, the deepest dive imaginable into one of the most celebrated scenes in movie history, the documentary ""78/52"" looks at a brief three minutes of cinema the way it's never been looked at before."
0	A 30 minute film stretched to feature length.
1	"A documentary with wit, intelligence and negative-sum dull moments."
1	"78/52 is a fascinating affair, bound to appeal to movie lovers and social theorists alike even if it does sometimes seem more like a film studies lecture than a conventional piece of entertainment."
1	"The infamous shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gets taken apart, fabulously dissected, then reassembled for this expansive and essential Hollywood documentary named after the scene's 78 camera set-ups and 52 edits."
1	Hitchcock's shower scene may never leave the pop culture of fear it helped create.
1	Philippe's geekiness is infectious. His passion for film shines through most when he invites some of his interviewees-like horror nerd Elijah Wood and his friends-to watch the film on camera and comment on its foreshadowing and subtle motifs.
1	"The film surges by, powered by high spirits, well-plotted surprises, and the directors' admirable attention to both the real and romantic ..."
1	"""7 Boxes,"" a low-budget Paraguayan crime caper goosed by low-rung dreams, crackles with the desperate energy of forced innovation."
1	"Certain to be one of the first titles from Paraguay to make a serious dent in the international marketplace, the pic makes a pleasurable sur+ from minimal resources and plenty of ironic-comic-violent storytelling energy."
1	"Paraguayan action-thriller-romance hybrid 7 Boxes is a rollicking good time at the movies that offers breathtaking action and suspense, humor and appealing characters all in one visually flashy package."
1	"Directed by the team of Juan Carlos Manegelia and Tana Schmbori, 7 Boxes also has the verve, vigor and vitality of the best low-budget debuts; watching it, I felt the same vibe I did from Reservoir Dogs or El Mariachi or Primer."
1	"Directors Juan Carlos Maneglia and Tana Schembori weave together a complex, fast-moving intrigue with little more at their disposal than a few cell phones and the byzantine corridors of the market."
1	"What jumps out here is the pervasive desperation shared by just about every character. Within the film's universe, people from all walks of life go to great lengths for money."
1	"Shot in an expedient cellphone-aesthetic visual style, sometimes with the camera planted at the front end of Victor's pushcart in dizzying motion, the movie manages quick-and-dirty introductions to all the major players in an increasingly bloody game."
1	"""7 Boxes"" is both a tense and frightening crime film as well as a sometimes-dreamy evocation of life in the sprawling underclass, its hallucinatory aspects, its chaos and violence, its fantasies."
1	"A fun, relentless thriller set in the mean streets of Paraguay."
1	"There's no subtlety here - coincidences are wildly abundant - but with this kind of vitality, who cares? Sit back and be carried away by the extended tracking shots and bam-bam editing."
1	High-energy chase pic makes the most of a novel setting.
1	"This is good, escapist stuff."
1	[Jason Schwartzman] smarms his way through Bob Byington's very funny 7 Chinese Brothers as if the pic had been drawn up especially for him.
1	"Like its primary character, 7 Chinese Brothers is charming but can't always figure out what it wants to be."
0	"""Quirky"" alone isn't enough."
0	"7 Chinese Brothers is a go-nowhere shrug of a movie, the kind of indie that might send you screaming for the multiplex."
1	"Call it quirky or observational or shaggy, but almost everything works."
1	"Feels like an homage to the early work of Wes Anderson with its plinky soundtrack, solipsistic banter and emphasis on uniforms."
1	"Schwartzman is great at making Harry both sharply intelligent and not nearly as clever as he thinks he is. You also sense, in some lost look in his eye, a faint realization that life is passing him by."
1	"Considering how aimless its screenplay, how lost its hero and how unglamorous its setting, Bob Byington's ""7 Chinese Brothers"" is remarkably appealing."
0	"There's absolutely nothing novel about a ""loser gets it together"" arc ... But for those who just want to see Schwartzman be Schwartzman for an hour or so, 7 Chinese Brothers delivers the goods."
1	"You've seen this movie before in different guises. Byington does seem to have a vision of life, though, which is more than you can say for most comedy directors working at this budget level."
1	The sharpest moments cast mundane struggles in a nearly spiritual light.
0	7 Chinese Brothers is so slight it risks evaporating on contact.
0	"The film never allows the audience to truly get to know any of the characters in Larry's world, a world in which their uniform shirts emblazoned with company logos and their first names serve as reminders of their lot in life."
1	"By widening his soulful puppy eyes - matched only, quite eerily, by those of his French bulldog in real life, Arrow - Schwartzman successfully dares audiences to care."
1	Schwartzman ... gives Larry enough humanity and a modicum of personal growth that you keep coming back for more.
0	"Writer-director Bob Byington showed potential as a social satirist with his provocative 2008 indie RSO (Registered Sex Offender), but this slacker comedy lacks any such venom."
0	"""Surprise and speed is the key,"" someone comments at one point; the only surprise is how unspeedy and unsurprising this project turned out to be."
0	One listless week.
1	"Director Jos Padilha's task was simple: find something new to say about the 1970s most famous air rescue. To that end, he ably succeeds at his goal, even if the project itself never quite soars."
0	"We're left right where we started, and with nothing to show for it but a fleeting reminder that peace is impossible without negotiation. It's a lesson that history has failed to teach us, filtered through a movie that doesn't understand why."
0	The hijacking of an Air France passenger jet on a flight from Tel Aviv to Paris in June 1967 has been celebrated and cross-examined in documentaries as well as left to Charles Bronson to resolve in a 1976 action film. Did we really need another version?
0	It's strong stuff. And then it all goes down the drain.
0	"The dialogue errs on the side of the didactically obvious: ""You are here because you hate your country. I am here because I love mine."""
0	The end result is likely to leave viewers scratching their heads. What the ...?
0	"The British actress Rosamund Pike, alas, is a disaster as Kuhlmann."
0	The film ... gestures toward relevance without finding a coherent historical or political point of view.
0	"Never terrible, nor never more than dramatically adequate."
0	A serviceable thriller that might have been something more.
0	This is a political thriller that's woefully short on thrills.
0	Even a tight timeline can't keep the movie on track.
0	"In the end, it's a reasonably well done film with no compelling purpose."
1	"The dance's themes of conformity and deviation resonate powerfully with the movie's true theme, which questions whether Israel's robotic stance of non-negotiation has been effective, in the long run."
0	"After a good start, even the reliable Daniel Brhl and Rosamund Pike quickly are reduced to standing around looking grim and, frankly, a little bored."
1	"It may still be light years away from a masterpiece like Steven Spielberg's Munich, but it has an urgent tick-tock suspense that's hard to deny."
1	poignant and powerful
0	It doesn't quite hit its target in providing an emotional resonance or political relevance for today.
0	"Give the filmmakers credit, they had an idea for something no one had ever done before. What they didn't realize is that there was a reason for this: The idea was horrible."
0	This feels no more riveting than watching people watch one of the previous tellings of the story.
0	"Padilha is trying something noble here: to give every side its due. Unfortunately, he gives us a lesson in moral complexity instead of a movie."
1	The film is absorbing enough in its own terms but ends up caught in a no man's land between character-based political drama and explosive action-adventure.
0	How do you tell a thrice-told story a fourth time and keep it fresh? Possibly you don't and can't.
0	The film's determination to remain politically even-handed robs much of the drama of any sense of urgency or purpose.
0	"Like the hijacking itself, you can't help feeling it was all for nothing."
0	It's a film which stays glumly on the tarmac.
0	"The most discernible terror comes not from the hostages huddled in the terminal, who are little more than extras, but from the sense of a director too paralysed by the fear of causing offence to take a perspective."
0	"Portuguese action director Jos Padilha (Elite Squad) generates a hurtling momentum, especially as the raid takes shape, but his dialogue scenes are indifferently staged."
0	So generic and perfunctory in nature that it's difficult to become involved or stay immersed in the action.
1	"Its opening [has] perhaps the greatest dream scene of all: Marcello Mastroianni's Guido stifled in a silent traffic jam, onlookers gazing blankly at him as he rises through the sunroof of his car, high into the sky. The rest of the film isn't too shabby."
1	8 1/2 is the best film ever made about filmmaking.
1	"The ensuing decades have brought forth a deluge of bogus masterpieces, and Fellini's, by comparison, holds up rather well."
1	"Somehow, the movie is more than the dated crisis of a naval-contemplating artist. It's about the inability in all of us to make sense of our lives, put it all together and come up with something meaningful."
1	"[Fellini] is that rare sort of artist who can be loved, revered and just barely tolerated, all at the same time."
1	he effect is sometimes confusing -- but always beautiful -- and eventually intertwines to a singular life-confirming realisation that cuts through the madness and embraces it.
1	"Here is a piece of entertainment that will really make you sit up straight and think, a movie endowed with the challenge of a fascinating intellectual game."
1	"Amiably spiking all criticism through a gloomy scriptwriter mouthpiece, Fellini pulls a multitude of rabbits out of the showman's hat."
1	It's Fellini's last black-and-white picture and conceivably the most gorgeous and inventive thing he ever did.
1	"Here is the author-director picture par excellence, an exciting, stimulating, monumental creation."
0	"Unless Fellini's problem has been preying on the mind of the viewer, he may not care to take on the director's doubts and confusions."
1	"8 1/2 is probably the most potent movie about film-making, within which fantasy and reality are mixed without obfuscation, and there's a tough argument that belies Fellini's usual felicitous flaccidity."
1	In terms of execution I cannot remember a more brilliant film.
1	Marcello Mastroianni becomes an avatar for the great Italian director Federico Fellini in the surreal cinematic self-interrogation that takes place in 8 1/2.
1	It exerts an irresistible pull.
1	A carnival of the soul.
1	"Fellini keeps a grasp on his difficult form, creating some penetrating, witty, tragic moments."
1	"Cowan strikes a potent balance between heart and head, juxtaposing emotionally wrenching moments with self-damning portraits of Mormon politicians and church officials, and hard-nosed journalism from reporter Fred Karger."
0	"The filmmakers fail to settle on one approach, so the disparate parts of this far-too-short feature (it's barely a Dateline special) cancel one another out."
0	It seems impossible that anyone will have their minds changed or even piqued by watching this film. No one will really listen to The Mormon Proposition because we've heard it all before.
0	It's so one-sided you hardly care after a while that the side it's on is so clearly the right one.
0	Cowan and Greenstreet are preaching to the choir.
0	The movie is shrill even by advocacy-doc standards.
1	"The highly emotional documentary is narrated by Dustin Lance Black, the screenwriter for Milk, who, like Mr. Cowan, is gay and grew up in a Mormon household."
1	"Instead of stooping to the level of Focus on the Family's misleading Prop. 8 ads, the pic damns the LDS Church not with lies, but with their own words."
1	"Combining investigative reporting with personal experience, Reed Cowan's impassioned documentary is unlikely to leave many dry eyes among its audience."
1	"A compelling look at how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operates in the political arena, even if audiences come away knowing that writer-producer-director Reed Cowan has told the story from his biased point of view."
1	A hard-hitting expos of a shameful episode.
1	"As an expos, there could hardly be a stronger case for ensuring and strengthening the separation of church and state -- or a stronger message to gay people as to the magnitude of the challenge to win equal rights."
1	"No matter what your stand is on gay marriage, you're bound to come out with a broader definition of family values."
1	An impassioned piece of timely agitprop.
0	"There is a message here of the necessity for tolerance, but 8: The Mormon Proposition would have been better had its makers presented it in a more consistent, artful fashion."
1	[Cowan] expands his sad and furious homegrown film to record the misery of gay Mormons sometimes driven to suicide over being rejected by their church and families.
0	It's marred by loaded language and a propagandistic tone that undercuts rather than promotes its purposes.
1	Provocative and disturbing.
1	"Everything you ever wanted to know - or perhaps never knew you wanted to know - about the wildly influential Roland TR-808 drum machine is laid out with entertaining, if exhaustive, brio in the documentary ""808."""
0	"84 Charing Cross Road is a movie made for people who love London and books. The only problem is that the heroine doesn't get to London until it's too late, and nobody ever seems to read in this movie."
0	"The result of this high-powered collaboration is a movie of such unrelieved genteelness that it makes one long to head for Schrafft's for a double-gin martini, straight up, and a stack of cinnamon toast from which the crusts have been removed."
1	"The film has nothing to do with easy nostalgia; it's about real, credible people, and as such finally becomes very moving."
0	The picture easily snatches from Revolution the prize as Al Pacino's career worst.
0	Pacino and company mark time in this preposterous copycat killer thriller.
0	"A stronger word than preposterous is needed to describe the, well, preposterous lengths director Jon Avnet and company go to engorge this movie with idiotic action, incomprehensible twists and loads of other nonsense."
0	It's always a shock when a movie turns out to be this bad.
1	88 Minutes will add a little more luster to a career that has not been adequately appreciated perhaps because of the suspiciously seductive power of a little man with an outsize talent.
0	Why is Al Pacino in 88 Minutes?
0	"It takes eight minutes, tops, to know that even by the conventionally lax standards of watch-and-toss serial-killer movies, 88 Minutes is a stinker, the more so for the thespian excesses of the accomplished cast."
0	"If you lower your expectations and keep a sense of humor, even that large popcorn will seem worth the money."
0	"The preposterous ""88 Minutes"" is a serial killer movie starring Al Pacino's festival of hair."
0	"This movie is Battlefield Earth bad. It's 10,000 B.C. bad. It's bad with a side of fries and a cherry cola."
0	"Not merely Pacino's over-mannered, near-histrionic performance, but the movie itself could be characterized as busy, busy, busy. It's so full of plot twists and revelations and exploding sports cars that its very perkiness comes to seem comic."
0	"An inane thriller whose major fear factor hinges on a menacing phone call, the film also relies on a silly phrase intended to fill the viewer with unspeakable terror: 'Tick tock, Doc.'"
0	"The only enjoyable elements to this film are Pacino's impressively hardworking hair (no matter how bad Jack Gramm's day gets, his exuberant hair looks fabulous)."
0	Too bad the sober tone only makes for a movie that pretends at seriousness but that can't really be taken seriously.
0	"Although it's often laugh-out-loud laughably bad, 88 Minutes is mostly just a slog."
0	Avnet lays all this stuff out before us with a straight face -- the picture is humorless and witless.
0	"Try as he might to 'hoo-ha' some life into this stupendously stupid thriller, Al Pacino can't disguise the desperation of this CSI wanna-be."
0	"A maddeningly mediocre, ineptly manipulative 'real-time' thriller. (A real-time thriller that's almost 20 minutes longer than its title suggests.)"
0	Markedly un-thrilling.
0	"When the doubting-cop character in a movie like this asks the hero 'Do you have any idea how absurd that sounds?' -- well, he's really voicing the screenwriter's own darkest fears."
0	"88 Minutes holds you in a state of acute suspense, keeping you wondering until the very last minute whether this is the worst Al Pacino movie ever made."
0	"This slimy, slug-minded mystery thriller starts out dead on arrival and then, like three-day-old fish, gets really bad really fast. And it stays bad, ensnaring its star and every other cast member in its wretched net."
0	"This is easily one of the silliest, most preposterous thrillers ever made, and the only reason it didn't go straight to video has to be that it stars Pacino."
0	"What a bore. I guessed the identity of the killer from the character's second appearance, and I'm not that smart."
0	This new serial-killer thriller is such a preposterous mess it's a wonder it ever made it to the theatre.
0	"Throughout which, you ask: Why is Al Pacino in this movie?... The better question: Why are you in the theater?"
0	Here's the thing about Pacino: He's often at his most entertaining when he's chewing the scenery.... Watching a great actor raise the roof is often more enjoyable than watching an OK actor deliver the goods.
0	The illogical script by Gary Scott Thompson is desperate to keep us guessing but clueless as to how. Every tin of red herring in the store gets ripped open.
0	"Nothing would give me keener pleasure than to reveal the identity of the killer, but a day after seeing the film I have genuinely forgotten."
0	It's quite possibly the worst movie of 2008 so far.
0	The galumphing serial-killer picture 88 Minutes is dumb enough to be straight out of the parodies in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
0	"If you like your women half-naked, strung upside-down from pulleys, and sliced like deli meat, this is the movie for you. Whether the victims are more tortured than the plot is a serious question."
0	"Interestingly, the more overblown and insincere a performance Pacino delivers in a film, the more self-important and bouffant his hair gets. Here, it's so towering it takes up 90 per cent of the screen."
0	"Now that this stupendously inept serial-killer flick has slithered into theaters, the diminutive legend had better clear room in his closet for another cinematic skeleton."

1	Writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson dig deep into the subculture to deliver a terrific movie.
1	Eminem is magnetic playing a version of himself.
1	Qualifies as a cinematic event by tapping into the roots of Eminem and the fury and feeling that inform his rap.
0	"O.K., so I'm the wrong audience for this teenage junk."
1	Gritty and electrifying.
1	"A movie that will satisfy hip-hop and Eminem fans in ways they never expected; even more significantly, it will touch people who thought they hated hip-hop and/or Eminem in ways they would have never expected."
1	The movie is a success on its own terms because the director doesn't condescend to pop music.
1	"8 Mile should satisfy Eminem's legion of fans and, at the same time, affirms rap's power as an artform, as real beat poetry, for the uninitiated -- and even for the actively resistant."
1	"A fascinating, surprisingly entertaining stand-off that has adroitly managed to satisfy both of its constituencies, allowing all sides to legitimately claim victory."
1	"The climactic 20 minutes or so represent the most electrifying depiction of rap that the multiplex is likely to see, a torrent of word-slinging packed with atmosphere and ribald drama."
1	"Set in Detroit's 8 Mile, the dividing line between the city limits and the northern suburbs, 8 Mile is an exciting, well-crafted movie, loaded with urban atmosphere."
0	"As music star movie debuts go, 8 Mile is hardly A Hard Days Night, but it's not Crossroads, either."
1	[Eminem] does a lot of things right. So does the movie.
0	"The payoff comes after an hour and a half of a long, criminally tiresome setup."
1	Eminem steals the picture from a cast with snap down to the smallest parts.
0	Underwhelming.
1	The triumph here is that Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have found a fresh way to tell this story.
