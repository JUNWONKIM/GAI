20280	"From the moment I pulled up after ordering literally had ZERO words spoken to me by the drive thru guy. He just gave me dirty looks. Then after taking my credit card he took his cell phone out looking like he was stealing my credit card information. I asked for my receipt which was given with a hateful look but still no words. I called MULTIPLE times and left multiple messages before I got a call back from a person stating they were the manager. They said they pulled the video and he was just texting no picture. He could be texting my credit card info. I still don't feel comfortable with this and my card is still frozen. Mcdonalds once they take my card is accepting responsibility for any fraud /theft and PCI DSS compliance. If their employee did in fact steal my CC I am filing criminal charges against the employee and McDonalds for not being PCI and PII compliant. The auditor in me will not allow this. Even if he truly is innocent, the perception with the influx of cyber crime should never happen. Do not have your cell phone out when holding someone's credit card."	1 star

20282	"I went in and ordered at a kiosk to go , I got a medium caramel frappe and a mcextreme bacon sandwich.
While waiting in line , I heard the kitchen staff say there is no sauce for the extreme, should we give it to them anyway? With no intentions of me hearing .
When my order came out, no one informed us there was no sauce , didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it , another sandwich or my money back ..
I told them I heard them and they denied it , then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich . But she didnt , (I could hear them) and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask ??
I also noticed there was 2 tomatoes instead of 3 that i paid extra for, same goes for the pickles I asked extra for .
I got a male employees attention and told him , hey this isn't correct...etc. he hot an attitude , rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously .
The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce , someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member.
She intervened, corrected my order . The only one who helped . She deserves a raise// a reward . Thank you .

P.s. the lobby is dirty . Take some time to clean the tables"	2 stars

So I said well hello.. first, and I would like a .. and proceeded with the order. No total was given but  was told ""move forward"". No please or thank you.

He arrived at this location and he went to give them the code and they said they could not fulfill my order since my phone was not at the restaurant! Absolutely preposterous service.

No attitude, no acting like she had better things to do, she treated me very well, even joked with me a bit because I wanted a shake but, the ice cream machine was down for cleaning. My order was correct and EXACTLY what I wanted and was done in a speedy manner given how busy they were. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't get my shake. LOL"	4 stars

After about 10 minutes asked if they were serving people inside and the manager told us yes to give them a second. She didn't even turn around and look at us.  Waited another 5 minutes and still never received any service.  By far the rudest manager I've encountered at McDonald's.	1 star

The grill chick looked at me after standing there a few mins.. I said excuse me.  She looked at me then turned around and hid behind a stainless Steele shelf for a min.

20308	Missing 1 large French Fries. Wrong honey mustard instead of sweet and sour (had to pay 10 cents per sauce packet. Very slow service. The slow service might be that more time is put into closing the bag with tape than it takes to prepare the food. The only reason they get any stars is because they were super polite.	2 stars
20309	"Sorry I like McDonald's, but this restaurant is not doing good. Customer service is pitiful the employees are rude and by the way they take your order I don't think they like what they are doing. Also need more manpower too many customers and a very long wait time. And then you get you order now it has to be to go and it does not come with catsup for the fries, 2 napkins fires half way full etc etc. I will think twice before I go back to that restaurant. I really like McDonald's but having those experiences I might stop eating big mac's, fish sandwich, fries, sweet rolls and many other things. If management gets to see my txt I hope next time that I try to go I will have a better experience."	3 stars
20310	"So I ordered from door dash.  All my French fries were missing and I have 5 children all the sundaes and McFlurrys were missing.  I called door dash and got credit for the missing items but as those of you know you don                           t get dash fee and delivery fee and tip credit when the items missing so I lost that money.  I reordered all the missing items which included 3 Oreo McFlurrys,2 fudge sundaes and one Carmel.  I received 2 sundae and 1 McFlurry.  Get door dash credit again but again loading the fees and tip.  I try and call the store so the manager could at least talk to the parties who were making and packing and checking the order and tell them just be careful and pack everything on the receipt. Just read it and check it. But no first 3 calls it rang a few times and went to message that this store can                           t answer calls anymore. It late it not rush hour at  care is taken to ensure the quality of the food they put out.  Very disappointed in this store.   "	1 star
20311	They need to hire real English speakers. It took me 10+ minutes to explain my order. Then my fries were so cold they must have prepared them last night. I had to go back inside and wait another 10 minutes to get them replaced. Meanwhile my burgers were getting cold. There were 2 Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby. The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard. I don't know if anyone else was English speakers or not but all I saw was 4-5 Mexicans working at noon. Photos included. Management or owners need to periodically check to see if their restaurant is to standards.	1 star
20312	"I've been there twice. My order was completely messed up both times. The first time they offered to make the missing burger and make fresh fries. I waited 20 min before I said, I want my food or my money now. I got my burger and the same fries she took from me 20 min ago. I watched them screw up order after order while spending time playing and flirting. Horrible place. Needs real management. Not management trying to get into their co workers pants."	2 stars

20314	"This is THE WORST MacDonald's I have ever visited. First thing I noticed. Four white customers standing in line and the black customers being served their meals. The BLACK manager custom made their sweet teas, reassured them that ""all you have to do is ask for me and I'll """"have your back"""". They left more than happy. Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting. When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist, the manager just looked at him and turned around. In response, that white customer left very angry before ordering. After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites, another white couple simply walked out without ordering. Finally I ordered my meal. A Big Mac meal. It took five minutes to expedite my meal. The black manager yelled out my number, dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left. No thank you, no reassurance that I was pleased, nothing. I then waited 10 MINUTES for my large Coke!!!!!!                                     The cashier, who is responsible for making drinks, didn't know how to get more ice or restock the large cups. To top"	1 star
20315	"THE WORST MCDONALD'S I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!!
I went there to order breakfast sandwiches for my crew to show them some appreciation for there hard work. I ordered 20 breakfast sandwiches to get to job location and count 15 only in the bags. I had to waste my time and gas to go back and get the rest for my crew.  They should really double check there orders before handing them out. Also they are rude and unprofessional!!! You tell them the situation and they look at you like it's your fault and dont even apologize for any inconvenience they have caused you. Someone from corporate really needs to go clean house at this location. As I am writing this I can also see all the other bad reviews about this location. That's gotta say a lot about the GM running this store and his employees.   "	1 star
20316	"It's unfortunate that after today,  I'll be going to the McDonald's on Beach. 3yrs here, 7 days a week I order a large mocha.   I've seen the management change about 7 people and I've made some friends.
All those people are gone. I made a direct complaint recently because I've had enough,  you'd think I'd go to a different McDonald's with ""that ""many issues right? Well, I don't think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service, but...its not changing. My complaint was handled fast and efficient. I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird, a couple of days ago. I came back and was asked to park in 3 for it to be re made. I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasn't satisfied with the drink, we both laughed and she said ok.
Yesterday, I waited an hr because it was raining crazy...for a doordash. They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder.
Today I go, and retrieve my mocha again, and the manager ask me how many were promised to me? I let her know,  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it,  it's taste burnt.  The gm says , I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha. To me...that is calling me a liar. Especially when you repeat it after I tell you ,I didn't come yesterday,  I doordashed and yall messed that up. I also have dash receipts to show.
She then says I didn't call you a liar, but I know I gave you a free one. She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering. No. Have you ever experienced that? I'm here daily! When I told her her staff isn't at the window, just as she wasn't when I pulled up*today*  she said something was wrong with the speaker...No, accept some accountability.  The last manager told me she was Rosa and that's not the same lady I complained on. Anywho,  I told her I'm not the problem and I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed yet,  but today I've decided to switch locations. lol drive further for good customer service, Rosa, thank you for at least responding today.

20324	"042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order, then she walked away with my credit card, the large cup had black finger prints marks on it, and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich. The hashbrown was also greasy!

I ordered a bacon McGriddle w/o cheese, hash brown and a senior coffee. She thanked me and stated my cost. When it wasn't aligned with normal cost, I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal. That reduced the price very nicely, but made me wonder why my server didn't at least offer to check the price to help me. Then, I decided if I'm paying for my cheese, I'll take it on the side. When I got my order, the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease! The sandwich was messier, sweet dough (yuk) and the hash brown soaked through the bag! I know McDonald's serves fast food, but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it! I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadn't eaten. The experience reminded me, they are not emergency food, they are emergency room food."	2 stars

Thanks for wasting my time. Ronald wouldn't not be happy, not happy at all!"	1 star
20326	"The manager himself throws fries inside the to go bag, maybe 10 in the container and the rest all loose in the bag. Has a salty attitude and highly unqualified position.

PS. The chicken nuggets taste like out-dated breaded shrimp."	1 star
20327	I ordered a bacon smokehouse meal. The lady asked chicken or patty. No where on menu did it say chicken. The only thing I received correct with my order was the drink. I ordered beef and I received the chicken only. I ordered the meal and didn't receive my fries. Then the receipt said sandwich only with chicken. Usually when you order its automatically a meal unless specified otherwise. I ordered the meal she heard everything I said cause she repeated it back to me. I will make my stops elsewhere.	1 star
20328	"I am only giving 1 star instead of 0 because the OTHER staff were great. I listened to the manager verbally abuse the staff & customers. The establishment was a disaster, including a gentleman with no shoes picking at his toes in the back booth. I feel sorry for anyone having to work under this manager. Even when he managed the courtesy to pull a employee to the back to ""speak"" to them, everyone was still able to hear the highly explosive conversation. l do however commend the other staff for holding it together although i did see one staff member crying while taking orders after a ""conversation"" with said manager. I pray UPPER MANAGEMENT reads this review and does something about this situation ASAP. This is the worst review i have ever had to write and hope to never have to write such a review again."	1 star

20331	The self check out are down and apparently they dont serve lunch till 1100 on Saturday. This whole experience even with the pilot that shares its location was bad. I did call ahead but i got no answer from the pilot. Their showers and laundry is down they're doin construction but the truck parking lot is kinda tight. If a mom and poped open a truck stop around here id give them business. Also this mcdomalds doesnt have indoor dine in due to covid. If you want to be comfortable and sit in a restaurant and eat come to my home state of fl amd get real southern hospitality. We dont live in fear in fl. I didnt think texas had well i leave it at that. They could at least clean the sitting area even though it has caution tape and looms like a crime scene. A little broom and a mop would make a world of difference but the dust that has accumulated out yhere could give a person a cold. Companies really need to start rethinking this covid kick. With resent events people are going to become more conservative with their money. Oils is about to go up and energy pretty muck controls the market.

She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk? And started going off on me about manners, by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work, as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause I'm black?

I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt ""yes, I heard you"". Guess what , not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke.  Well at least the fries were right.

McDeath has a great app,"	2 stars
20393	"I usually don't lower myself to Micky D's food, but I was here and hungry, so figured one burger from here wouldn't kill me. As long as your expectations aren't too high, the food is okay, just sad though what Micky D's and Burger King and the others have done to the Great American Hamburger. If you look around you can get better food and service. The only burgers worse than Micky Ds are the soy burgers you get out of vending machines. And as long as you don't ask for anything special, they'll make you a burger, but I asked for one without onions and catsup, and naturally they couldn't even get that right. A crappy burger with crappy service, what a wonderful meal.. BTW, if you want to find The Great American Hamburger, as it should be, go to Fuddruckers."	3 stars
20394	"Ridiculously slow!!!! It is 12:40 a.m. and I have been here 15 minutes. Since I have been here I have watched the manager open the register I was standing at, then walk back to the office and then come back out to make herself a frappe and then walk back to the office.

You order on screens instead of with a person, and the system still feels like it's in a beta mode.  On the bright side, you can get booze next door while you wait."	1 star

I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there. It literally had no top hamburger bun, and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a ""quarter hamburger"" was. When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn't even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands. I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun, not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude. I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons. But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up (no gloves) and slap an undercooked bun on it, and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about ""what's missing here?"". It wasn't even busy in the drive thru or the dining room. I can't pretend to know their job or lives, but I hope they aren't this effed up to every PAYING customer. I ended up asking for a refund, and not taking the burger, even this was an issue. Please beware!! I only regret not getting their names to report them. Again, not trying to be  a drama queen but I worked hard to afford this little splurge to get this slap in the face."	1 star

And their fries were hot, fresh, crisp, & salty , just the way I like them. Fyi-there's limited parking in front facing LV Boulevard but in the back there are a lot of spaces."	5 stars
21122	I ordered an egg muffin at 5:30 AM.  I was expecting a fresh one.  The bread was overly chewy so for some reason I opened it up and looked inside.   There were dark clumps of matter in which I can only presume was dead chicken fetus.	1 star

21133	"The automated kiosks are horrible.
This store is supposed to be fully automated.. but that's probably the reason why it just doesn't work.   McDonalds should really look into the process and solve it. The workers are at the mercy of inferior technology.

I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the kiosks.

There are some that aren't working.. some that are working.  A customer instructs me not to use the one I'm facing because it's broken.  Instead.. I use the one on the other side.

The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and cumbersome.  I have a coupon which I wanted to use.  I first add the item.. then scan the coupon.. VOILA... double order.  Okay.. my bad for not understanding the system.  So now I have to remove the item... I add another item.. and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says ""Is this all I want?""

So I add some more things and finalize my order.  I try to check out, but I have no way to edit my order to select to go.  Okay.. no big deal.. I'll just choose a table... and VOILA.. ERROR.. Please see a cashier.

I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up front.

During this time.. I see and here about 3-4 people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up (really.. it's this automated system that doesn't work... not the people.)

McNuggets were okay.  They were warm.. but were on the verge of being dry.
Fries were okay... looked like they were out for awhile.. (and they didn't fill it to the top).
Soda... this was good.

I felt bad for the workers here since it seems the biggest issue is problems with the kiosks and how orders are sent over to workers."	2 stars
21134	"First time visiting this McDonald's location. The staff was nice, the food was good. Service was fine for a fast food place. Nothing phenomenal or out of the ordinary to report.

21135	"This Macdonalds fell short on a good quality customer service, their staff was very rude to us and a few other customers on our day of visit, they messed up on our order and we ended up eating 30 mins apart to my wife, I was so disappointed. Place was clean and you had to ask for a key to go into the restrooms, we were in Vegas for vacations and we stayed at m                  ndalay so this was the closest one to us, the 3rd day we wanted Macdonalds again and we decided to drive 15 mins "	2 stars

21137	One of the thing i regret doing is not looking at reviews. Went through the drive thru at 1 am. No one was in line. Food was horrible. Some fries were soaked in grease and were cold stale.

That wouldn't be a problem except I didn't get much more.  Then, they didn't fill my cup of orange juice.  It was just a bit more than 3/4 full.  Otherwise, it was very tasty!"	3 stars

21230	"Two girls at the window were very rude to us and our kids. They asked us to pull around the building but usually if there's no one behind us we say ""we'd like to wait here please"" We know it's all about their timer and restarting it so they say ""look at how fast we got them out""  usually when there's no other car behind us other fast food places say ok but one of the girls at the window kept yelling at us to move. Go to a different one."	1 star
21231	"Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but I'm absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant.
And filth is what I experienced at this McDonald's.
The staff who waited on us was nice, accommodating, and quick, and the food adequate; but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere. Reason being, there as no place to throw them away.
So, I am advising you to avoid this McDonald's!"	2 stars
21232	"They forgot my apple slices, but still charged me. we literally only ordered 8 hashbrowns 3 soft drinks and my apples... it was not a hard order at all. And I didn't notice till we got back to our hotel, because you know you can't eat indoors or even outside."	2 stars

21236	Who thinks of reviewing a fast food place?  Well if you receive outstanding service from a teenager working hard then the establishment and all the employees deserve a 5-star rating. Not only did the employee flawlessly do his job. He took the time to observe my car while in the drive thru to tell me my tire was going flat. We all know that could have been disastrous had I kept going. Great job!	5 stars

She could have easily made it right but failed to do so. I will no longer visit this McDonalds and I urge others to avoid it like the plague. There are plenty of other fast food restaurants in the area that are worth visiting."	2 stars
21239	"Lovely staff and amazingly quick service for my big order. Impressive quality and great nuggets with sizzling hot fries. The place is big enough and very clean.

We told her we had been there before 1030. She says sorry I can                           t sell breakfast to you and then says we can talk to the manager. Pulled up to talk to the manager she was rude and said they ran out of breakfast. At 1028 we said ok we were at the menu at 1025. She then said I don                           t know what to tell you we ran out of breakfast. Shut the window on us. We were going to order lunch but she didn  	1 star

21252	"For 6am, the staff was pleasant, the service was fast, & I even used the self ordering kiosk.l Where it's at, there is no lack of homeless & panhandling, so if you need the restroom, an employee will let you in, and don't be surprised if it is below standards, or seeing someone sleeping at a booth. On a brighter note... The line at the drive-thru window moves swiftly, and there is a bus stop along the sidewalk, for the North bound Las Vegas Strip bus."	4 stars
21253	Clearly said I wanted a drink but the cashier did not ring it up. When I asked about my drink they kindly gave me one for free regardless. Great service but normally has a line since it's the south strip spot.	3 stars

21255	"This was one of the worst McDonald's that I've ever been to. I went to the one on Warm Springs and Las Vegas Blvd, the customer service was excellent, they greeted us and made us feel like they cared. We Sked for no onions, we got just that. Our fries were fresh and hot. We wanted more and our tea was watery as we has already started down the Blvd, we went to the next McDonald's that we saw. We ordered fries and a double cheeseburger with no onions. We pulled up to the pay window and asked if we could trade the sweet tea and showed our receipt, the lady told us to ask at the next window, we pay and pull forward. The next person says no we dont do that, I asked for a supv, she explained to me that the other was a franchise and they are corporate. I accepted that. My fries were stale and my burger has onions. I sent them back, they then tasted like they redropped the same fries in the chicken nugget oil. I will never go there again."	1 star

21257	Exactly what you'd expect from a McDonald's minus the speed which is disappointing for fast food. We went during what seemed to be rush hour but there was only a skeleton crew on and a single server. We waited for 40 minutes for our food and some of it came cold.. i dont even know how that happens. Definitely not impressed by the service	2 stars
21258	"First time at this location.  The drive thru young lady was so sweet and had great communicating skills when she took my order and when she took my payment. The lady at the next window, who gave me my food was very friendly too. Great staff! At first I didn't want to got to a Mcds in the strip but I'm glad I did! Thank you guys!"	5 stars
21259	"It smelled like a dead body in there. Filthy floors, meth heads laying on the sidewalk outside. The food was vile and disgusting, I threw it out the window within a block and it was still there the next morning. It's pretty bad when racoons and homeless meth heads won't even eat it."	1 star
21260	"Don't bother using mobile app. You will wait in line.  Doors locked and no signs telling you lobby closed.  Manager making excuses claiming there is notice, 20+ people count find one.  Needs to be fired for lying .   We visited 4/1 @ 9:55am and parking lot was full of people trying to get into store tugging on doors wondering what is going on."	1 star
21261	"All around the inside is Fair. but need to check air vents its dirty. All Soda Machine need to be constantly  watched because  when its busy it gets nasty and dirty .. floor looks clean but need more cleaning. and the windows all around need to be cleaned, and of course the frame.

Very Impressive One As far as the overall look.

Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat here.

Customer Service is Very Poor. Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their training. And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they don't like to be friendly and all showing , how great and wonderful to have a job ..that lets you interact with people ..This is one of the most questioned part of Hiring. Are a People Person? Are good or happy to be around People. ETC.,

The Outside Area is good , Actually better than good.

Food is very good , but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the top. I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or not...

So, you have good location ,, ok dining area , staff not satisfied, not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or problems?

This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE  a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment ...and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE."	4 stars

Our orders were incomplete, we asked staff to help us with the missing orders but it took 3 staff to confirm including the lady manager ( i think her name us caroline) before we get our orders completed.

21263	This McDonald's is okay is located right next to Harrah's Casino convenient but the sweet tea was not really that sweet they don't really do bundle deals I'm from the south. I had to wait over 20 minutes for my 20 piece and another lady next to me was waiting on hers it wasn't the cashier's fault but her back crew never drop them but overall I like the McDonald's like I said it's okay	3 stars
21264	This place completely ignores the folks that come inside. They will focus on the Drive thru and that's it. Don't expect much from Macdonalds to start with but this REALLY lowered the bar	1 star
21265	"As McDonald's goes it was that. However the food genuinely looked like the picture. It was clearly made to order. Wish I could've used the restrooms. I guess they didn't know that you can block off every other sink, urinal, stall or whatever. It was the last free standing McDonald's with parking southbound from Vegas. Bottom of Vegas Blvd."	4 stars
21266	"The lady in front of me had a coupon for an ice coffee or something and the order taker thought it was for a regular coffee. So the manager comes over and tells the lady she needs to pay an extra dollar to get the ice coffee  The lady customer then shows her the coupon which must have made the manager mad because she sternly tells the order taker to give her her ice coffee .

Then she rudely tells everyone in line to go use the kiosk  that they'll no longer take orders the normal way.
I'd already stood in line almost 10 minutes and was next but that didn't matter.

Ever since they changed this McDonald's around a couple of months ago and got new management the service, to me, has been terrible, which really sucks because for over 2 years now this is where I mostly take my breaks.
After tonight I will no longer buy food from the McDonald's on the Strip at four seasons."	1 star
21267	Longest line. Taking one car order and pick up at a time and the people are so irritating. Ask for an original ice coffee like it says on the menu and they said                             ahh what                           s that.        	1 star

You get what you expect at McDonald's and that's all you're asking for.  Cheap fast good tasting food.  So if you're staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and you're looking for something cheap take the 5 minute walk and head over to McDonald's.  You will only feel a little guilty."	5 stars

21330	It's been a long time since I have received the attitude I did when I asked for the coke I had ordered but did not receive. Hopefully this is not a regular example of behavior for this location.	1 star
21331	"Fast service, online order pickup was prompt and ready to go upon arrival. Open late [early] and walking distance from Mandalay Bay. Only restaurant open besides Subway during twilight hours in the area."	5 stars
21332	Manager Vanessa was the rudest person I have ever met. She was cursing at customers. This place needs new management.  Very disrespectful.	1 star
21333	"Everything was good except kiosk ordering.  Must use credit card, and if you have not used there kiosks it is a bit confusing."	3 stars
21334	"Kinda dirty, kinda sketchy, there was a homeless guy shouting at random people about the crimes hes committed. The only savings grace was the secuirty guard threatening the push him into traffic if he came back on the property. Haha! If nothing less, it was entertaining!"	3 stars
21335	Pricing is wrong and people will bud you and they serve them without issue. Brutal location.	1 star
21336	This McDonalds is like home and has a good down to earth vibe. I would of gave five stars but the hang ups I have is the homeless people in the drive thru constantly begging. Its just getting really annoying. Like I wanna order my food and eat without being bothered. I hope the get a little more mindful of that. Also many times I order something and they often forget to put everything I'm the bag. I know this mcdonalds gets a lot of traffic and is busy but those are the only pickles I have.	4 stars
21337	It was late at night so I was happy to see they we still open. But the food was made terrible very sloppy and had a bad smell to it. So I was unsatisfied.	2 stars
21338	"It's simple. Website says open 24 hours, yet they're closed at 4am on a Saturday night with workers inside. Unacceptable."	1 star
21339	"""Open 24 hours"" we got here at 2.30 am and they say it's not open until 3.30 am. Finally they open at 3.40 am but they wouldn't accept cards, only cash. Then the girl at the cashier, Heidi she said, was attending the register and then going to the kitchen, no gloves, touching the food, so rude and so loud, terrible service here today."	1 star
21340	Sad that they only had three employees. God bless them and shame the way McDonald's treats employees. This is a Corporate owned not a franchise. Bad       	1 star
21341	"Very busy
Staff were ok.
Didn't have lemon for my tea"	4 stars
21342	Could be because the place was under construction but the service was ridiculously slow: we spent at least 5 minutes at the second window. The lady tried to keep two of our drinks and there was no napkins in the bag.	2 stars
21343	"I eat here for lunch a lot and I've never seen a ton of homeless people here. I see one once in a while outside, but that's it. Food is served fast and fries are hot! I love it here."	4 stars
21344	"Bathrooms are locked in a way that only a manager can open them.  Then, there's no hand soap or toilet paper.  Took FOREVER to get us our food.  Just sub-satandard...even by McDonalds standards!"	2 stars
21345	What you'd expect from a busy McDonalds in Vegas.  Decent food.  Decent speed.  Good service.  Only reason for three stars was the weird guy in a bowtie.  Are you a McDonalds greeter? Is that a thing? Either way nobody going to McDonald's wants to be bothered.  We go out to eat and sit down to be bothered.	3 stars
21346	Nice service by the employees very satisfactory. Some of the people seemed to not have to go anywhere. Taking up places to sit for families but quick and pleasant.	4 stars
21347	Service sucks                             unable to provide my order before 45 minutes of waiting. Then received the	1 star

21350	Service support for drive-thru  was excellent! I asked for fresh food (Chicken nugget combo with large half cut Ice tea). It was worth the wait.  Thank you	5 stars
21351	"Every McDonalds on the planet has the two sausage mcmuffin with egg for $3.33 special except for these guys. The lady taking the order says ""we don't have specials - there's too many tourists."" After getting a manager to translate ""can I have a receipt please"" to the cashier that spoke zero english, I took my overpriced food and split. The one positive is the three bums fighting in the parking lot did provide for some entertainment while I waited."	1 star
21352	"Best to look for other stores, coz this one won't deliver your order ever"	1 star
21353	They no respect the prices for example the breakfast promotion 2 sauce McMuffin for $4.50 they want pay $8.45	1 star

Didn't like it that the employee wasn't all that helpful about their menu availability at 430 am.
But the breakfast was good."	4 stars
21357	"$3.88 for two large cokes?  You can go eff yourselves.  The McDonalds down the street charges $1.08 each.  Or, I can stop at Circle K on my way home from the Strip and get a Polar Pop 44oz for .79 cents plus tax."	1 star
21358	Can't get a refill because of Covid?  All you have to do is use a new cup.  I think at a $1.79 per drink one cup won't cut into the profit margin that much.  But I wouldn't want to send McDonald's into bankruptcy.  Quit being cheap and hiding behind Covid for an excuse.	1 star
21359	I work the midnight hours down the street. Stopped by at 0130 and the place was closed. Not a 24 hour operation.	1 star
21360	Ordered inside to go. It was very busy. Took 20 minutes to get my order.	4 stars

I'm sorry but mcds make billions per day and steals even more. Going 2 manager .Seriously people needs 2 be more aware what companies are doing. You say it's only 2.00 but it happens all the time.

21365	Always leaving off specified add-ons or ignoring substitutions even with display screen& reciting order                                	1 star
21366	We stayed at the Tropicana and didnt want to pay $21.95 each for breakfast so we went here.  It was a 10 minute walk ( it's across from Mandalay Bay) and encountered 2 homeless men along the way but it was worth the walk.  Food and service were excellent and the prices the same as other McDonalds.   The place is new and clean.   The is also a Subway in the strip mall.   Highy recommend if you can stand the heat durind the walk.	4 stars
21367	"Meh...just meh. Back in the day McDonalds was a treat you looked forward to, now the foods more expensive, the fries are never fresh, and the buns are usually stale. They've dropped the ball."	2 stars

The toilets were also a bit messy, but at least the bowl was clean so far.
I ordered a Cpy Buttermilk Chicken Burger which tasted very good.

There are signs all over asking you to limit your stay to 30 minutes. I've seen the line to order going front the order window to outside the door. But, there are kiosks available to order from.

If you can get to a different location, then do it."	3 stars

22155	"A Culinary Ode to McDonald's: The Epitome of Delicious and Affordable Dining

Never cease to amaze us with your consistently appetizing offerings, and your unwavering commitment to providing mouthwatering meals at unbeatable prices. A true beacon of fast-food excellence, McDonald's has reigned supreme for generations, and its legendary menu items have captured the hearts and taste buds of millions around the world.

One of the crowning jewels of McDonald's, their nuggets are nothing short of extraordinary. With a golden, crispy exterior and tender, juicy interior, these delectable nuggets are the epitome of culinary perfection. They are seasoned to perfection, giving each bite a harmonious blend of savory and flavorful goodness. It's no wonder that these little bites of heaven have become a staple in fast food history.

And let us not forget the pi                  ce de r                  sistance that is the Quarter Pounder    ld's dedication to providing affordable, high-quality dining experiences for all. Each bite of the Quarter Pounder                   boasts a succulent, juicy patty cooked to perfection, smothered in a tantalizing blend of cheese and crispy bacon. The mouthwatering aroma alone is enough to send my senses into overdrive.

Paired with a generous serving of their world-famous fries and a refreshing beverage, the Quarter Pounder                   with Cheese & Bacon meal is a steal at just $8.99. It's no exaggeration to say that McDonald's is making a significant charitable contribution to society by providing these scrumptious meals at such affordable prices. They are not just satisfying our hunger but also nourishing our souls with the joy and comfort that only their delicious food can bring.

So, to McDonald's, we raise our glasses (and our nuggets) in praise and admiration. Thank you for your unwavering dedication to quality, affordabilitynd the countless memories you've helped create around shared meals and moments of pure, palate-pleasing bliss."	5 stars

Our drinks were stolen from our table as my children sat and waited for my wife and I to retrieve our order. We called a manager to pull video surveillance, which showed exactly which homeless person stole our drinks and called the police to file a theft report. The local police were completely useless, did not press any charges despite video footage, sided with the homeless thief and said if they arrested him that a thousand more would do the same thing. Really!? I received zero apologies or compensation from McDonald                           s, the police I called, or the thief in the photo.

22169	"Wasn't mcd known for fastfood?  Had to wait in line for 25 minutes to order... the self order kiosks were not working. Then waited another 10 minutes to get my order for 2 coffees, hash browns and 2 mcmuffins.  SLOWFOOD!"	3 stars
22170	The workers were so helpful to me. I had a very special need and they worked together to help me individually. These workers are awesome!!	5 stars
22171	"I went here for my morning pina and I found it pretty delightful! The creaminess was slightly thinner than I was hoping and there was a palatable butternut squash undertone that was confusing my palette. Nevertheless, not bad for franchise pina. I ended up going to the Laylow a few blocks away and ordered 19 coladas, who were quite accommodating as we rolled dice in the corner."	4 stars
22172	"No Mocha Frapoes?! Boohoo! Food here was dry, flavorless, no seasoning.  Homeless are camped right at entrance-smells like urine, trashy, alcohol smell, sorry but this ones a Yucky MickyD for sure."	1 star
22173	"Stopped here to get my daughter some dinner, fries came out hot and they were packed in, nuggets were good and Oreo McFlurry was good, my daughter was very pleased as another McDonald              "	4 stars
22174	"SLOW service. I ordered a spam egg over rice platter as soon as I arrived to the store and waited 20 min.

It was delish tho!"	2 stars
22175	"No bathroom, what McDonald's has no bathrooms? Clearly an anti homeless measure. Instead of punishing the homeless maybe the city should search for a solution, and all the wealthy businesses of the area should contribute instead of sucking the city dry."	1 star
22176	"I bought quarter pounder w/ cheese and 2 Haupia pies, we get hone and i have 2 ""apple pies"" because they did not say they ran out of ""Haupia Pies""!! Sad..."	4 stars
22177	I love the McDonalds app it                           s really good you just have to be close to check in so	5 stars
22178	"It's better off ordering ahead on the app, but there is still a wait for food regardless. 13 minutes for 1 plain sundae."	4 stars
22179	Service was overall good and staff was friendly. I liked that this location had a touch of Hawaii to it compared to the typical ones you would see on the main land.	5 stars
22180	"The day manager was aweful. We were staying at the Alohilani Resort and decided we just want a simple lunch.  We ordered a Mc nugget meal, 2 fish sandwiches and two pies.  The pies were reason we went there.  I got back to the hotel realized they weren't there. Went back she assured me she put 1 pie in the bag. I go back to the hotel find the reciept and my husband ordered two pies.  Instead of apologizing for error she said next time bring back the whole bag of food.  Obviously she knows nothing about the Aloha spirit which is prevalent all around the rest of the island."	1 star
22181	"Very busy but tables were cleaned quickly and table service was quick, sausage and egg muffin was perfect and hash brown was crispy (probably the best I've ever had).
Not a great coffee selection but my fresh coffee with cream was good. Also its probably the cheapest breakfast for a few miles around here."	5 stars
22182	"I rarely eat fast food but yes it was open late and we needed food.
Only one ordering computer open, such a large restaurant limited to such a small area and no bathroom. Really makes no sense.
Super slow service and the people that come here are super questionable. One guy was so far gone I don                           t think he knew he was at McDonald   "	2 stars
22183	"It was okay, the ice cream machine was down and service was slow, and they didn't seem to be in a hurry to please the customer,  but the food was decent"	3 stars
22184	It was very different but we were ready for some fast food because we had been eating the food on the ship but what I found really odd is this place had no bathrooms I was thinking because they are so close to the beach just very strange	5 stars

22187	I can't believe they don't have public restroom! There was security that can monitor or only allow customers with receipts! Isn't it again health laws to not have a restroom?	2 stars
22188	Lady at cash register very confusing and charged for food not given. There is also no restroom. Food taste like McDonald's.	3 stars
22189	Slowest most incompetent McDonald's on earth. Don't waste your time here.	1 star
22190	"Has a local menu. Food is good but service is non-existent here. You have machines which i used to select my order, however it takes forever to collect cash. You are positioned in the busiest place in town and yet the line doesn't move. I understand you have special needs working but that means their should be a 2nd person helping speed up the line up.  Went 2 different days and whether it's late night or morning, same situation.
Also.. You want to charge $0.50 for tap water. Never heard of a McD's charging for a cup of tap water before."	1 star
22191	"I visited a McDonald's restaurant when I learned about the Hawaii local menu. I wanted to order a taro pie but it was not available. I even went to a different McDonald's but they still didn't have it. It seemed like they no longer make it.

I thought I would like Saimin but the soup was just way too salty. Hubby ordered a regular meal and it tasted the same as what we have in Canada."	4 stars
22192	"12/5/19 = 1 star = spam and egg , love this combination , very look new and so busy . Bad thing is AC is leaking and no restroom . Need to have security to keep away homeless for digging the trash inside the store ."	1 star
22193	"Wish every McDonald's had this breakfast, the deluxe combo with rice hits the spot. I recommend the haupia pies as well. They also do Hawaiian coffee. Wish they served this all day."	5 stars
22194	I feel like I'm in a disease front line Battlefront when there's no bathroom I mean what are they thinking about Public Safety are they thinking that not being sanitary is okay?	1 star
22195	Came specifically for the Guava cream pies and they were amazing!	4 stars
22196	They can't seem to get orders right. Needs better signage to the self ordering kiosks.	3 stars
22197	"Try their Spam, eggs & rice. Don't get that in Houston, Texas."	5 stars
22198	I know its a fast-food restaurant but i was happy with the visit. One of the fastest McDonald's I have ever been to. Great service with hot fries and good burgers. An excellent across the beach location.	5 stars
22199	Not open. Closed permanently. Make plans ahead of time and don     	1 star
22200	"It's McDonald's... You know what you're gonna get. Lobby was closed at the hour we went but there were seating options out by the beach so that was fine.

Its nice to have somewhere cheap and quick to eat late at night because everything else that was open was sit-down and much pricier."	4 stars
22201	As any other McDonalds but here your have a view over waikiki. Too many weed smoking young people who travelled to the islands to become homeless	4 stars
22202	"When you need that late night, wait, no! That wee hours of the morning, everything is closed cure, our go to place. They did a great job of clearing the homeless. Seen this place transform, still quaint but better than nowhere to go when everything is closed!"	5 stars
22203	"Maccas hawaii it is what it is, homeless guy was given left overs from from some random guy who ate at another restaurant. Got crispy chicken burger was good. Mahalo"	5 stars
22204	Good spot for being in a busy spot. Be prepared to share space with the homeless here though. Nature of the beast. Food was hot and the order was on point. Cleanliness of facility was lacking. Didn't appear to be a dedication dining room professional. They'd probably need a few at this spot to keep up.	4 stars
22205	"This McDonald's is across the street from Waikiki Beach. Don't forget to try the Hawaii only meals with Spam, rice and eggs! Prices are slightly higher than other McDonald's but A LOT cheaper than surrounding restaurants! Enjoy!"	5 stars
22206	Great location to get a cup of coffee to kick start early in the day	5 stars
22207	Actually not bad for a McDonald's!	4 stars

22209	"The people were so friendly and inviting there, especially the other customers. The workers were great, considering that they worked under such stressful conditions. 5 star restaurant, great price for dinner and a show! Totally recommend! The other customers have to have been the most friendly people that I have ever met. I saw this girl crying tears of joy at the table next to us. So heartwarming!"	5 stars
22210	"It's a McDonalds...  It's always busy, and the staff do their jobs, but no one's in a rush in Waikiki."	4 stars
22211	"I would give 5 stars only for the coffee and soft serve they sell. I have had a better experience with McDonald's - customer service, product quality, and menu variety wise out of U.S vs. within the U.S. U.S market definitely needs improvement."	5 stars
22212	"Need a better system for rush hour, waited almost an hour for breakfast."	1 star
22213	"Dirty, flies everywhere, staff that is not necessarily rude but were all doing the bare minimum. I get it, this is a busy location with a lot of tough customers but there was only one active register, all kiosks were off, screen was broken and not displaying correctly. 80% of the restaurant was closed and everyone was packed like sardines. It's the one if the only things available late around here though so you kinda have to just make do. Oh and ofc the ice cream machine was broken :)"	1 star
22214	"Right across from the beach, it's a really nice location. Great to grab something quick to have on the sand.
The fried pies... especially the taro kind... Are far superior to other McDonald's pies."	4 stars

22224	"The service is quick, and the workers are friendly.  Never had any issues here.  Only kindness.  Love McDonald's because the food is tasty, and the prices are right.  In Hawaii they serve a local breakfast with Portuguese Sausage and Rice.  The Ice Coffee is only $1 if you use the deal on the app.  Comes in different flavors."	4 stars

22228	"During our stay in Waikiki, We always order for our boys happy meals. With each purchase, only 1 ranch was placed in 1 happy meal.When we asked for the other happy meal, we were told that is 1 ranch per customer no matter how many happy meals you buy. We went back and purchased the two happy meals separately to get 1 ranch in each box!"	1 star
22229	Had to use the kiosks and that's not the best way to order for me.	3 stars
22230	"This isn't the typical cosy McDonald's. When handing over the ice cream corn, my wife did not catch well and dropped it on the counter. Although the server gave us another one, he didn't show the pleasure face, but some madness in his face. Definitely not the McDonald's I knew."	1 star
22231	"Definitely seems par for the course in the ""new"" Hawaii. Service was horrible. Staff acts like you're asking them to pull their teeth out when you try to give an order. Asked for 2 sundaes, got 1. Asked for bbq sauce, got 1. Asked for a second d one and they acted as if they take it out of her check. Seems the ""Aloha"" of Hawaii is melting away fast from their local businesses. Fries taste like fish.... very disappointing"	1 star
22232	"Its been awhile since I last  eat at McDonald's  and so I thought I'd  go in and have a Big Mac, when I ordered  she repeated  one Big Mac, 40 minutes  later they called  my number  it wasn't  a Big  Mac,  it was a crispy chicken, so the manager came and recognized the  problem  then went  away ,the cashier told me  if I want my money back I would have to  get back in that first line. So now I'm  kinda  hot,  then about  3 minutes  later the manager was waving a bag from the  counter at me , so I walk up  and she said  heres your Big Mac sir, let me tell you  that was the tastiest  Big Mac I've had in  years!"	2 stars

Forgot to put bbq sauce for nuggets                   "	2 stars
22234	"Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Ave. Long line in the morning for breakfast. Staff friendly and they can/will deliver to your table--which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Complaints: homeless person racked out at one of the tables; some tables smelled  (my 4-yr-old granddaughter asked me if we could move). Nonetheless, that was just one area so if you gotta go to McDonald's while visiting this end of Waikiki, it's a good choice. Picky's Tip: there are self serve kiosks up near counter. So if in long line, check them out--for some reason people were not using them. Saved at least 15 minutes and that's how you get table delivery."	4 stars
22235	"Lost McDonald's in Honolulu, if you can avoid going here I would. The staff are rude and very cheap. I ordered 2 spicy chicken meals and our burgers weren't even in the bun everything was all over the place. When I asked the girl there for more sauce since we had 2 burgers and 2 fries but she said they don't give it. I went to the McDonald's 2 mins aways yesterday and they gave me as many sauces as I needed without charge. I would suggest walking the extra 5 mins and going to the other McDonald's its worth it.

22244	The million dollar sunset views from the patio are phenomenal!	5 stars
22245	"Same good old McDonald's food plus local favorites like the Portuguese breakfast that has rice, sausage and eggs. Everything is overpriced to sync with the high rent in Waikiki.

I only ever got coffee but it was not bad, I'm typically quite picky but for a dollar I got a few during my stay. I enjoyed the interesting people that would come in through-out the day and also the less fortunate in the late hours. Good conversations and the staff where pretty chill about the homeless most nights. They are people too. We only got kicked out one night, but there was many of us just sleeping to be fair.

They need to retrain their staff on safe food handling. Not our first choice, but we had just landed from a 9-hour flight, and it was the only place without a line out the door. Don't take this to mean their service is fast; it's not.

My husband was food-poisoned (probably undercooked meat) on the first night of our honeymoon. Our first night and day was spent in the hotel room with him getting sick. The next day, we went back to tell the manager, and she couldn't have done or cared less."	1 star

22300	It's McDonald's by the beach and has spam and rice.  For that it gets an extra star.	3 stars
22301	This is garbage service. Asked for two sauces they said only one sauce per order. No matter how many items you order. Nonsense! Go somewhere else. Price is not even that low.	1 star
22302	"This place is crowded.  Located right on the popular Waikiki strip, it's a familiar, inexpensive and one would think, a quick go-to, however you will wait a good 15-20 minutes for your fast food.  Oh, and   NO   BATHROOMS  :("	3 stars
22303	"The biggest seller to me is that it is open 24 hours a day.  It helps to have somewhere to go eat when your biological clock is ahead of the local time and you wake up hungry.  The food was hot.  The drink was cold.  Service was great.

During my visit, there were two vagrants got into an argument by the main entrance.  One parked his belongings and entered, while the second one exited and began to rifle thru them.  A few cuss words and flung arms in gesturing and the situation calmed down.  The staff observed for an outcome prior to engaging, so I am going to assume that this has occurred before and they got the handle on it."	4 stars
22304	"First visit service and food were good, HOWEVER on returning the next day for an afternoon snack they                            lost                            our paid for order and then proceeded to QUESTION the validatin"	1 star
22305	"When you go to pick up a meal, you tell her politeness many times. She doesn't pay any attention to you at all, and she's very impolite, so she can't hear you. How can such employees work in McDonald's."	1 star
22306	New chicken sandwiches are tasty and priced reasonably.  Only recommendation is some kind of sauce or mayo be added to this sandwich.  Kind of bland and dry.  The spicy chicken sandwich is too hot and also should have mayo added.	5 stars
22307	"This McDonald's location can get pretty busy. Some of the meal and specific item prices are higher than other locations, but that's to be expected. Service is good and fast. Good spot to grab an ice cream cone on a hot day!"	5 stars
22308	Location packed due to being within waikiki as a result of this it is recommended to order ahead via the app! Line can take 10minutes or more! And can be stressful. Burger packs offered.	4 stars
22309	Very affordable and much yum   	5 stars
22310	Where else are you going to go to have a cheap breakfast.	4 stars
22311	I downgraded my review because up a cash machine. It says skip the line use these machines to order. But then it says it's not taking cards. So you have to stand in line anyway. I live in the neighborhood and this has happened a lot at this location. Frustrating!	3 stars
22312	Very busy and chaotic but the staff were efficient and kind. The place was tidy and we'll kept. Food was great as usual.	5 stars
22313	"Terrible manager tonight!  Ordered two fries, one was ready right away, the other had to be fried and then made me wait for the other fries and gave me one cold order and one fresh.  All would have been done at same time if she had paid attention to her customers!"	1 star
22314	"One of the worst McDo I have visited. Brown lettuce, wet chicken. Bad service. At least, the place is clean."	2 stars
22315	"Nice View - SurfbBreak Across the Street, Friendly Service - but No Restrooms!"	5 stars
22316	Slowest fast food joint in the world. Took 45 minutes to get an egg McMuffin on a Wednesday at 9am.	2 stars
22317	"Cheapest place to eat at the Ocean front.  I would grab a sandwich and fries walk across the street and watch the sun set, they have benches. You can't sit inside with Covid, but why would you is you can have a view of the ocean while eating."	4 stars
22318	Service is fast; restaurant is clean despite the amount of visitors	5 stars
22319	"Surprisingly efficient McDonalds! We ordered from the kiosk and opted for the table service. We ordered a whole breakfast and someone came by after 5 minutes despite the long line! Note, there's no washroom here so beware! The workers here were constantly cleaning the tables which was great. Definitely one of the best McDonalds I've ever been to!"	5 stars
22320	Slowest employees ever.  They are the most inefficient group of workers. Feel bad cause they                           re older and look like they are kind of trying..  But everyone in line was frustrated af.	1 star
22321	Your Covid rules are ridiculous! In your effort to keep everyone safe you bunch everyone up either ordering or waiting for their food. Your restaurant is plenty big to separate people out use it!	2 stars
22322	"Ate here a few times... don't judge me... I have an 11 year old!! Lol... you know what you're getting with McDonalds and you knew they'll eat it. Food was good.

Service a little slow... due to coming out of COVID-19 no doubt."	4 stars
22323	"Really good service, great option if you don't want to pay a lot for food."	4 stars
22324	"This location is right on the beach. Photos are from the beach looking away from the ocean. Always crowded lots of tourists. They have the new self order kiosks. I recommend using them. Nice place to sit and watch the beach goers. Save me a seat! They used to film Hawaii Five-o quite a lot at this spot. (Also seen in the photo is a warning sign for the filming area.)
No restrooms. There are some on the beach about 1 1/2 blocks towards diamond head."	3 stars
22325	Very slow..but clean and wide area to eat in..all in all par for Waikiki..	3 stars
22326	The main reason for the 1 star is the overnight lady that works the cash register is extremely rude has a terrible attitude. I live close by and the time before i last i went she was very rude that time as well also that occasion my nuggets were cold so this time i asked for them to be made fresh upon asking i recieved a dirty look rolled eyes and a grunt the next time i go if shes rude again i will get her name and do another review	1 star
22327	"No soda and asked manager about it and she replied there was none and walked away, there was only Powerade and orange fanta"	4 stars
22328	This is a very very very busy location. They only have one register open and they want to push you to using the kiosks. So for a fast-food you stand there waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting to take your order then waiting waiting waiting waiting to get your food no longer fast food you might want to think about going somewhere else. Also they're doing nothing with the homeless with your kind of occupying most seats. Very disappointing but I blame this on corporate because corporate needs to get involved.	3 stars
22329	"Clean. Good and fast service. As accessible as any small McDonald's. Nice stop between the beach and the hotels. The most inconvenient and unexpected thing, however, is the lack of a public washroom. Disinfectant wipes are provided by the doors."	3 stars
22330	"Very popular but as always, you know what you're going to get the world over! The trouble with this one is that filthy dirty homeless people (sorry, but they are - Waikiki you need to clean up your act) are allowed  to go and sit in there without buying anything and staff let them do it. It is very pleasant."	3 stars
22331	"Clean prompt service, usual fare."	3 stars
22332	"I ran here to grab my wife some breakfast one morning. We had grown tired of the spam sushi and other Hawaiian ""delicacies"" and wanted some good ol' fast food breakfast. I ordered the hot cake meal and a McGriddle. I returned to the hotel to find they didn't give me syrup. Upon returning, they tried to charge me a quarter for the syrup they forgot."	2 stars
22333	"It used to be nice and warm inside. Now it is cold inside and therefore not warm, not welcoming.  Homeless people went in to refill and a crazy lady took a rag to pretend she works there, moving a rag right and left near where the cold drinks are"	3 stars
22334	Just grab some ice coffee and a sausage mcmuffin to go. No drive thru but they do have kiosks to order from. We wanted to try the ube and hapiua pie but they were eternally sold out thr week we were there :(	3 stars
22335	"bring spam to the mainland, you cowards"	5 stars
22336	"Very busy, staff does a good job.   Suggest order ahead."	5 stars
22337	"Food was great. Even sandy bottoms. You know , from SpongeBob? She came on me
in the bathroom. ANYWAYS, the food was great, I like to move it move it , I like to move it move it, kanechuwa. The 2.99 coke? MMMMMMMM"	5 stars
22338	Awful service. We waited 25 mins from ordering our food to actually getting it. Staff were extremely unhelpful	1 star
22339	"Went after midnight, had a decent line. Service was slow. Server could barely speak English which made other customers irritated (that I observed). Fries were barely salted as I watched them take it out the fryer. They also barely filled them up to it's full capacities. I dumped my medium and my friends large and they were both small in size. Chicken nuggets tasted like cardboard. Mcchicken had too much mayo. Sucks Mcdonalds...."	1 star
22340	Quick meal Waikiki. Across the street from beach.  Outside seating incredible view	5 stars
22341	"New kiosk to order from instead of standing in a line to order, is a fantastic idea.
Accuracy of orders picked up is a whole different issue. Constantly having to ensure all food ordered are in fact in the bag, is quite annoying."	4 stars
22342	"Fast service and completion of order, pleasant staff(all female), nice location next to the beach. Some homeless people in there with their belongings on the tables at far back. Mostly keeping to themselves."	4 stars
22343	"I went late at night at 3am and I guess their registers were being counted or something, so they manually calculated everyone's order at the time.  All in all this one cashier is a complete idiot!!!! she gave me the wrong change even after I corrected her, but she didn't care.  Had to speak to another employee and then the ""manager"" to get my correct change.  4 people with similar orders received their orders before I did and then again I had to bring it up for them to realize I've been waiting.  Worst experience ever and never going to that cashier again!!!!!!!"	1 star
22344	"Great food, decent service, good prices. Short wait so you         "	4 stars
22345	Excellent well worth going to	4 stars
22346	"Had an interview with the manager Barbra the experience was phenomenal from the moment I walked in the atmosphere of the room was very light and forgiving. With tourist busily and undecidedly wandering about, and workers happily and busily taking orders and cleaning common areas. I learned a lot about McDonald's as a company. They have so many opportunities for their employees. I was truly blown away
By how amazing it could potentially be for me to work under a fast food restaurant that gets so much backlash from media and my own friends. Five stars for me      "	5 stars
22347	It's a McDonald's eat at one and you've eaten at them all. Don't really ever frequent fast food joints unless it's my last resort. For being the last resort it ok	3 stars
22348	If you're planning on eating their allow enough time to stand in line. I've been there the last two days service is very slow. The chicken McNuggets tasted like a fish sandwich. And if you going to eat make sure you go to the bathroom because there are no bathrooms at this facility. I think they should just shut it down	1 star
22349	"The SPAM and rice at this McDonald's are fantastic. Recommend avoiding the portuguese sausage. I also really loved the pineapple pies (deep-fried, not baked) when they were available for a limited time. The new buttermilk tenders are great and I love their honey mustard. Why can't Canada have nice things?"	5 stars
22350	"All right, orders been wrong three out of three times. I'm just going to go to the one on kuhio

Update: order was wrong a fourth time and it took them three tries to get me a taro pie"	1 star
22351	Place was crowded but we got a table to sit at without any problems. The only downside was that the machines where you could self order at the kiosk were all down.	4 stars
22352	"Huffy/puffy employees with an attitude that will NOT listen. I specifically asked for seasoned fries three times while ordering, and then asked if she would give me the packets now (as they usually do) and she said I'd get them with my order. I did not. Had to wait for the woman to come over again (with the next order) to ask for seasoning and she walked away before I could specify the flavor (ranch). Handed me a random flavor (cheesy) and walked away again. Had to wait for her to serve the next order to ask for ketchup.

Overall very unorganized and chaotic service. A very loud, crowded, and dirty location with no bathrooms.

I understand the employees are busy and under a lot of stress but the management needs better crowd control and to hire more employees to handle the work load and provide better customer service."	1 star
22353	Transient folks were arguing in the store..cussing and offending all who were there.  If u didnt have 90 cents..they would cuss at you.  I know the ladies that worked there felt helpless.  Need to have security protect paying customers.	2 stars
22354	Late night meal choice was ok. Tried the new chicken sandwich was really good. You could only do take out.	4 stars
22355	Kind of a bummer that they still don't have dine in available. But it helps that it's right across from the beach so you can walk there and eat by the ocean!	4 stars
22356	Wish i could give this place 0 stars..Computers go down everynight at the same time and slows service. This has been happening for the last 10 years. The after hours employees are zombies.... Very slow and unaware of whats going on in the place. Trash cans are left over flowing and customer service is 0.. Have a good talk with your night manager. Remember McDonald's is a part of the service industry.... i love McDonald's but myself and my friends will never set foot into this one again.	1 star
22357	Fast service. The lunch box specials were great.	5 stars
22358	McFlurry is not properly done. The management could really put more effort into training the employees	3 stars
22359	"It's alright. Although they need to upgrade on a few features especially public restrooms, even Burger King (in Waikiki Beach), is way smaller than McDonalds on Kalakaua, and it has bathrooms. What I dislike the most is when the employees forget my order, and then gives me missing pieces of the order, for example, you would order a Big Mac, 20 piece chicken nuggets, and a soft drink, and then they forget your chicken nuggets. And don't tell me you didn't experience this, all my years in Waikiki and yet they fail to exceed my order."	3 stars
22360	Mcds is wat it is. In some more trying times in my life mcds was literally a lifeline so I have to give them props. Although eating only mcds will legitimately be fatal after a month straight do not attempt.	4 stars
22361	True to their word they're open 24/7 and it's hot and fresh. Thank you!	5 stars
22362	"Limited menu, expensive beach location without a public bathroom.  They make a huge deal about fresh pineapple with value meals but forgot to give it to us.  Very young and disorganized staff. Not what I expected from a mcdonalds!"	2 stars
22363	"Got breakfast here and it was as expected from McDonald's. Even with it being busy, got my food pretty quickly."	5 stars
22364	Breakfast was good here in the morning as it was nice and fresh and hot. A few days later we tried it out for dinner and it was mediocre at best.	3 stars
22365	"The worst McDonald's I ever been too. Not enough workers and, waited 40 minutes on my food, and the order was wrong. This is suppose to be FAST FOOD."	1 star
22366	"This was a pretty nice McDonalds, beach view, kona blend iced coffee was amazing, they have local foods and fresh cut pineapple. There were a lot of people but barely a line and we got our order pretty quick compared to a lot of McDonald's. Just visiting the area but I'll have to get another kona blend iced coffee before I go, cant get those in California"	5 stars
22367	"They served us a RAW McChicken burger. I assumed McDonalds used standardized equipment to ensure all food is properly cooked prior to serving it to customers. Absolutely disgusting. I would highly recommend checking your food from here before eating it, as consuming raw meat can lead to very serious food borne illnesses. I've never been more disgusted, ugh."	1 star
22368	"This is by far the cheapest place to eat at Waikiki beach. Unfortunately, that also makes it a very attractive spot for all the drug addicts and homeless of the city. While I generally don't mind homeless people, eating next to a meth addict on a bad trip is not the most pleasant experience. Not one star since you can get sick full for 5$."	2 stars
22369	The line was quick and dine in was open. You have to wait to be seated so they can clean the tables because of COVID.	5 stars
22370	"Slow. I only come here for Diet Coke, and they take forever. Wish that they would speed it up for drink only orders. Always people loitering inside, and homeless loitering outside."	2 stars
22371	"No bathrooms. Lines for cashier is ambiguous.,  Mentally ill homeless use cups from the garbage to use soda fountain. And loiter in dining room. Mentally ill harras dining costomers.  Good thing is coffee is great."	1 star
22372	Terrible mobile app took over $245 for three happy meals and they wouldn                           t even give my kids the happy meal while treating me (8 month pregnant l	1 star
22373	Most of the time there is a line here but if you are staying at a surrounding hotel. This is one of the cheapest options to get quick food. Very friendly staff.	5 stars
22374	"Think McDonald's on the beach.  They do offer local specials like spam, eggs and rice.  Very efficient operation.  Lots of people but the line moves very fast.  Must have great management."	5 stars
22375	"THIS MCDONALD'S DOESN'T HAVE A WASHROOM!

                            I don't eat at restaurants without facilities where I can wash up before eating and I can't believe that not having facilities isn't in violation of a health department bylaw.

This is a restaurant; not a food truck.

The l""street people"" out than their customers' comfort."	1 star
22376	"Over run by homeless people, could use a security guard.  People are always taking cups out of the trash can and stealing soda from the fountains.  Ocean front seating is super nice though."	2 stars
22377	"No bathrooms, very long wait times"	3 stars
22378	Employees are rude as heck.  Why so angry?  Maybe because their boss is a red headed cliwn?	5 stars
22379	"Don't do it! I got a sausage, egg and cheese mcmuffin and I swear it had to have been from breakfast the day before! It was so hard and nasty; not edible. The fries were made right in front of us and even those tasted old. Save your money and go elsewhere. Probably have to say this is the worst McDonalds I've ever been to."	1 star
22380	Service here is real slow and they are not short handed and I only ordered 2 drinks. Order takers and person that seats you are the only high points to this McDonald's.	2 stars
22381	"I never expect much from mcdonalds. They always seem to be dirty and have terriblecustomer service. After visiting so many places and stores on this trip, i guess i assumed they would be on par from the experience i seemed to get all over the island. Nope. Typical mcdonalds. Workers who act like they will die if they have to be polite or have to go out of their way to help. I understand this is cheap fast food but i just dont get how they can all be so crappy"	1 star
22382	"O really liked it here.  Just like all the other ones at home but with Hawaiian food one the menu. The taro pies are to die for.  The day I left,  I bought 2 dozen to bring home"	5 stars
22383	Terrible service during the night shift. On each visit it took more than 10 minutes to receive food. On one occasion my double quarter pounder meat and bun was charred and barely edible.	1 star
22384	Cheapest place to eat on the road.  Only could order in the restaurant and then had to leave. Would have made more sense to have the seating open because everyone gathers in a huddle waiting for food. Just not a great process.	3 stars
22385	"Even though its very busy at times, you won't wait too long for your order."	5 stars
22386	"This McD's seemed to be shorthanded, but worked hard to get it done. We were told by an employee that eventually that McD's would be self order on those machines, and all employees would work in kitchen.  No counter ordering. How sad and so impersonable. We want people to talk to not machines."	4 stars
22387	"They have outside seating (beware of the pigeons) and tourists staring, and beggars right outside McDonalds. But overall, it's McDonald. We didn't wait too long to order food and it was packed with tourist which is cool because it's in Waikiki. They also have a kiosk(right word?) to order food if you don't want to wait in line. Alot of seatings in McDees for groups or individuals. No public bathroom though, beach nearby though with lots of restrooms (closed at night)."	4 stars
22388	"Food was average.
Understaffed.
Too noisy."	2 stars
22389	"Busy, but not as busy as the other breakfast spots. Great if you want a quick meal on the cheaper side."	4 stars
22390	No matter what time of day you wwil see maybe 5 people working in whole store. Usually  one or less (gone for 5 minutes?) cashier working the front. Orders take excessive amount of time fullfill. Thats if you even get what you ordered! This is the slowest Macdonalds I have ever been to in my life.	2 stars
22391	"Excellent location on the beach, I just walked away n with towel and barefeet with all my kids, cheapest food in all of Waikiki, I can't offer to take my family in other exotic eating place around here,"	5 stars
22392	"Have to say for a McDonalds in the Waikiki area it could of been alot better self serve kiosk were not working lines where long because only 1 caisher was up front when they had 3 tills and couldent see a public bathroom in the place

Food was a real disappoint asked for extra bacon and remove stuff but when I got back to our place to eat it was just the default of what the burger was

Sorry would give more but place needs as little work it could be understaffed idk but its could be alot better"	1 star
22393	The food was good but the old lady taking orders was just straight up disrespectful. I don't know who hurt her but it's like she takes her anger on customers. Very impatient.	2 stars
22394	At this location on April 19th 2020 around 10:30am I ordered a Caramel Frapp                   and when I got it they grinded up blue peices of plastic inside the drink I accidentally drank some and returned it to the McDonald's. I got a call from Gallager Bassett I guess they are mcdonalds insurance company but the lady refused to give me any money after they blended plastic in my drink I hav	1 star
22395	"Two conditions gives this McDonald's only 1 star: 1.- Customers chit-chat loudly and management permit them to be disruptive. If you want a quite place to enjoy a meal 'this is not it.' 2.- Third World Countries female employees also shout and yell to communicate with each other, and they treat American customers as ""I can do anything I want and you have no recourse."""	1 star

22398	"My wife and I went to this McDonald's while on vacation in Waikii. The person taking my order apparently did not understand English as she totally screwed up my order. I dont ask much, just be able to understand what I'm saying, Hawaii is still in America after all. The food was as expected, Ok at best. But that our first and only trip there."	2 stars

22404	They was really busy and all we ordered was french fries and took 18 mins. They have plenty of self order machine but they could not keep up with the flow of traffic and tables was not clean.	3 stars
22405	"I don't know what is about fast food in Hawaii. Maybe it's the relaxed lifestyle here, but the time from  ordering at McDonald's (or burger King for that matter) to actually receiving the good takes an awful long time
The staff however are nothing but courteous."	4 stars
22406	Still great fries   	4 stars
22407	"Discalmer, I'm not a big fast food fan. With that said this location was well kept and clean. They had native Hawaiian meals that gave this location some character."	3 stars

22411	I eat here on a daily basis and have endured many of the rude employees unprofessional remarks and looks to me and other customers.  Especially late night with one employee in particular who practically throws the food at people. Today one of the McDonald's employees that wears the name tag as trainer was extremely short and rude talking to me like I was a child regarding a game piece prize claim.  I'll always go to McDonald's because of the great food and good prices despite the lack of quality employees.  I ABSOLUTELY PREFER WALKING TO THE KUHIO AVE LOCATION...FAR MORE PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO SMILE AND WORK HARD.  ONLY ONE GROUCHY MANAGER AND ONE GROUCHY EMPLOYEE AT KUHIO...But two wonderful ladies from India (I think) and one from Micronesia.	3 stars
22412	"Average McDonald's with your standard lack of cleanliness, fair prices and mediocre food."	3 stars
22413	McDonalds is McDonalds. Nothing fancy. My food got to me fast.	5 stars
22414	Convenient but pricy compared to obes right outside waikiki. Sitting outside is a nice view apart from the local bums begging for change while you eat. Workers barely speak english and understand so you have to be very stern and precise or else they try to get you to buy something more expensive..example.. I went in for a hash brown and sausage mcmuffin sandwich which is only $3. Girl was adamant about selling me the meal which was $5 something for a drink added on. Use the android app and save lots of money.	3 stars
22415	"Meh the place usually has a line, free refills and free  Wi-Fi.  Most meals come with PINEAPPLE but its 2.00 extra.  At the time of order simply ask for no PINEAPPLE and the meal.price will be cheaper.  If you forgot to ask for no PINEAPPLE in most cases they give you an apple pie."	3 stars
22416	"Front desk was rude, 30 mins from order to get food. Typical for Waikiki."	2 stars
22417	There is a machine where you can order and pay instead of waiting in line. It serves breakfast all day and is really clean. Loved the fruit punch	5 stars

22423	"Well it is typical McDonalds, nothing more, nothing less. However the location run out of large size cup for soda, only had medium or small, which I really wanted the large one because I was planning to head to a  beach to eat my lunch... so, I was already disappointed at this point, but well things happens so I just let it go.

22430	"Since I am asked to rate my experienced; I would rate it ro be minus; very unsatisfactory.
Tonight I had dinner at McDonald's at Kalakaua & Liluokalani at approximately 9:50 pm Hawaiian time. I purchased 2 Fillet burgers; a small French fry and a senior small coffee.
After finishing I TRIED to receive a medium Mocha frapp                  . According to Your McDonald's app I could get a FREE medium cafe without a purchase. I had received a FREE one before. One of your manager; Diana assisted a clerk as she encountered a problem. On your screen it had mentioned; with purchase; whereas Your app noted FREE. Diana asked me to wait till 11 pm when another manager was scheduled to come in. Crazy. She wanted to wait. After a few exchanges of options to her as I got aggravated. She said; I can call 911! What? What type of training do YOU; McDonald's Corporation of America PROVIDE or HAWAII .....? I have complained so many times it is not funny. To avoid lawsuits better training is uhio McDonald's.

22431	"Wow, a NEW McDonald's right across from the beach in Waikiki. The real estate is a little more than some places so expect a slightly higher price but its still cheap compared to other places in the area. Nothing beats a soft serve ice cream on a hot day."	5 stars
22432	This is quasi-American BBQ.  It's still good though.  The restaurant is very clean and modern and the staff is very professional and friendly.	4 stars
22433	"First Stop After a long flight from Midwest, it is really pricey but it is a good solid gage as to the area economics. The price of big Mac meal? But they give you pineapples with your meal. But after this time to move to ihop and or local food."	3 stars

22454	There was a homeless guy in the restaurant that was being very vulgar.  It did not make for a pleasant meal.  The apple pies here are great.	2 stars
22455	Just the fact that they were obviously close to closing but still they where serving us with an appropriate amount attitude... not only to say they were in the middle of the Waikiki beach and it was 1am.	4 stars

22462	People don't stand in line. They just walk up and order no matter who was there first.	3 stars
22463	The fries were cold and the Big Mac was cold and dry. The first Mc Donalds I ever ate at that didn't have a restroom to wash your hands. Is this even legal?  Terrible Waikiki Mc Donalds.	1 star
22464	Fast lines. Breakfast was a bit different with serving rice with eggs.	4 stars

22469	Better than ours at home. We got pineapple with our meal. They even have a spam and eggs and Portuguese sausage.	5 stars
22470	Service by employees lackluster at best. Seems more of a burden for the help to take an order. Registers are off and voided transactions happen daily.	3 stars

22474	Very long time waiting to make a order. Very large queue	2 stars
22475	Sometimes has a line but service was fast. Nice view from there.	5 stars

22481	This McDonald's is really bad at getting your order. Last time I was here I order a Bic mac and got a chicken sandwich. The other day I came back for a business trip I ordered a mcgriddle and got a regular breakfast sandwich. I had not realized until I got back to my hotel room and did not want to go back as it took a while to order and to wait.	1 star
22482	This place has no restrooms. I didn't like the service and there's a lot of homeless people in here just to spend the night. I don't recommend this location.	1 star

22518	It's worth the 13 hour flight here to order the haupia pie.	3 stars

22792	This is a pretty automated McDonald                           s. Probably one of the most automated ones I                           ve come across. Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order. I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though. Plus the area to stand was congested since it  	4 stars
22793	"This maybe the cleanest McDonald                           s I ever been to. I pass 2 closer ones from my house just to come to this one because of cleanliness, good"	5 stars
22794	"I do not understand how the male supervisor with green locs who is working right now, still has a job. This is the second time I came to me and my children were mistreated at this location. Even writing this trying to remain professional is extremely hard. I went through the drive through on each occasion. He was rolling his eyes, condescending, disrespectful, disregarded my concern, slammed and locked the windows while I was talking                            I walk inside to get an upper management personnel and her name was Roseline. When I asked her if she was above the side in the picture, she threw her arm out and said what happened. She walked away and disregarded my concern. There was a African guy with a coat on in the food are passed me the sauce and told me it was not his job to do so.. this loca"	1 star

22796	"Food was fine. But, when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the register. When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you ""you know we have a cash kiosk?"", to which I responded that people are at it. It wasn't overly rude, but execution was totally annoyed at us the customer. Hope it's not like that next time we visit."	1 star
22797	"More than 30 min of wait 2 buses should have arrived and both routes are late. I don't get it, if  paying with our taxes for this service plus a fare of 2 $ the ride, where is the investment of the company on providing a good services, more buses, more bus drivers better service, better budget. I called and the Lady on the phone left me waiting on hold. I'll seek for an investigation in this situation. hopefully Public resources are being well managed, RIGHT?   "	5 stars
22798	"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food. We would not return to this location."	2 stars
22799	"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.
I visit this location at least 3-4 times a week, never had problems like this with the other shifts."	1 star
22800	Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 3-5 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes. A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink. That is ridiculous.	2 stars

So my customer was cheated out of their order and I was screwed out of $35!!!! I reported the restaurant to Uber support as well as Mcdonalds corporate offices. Avoid this mcdonalds if you can. Terrible!!"	1 star
22802	"The food is always cold there's always a long wait time and some of the managers just don't care. One of them was mad I complained about my fries not being cooked all the way so he snatched them out of my child's hand and those were not even the ones I was complaining about, he then asked me if I had a recipe. When he was the one that took my money and didn't give me one."	1 star

I was given a hi-c .

Untop of it I wish I can post a photo of my two orders of fries thrown on the groud because they were uncooked."	1 star

22806	"There are two lanes of drive through. I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line.  When I got to the speaker,  they didn't bother to ask my order,  or order number.  They just kept taking people from the other line. I know that sometimes happens,  they forget the order cars pull up. But not 4 in a row. As they started taking the 5th car,  I pulled into the line and went to the window.  Food was OK when I got it.  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn't cool."	4 stars

She reluctantly agreed to make a new one a took my receipt.  20 minutes later still no burger. Went to the counter, a girl there gave the burger to someone else. Another burger was made, but they ""lost"" the receipt.  While standing at the counter waiting for a receipt to be reprinted, I was holding onto my bag. A man behind the counter tried to grab the bag out of my hand. I told him ""hands off"", he said he was checking the order number. TOTAL INCOMPETENCE! I went to complete the survey on the receipt BUT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED!!!"	1 star

Fashima and two other gentlemen working were also very friendly and even offered to help carry my food to the table... Almost like we were at a real sit down restaurant the way they took care of us! Thank you. The only thing was that the quarter pounder seemed small and was overcooked and dry.... But we will be back!

Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering... If give her 5 stars                           ""we don't do refills here."" What? So the funny thing is, they are moving to have you order at the kiosk, but you need to ask for the refills, which they don't do because the beverage machine is shut down. Just so you know when you go!"	4 stars

The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasn't a girl it was the man. To which she rolled her eyes,walked away and didn't return. We also didn't recieve our bottle water, napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get."	1 star
22822	"Tiny cramped parking lot makes it hard to get in and out of. Location is in a really commercial touristy area so it's to be expected, I suppose. Didn't go inside, so this is just the drive thru experience. Dual drive thru lines were wrapped around the building at 10pm on a Sunday.
Food ok. Fries and fish bun were a bit stale, considering the long line, was expecting fresher food, I guess.  Good enough for a late snack."	3 stars
22823	This store is always clean. The staff always pleasant and helpful. I've been impressed with them the whole 7 months I've been here.	5 stars
22824	"Lucky they even get the rating they do. Placed a mobile app order at 9:49am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later. Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter, but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk. Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their ""short handed"", yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees. My order was wrong twice. Absolutely cold food. Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable. This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was. Absolutely uncalled for!"	1 star

The inside is clean (as well as the bathrooms) and has a lot of seating.  There's also an indoor play area for the kiddos.  In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers."	4 stars
22829	Not satisfied with purchase. Female manager messed up my order twice. My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger. I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes.	1 star
22830	This is by far the best McDonald's I have ever been too. They serve you your food very quickly and take your trash. They walk around asking if you need anything and are very friendly. Very clean as well.	5 stars

22853	This McDonald's is way more efficient than the other McDonald's down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom. But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to. I didn't get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though.	3 stars

The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.

Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be.

I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke.

I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up.

Always a problem in this branch!

What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald's manager, I was told there's nothing they can do about it.

The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously?

This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

22945	"Just went to this location. Worst service I ever had! I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk. After I couldn't make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk. I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read??? Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they can't make the order at the kiosk??"	1 star
22946	"Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and that's what we (thought we) got. Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing. My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away. My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there. She was slightly aggressive,  we left."	1 star

I definitely will not get this sandwich again here. I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonald's is a major gamble.

1 Big Mac Ml-Lrg
1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink????? The fry was a large, but they were cold. The Big Mac was dry. I forgot why we don't usually go to McDonald's. Thank you for reminding me."	2 stars

A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food.

Friendly staff but I don't like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad, makes it hard to customize your order and confusing.

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay.
McDonald's should explore healthier options for the current market . But still a great experience

23008	I had the worst experience at this location. I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.	1 star

We're going again this morning (I'm not a fast food fan, but hotel breakfast is just pastries), so I'll update the review if my experience is different.

23018	Kind of touch and go with this location. Sometimes they're very attentive and sometimes they don't listen when you're trying to give them your order. Late night is when I've generally had problems with their service. Otherwise they are pretty good.	4 stars
23019	I placed my order at 7:33pm tonight and got the order at about 8:15pm.  I had to call to make sure they received my order. Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it.  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy..   not this place.	1 star
23020	"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left."	1 star

The manager, Judith, stated that if I don't come before 4am them I'd have to wait until the next day to receive my order. Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based, I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine. I understand that my items were not available after that time, but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation. The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are ""too busy""."	1 star
23022	"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while."	1 star

As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up.

23034	"Busy, under staffed, slow service, condiment stand a mess, out of lids, ketchup dispenser broken.  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag!  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table????  Very,  very ill-run and poorly  managed location.  Just  awful."	1 star
23035	I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food. Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still haven't gotten my food. I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand. They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand. This McDonalds sucks	2 stars
23036	"I love this place, I've been to this place for year's and not even one time a worker has been rude to me."	5 stars
23037	Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers	1 star
23038	"McDonald's is ok. I just wish they wouldn't pester people in leaving while the kids are playing in the play place. I mean I get the no loitering, but we bought food, and kids are just trying to play and they didn't really finish their own good. They just wanted to enjoy the empty play area"	3 stars
23039	"I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds, how do you screw up a cheeseburger? I asked for no ketchup, no mustard, no pickles, no onion. I got no condiments and NO MEAT! I mean really, learn to read and pay attention. This is my 3rd time this has happened."	1 star
23040	"Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed"	1 star
23041	Double check your orders. I got someone else order and when i took it back. The employee placed it back to give it to someone else. I told her I touched the burger to throw it away. She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away. Horrible attitude from the cashier. Order was not completed.	1 star
23042	Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.	2 stars
23043	"Long line at kisok, which was only way to order due to lack of staff. Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk. Tea was weak, had been sitting awhile. Terrible experience"	1 star
23044	"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all."	1 star
23045	Only go here because it's open late. Food not always the same presentation or great tasting..but it is McDonald's. What do you expect.... You know when you go there what you're getting. Cheap food..poor customer service.. And maybe your order correct.	2 stars

Food was sat on the counter in a bag whilst staff were stood around not doing a lot. Food was cold. Every table was waiting for their food and the queue to collect was almost at the door. Order was incomplete and had to queue up again to collect t"	1 star
23049	"they took forever and it was hardly busy, i asked if my order was ready after waiting for like 20 minutes and was told no, just to be handed my order less than a minute after, it was sitting there the whole time, and the female working the register was disrespectful for no reason."	1 star
23050	I visited this location during the morning rush. The store was clean and the staff was very punctual. My son and I received our food within 1 minute after ordering. This location looks as if it was recently updated and it includes a playland for the little ones. Based off of today's experience I would recommend this location to anyone visiting.	5 stars
23051	"This location is frequently busy and if the general manager isn't on site, the dining room and play area become dirty quickly.  Service is notoriously slow, and since they cater to primarily a transient crowd, there really isn't a need to improve."	3 stars
23052	"Just stopped by my local McDonald's to pick up some breakfast items before going to work. The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts."	4 stars
23053	"The food is always on the meh side. Luke warm, never hot and fresh even when it's busy and the employees are typically miserable."	4 stars
23054	New interior looks great. This location has the new digital ordering computers. The food came quickly and the staff were helpful. Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasn't marked	4 stars
23055	"All I had was a hot fudge sundae, which was good. The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda. They legally should not have been open. They were still running things as usual though."	2 stars
23056	"Showed up 20 minutes before the menu change and was told I couldn't order what I wanted off of the advertised menu. When I question that to the employee they basically said they were too underpaid and lazy to make me chicken nuggets and all I could have was the two mcChicken sandwiches they had left... Or nothing.

Great customer service... NOT"	1 star
23057	"If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would. Absolutely zero customer service. The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed, neither of them spoke a word in person. The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn't be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at. I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy, but they weren't at all. Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction."	1 star
23058	"Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults. The food is your typical McDonald's fare with nothing special to write about. They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays."	4 stars
23059	"As usual the food prep people don't know how to read a order slip. Big mac no sauce no cheese.
What did I get? Big Mac cheese ONLY on it.
Ya'll did make it thru first grade so you could read simple 3-5 letter words? Right?
Just asking."	1 star
23060	The manager Judith is extremely rude. She gave us cold meals we said excuse me she looked at us and walked away. 6 minutes later she came back to me after leaving me standing there just stared at me and I told her                            I                           m sorry my food is cold                            she turned around grabbed me a new wrap handed it to me and walked away. Never saying a word. We had a second order and still had to wait. It is 	1 star
23061	"This McDonald's was excellent,  the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee, it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald's I have been to.

It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant,  no matter where I go in America,  so far, there is a better than 90% chance that the coffee, for example,  will be the same thing I am use to and desire."	5 stars
23062	It can get tight getting inside when there's a delivery truck next to the store. Most especially when you're going towards the drive-thru   	4 stars
23063	Just horrible service.. this is probably my first review ever and sucks it had to be a negative one.. if you don't like your job then it's best you quit without bringing down the company with you.. lady in the drive thru window at this hour was making fun of patrons trying to order and I happened to overhear. Not something you want to hear when ordering to be honest	1 star

23065	"Quick service, accurate follow up"	5 stars
23066	"They had a broken latte machine.  The kiosk already had our CC deposit.  It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.  They used to make great cappuccinos, but it got to be too loud, and those machines broke more frequently than lattes'."	5 stars
23067	There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again! Open up the lobby people	2 stars
23068	Slow. Food often old.	3 stars
23069	This is one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever seen. Very modern inside. Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food. At least it was very fresh!	4 stars

Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had..."	1 star
23071	This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's	2 stars
23072	Good for a quick bite on the go with a busy day right across the street from Old Town this place is got an indoor playground which is nice. The kids enjoyed it the one time we came in and stopped and let them play. Unfortunately the last time we came through the drive-thru and there was a vagrant near the one entrance so that was a little unsettling other than that has McDonald's go it was okay	3 stars
23073	40 chicken nuggets and 2 large fries for 15 bucks!! Also the ice tea is the best in Florida	5 stars

23083	"This location has slow service and horrible customer service.  The computer order machine was not working,  instead of informing custmers they said nothing. Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong. What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees.  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think , they would emphasize excellent customer service. McDonalds you are slipping."	1 star
23084	This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.	1 star
23085	What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.	1 star
23086	We ordered through the app and we just went up said our order number and our order was ready by the time we got to the window and nothing was missing! Fantastic service!	5 stars

23089	Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a Mcd's. The place was busy and lacked the people/system to handle it. Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate orders. It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order - one chicken wrap with sweet tea.	3 stars
23090	It's a good place for fast food	4 stars
23091	Got the order wrong. Went back. They told me to pull up 2nd window.  They forgot me. Then got the order wrong again.	1 star

23094	"The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations; making orders fast and reliable. Notwithstanding, the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff. Ultimately, the store next to McDonald gives customers a ""free gift"" if you bring your McDonald's receipt."	2 stars

23096	"I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased.

Even though I am trying  to eat healthier these days I just can't stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin. These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly  with a delicious sandwich."	4 stars
23097	"Spent 15 minutes in the drive-thru,  most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food. Didn't get a straw, my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my son's happy meal had no toy. All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn't get either one right even after a 15 minute wait. Completely unacceptable."	1 star

23101	Nice place to eat anytime you want. They are very busy. People come by the bus loads to eat hamburgers all over. It's a tourist trap. Cheap and hot food. Your money goes far. Most people go there for a quick meal and internet which is free.	5 stars
23102	"3 stars for being a clean and friendly McDonald's but it'll never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go there's a 90% chance they are out or the machine is down. Morning? Down. Afternoon? Down? Nighttime? Down. Halloween? Down. On Halloween?! Yes, completely down all night. I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of it."	3 stars

Good grief....this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops...to keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road...	1 star

EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food."	1 star
23113	"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck"	1 star

I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry. Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag. I do not recommend the drive through.	2 stars
23116	Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area.

Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal."	1 star

23140	"This particular McDonalds across from Old Town, is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my #4 chicken sandwich meal.  Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything.... The strips needed more cook time ""my opinion"" so I brought them inside and made the request.... Now it's McDonald's... you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it, told the M.O.D. and he says he can take care of it, he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited. Now when I did receive it, he made sure he gave it to me, and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip! 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn't like."	4 stars

Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street."	2 stars

23157	"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

Getting better and better, the manager Monique she runs a tight ship. Every time I'm in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing. A great thank you for your great service Monique!

Wow place was packed! Was able to wait just a short time and got my order. Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff! Must of been 30+ people in line only 5 min wait. Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks, both with smile's on."	4 stars
23158	I used to love this location. It is the close one to my home. But lately the service has gone down hill. Mostly through the drive thru where I usually get most of my orders! New management or what? Please quit thanking me so much and get my order right. Oh and when I say two cremes and 4 splendas in my coffee get it right. This morning the sticker they put on the coffee said 3 cremes and 4 sugars. I am diabetic. I tested it and it was not right so I waited to get to work and put one more splenda thinking they had not put the right amount. Drank about half when I noticed the sticker. That coffee affected my health because of the sugar! Their is kore but why bore you. Hope they change.	3 stars

23167	I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.	1 star

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean."	2 stars

She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again.

Asked at speaker, window 1, window 2 and the person that made it. Can't do it. And they forgot the hot sauce to my burrito. But this is McDonald's standard."	1 star
23566	"Another aspect that adds to the appeal of McDonald's is the affordability. The menu prices are generally budget-friendly, making it an attractive option for individuals or families looking for a quick and affordable meal. The availability of value meals and combo deals further enhances the value for money."	5 stars
23567	"constantly miss items. it baffles me. I work fast food. items pop up on a screen, you put them in the bag. its very simple. half the time they put ice in the drink when I ask for no ice, which again, a drink pops up on a screen, and underneath it will say ""no ice"".

This McDonald's need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant. When I come to this McDonald's I always spend $40 or better. Get y'all stuff together"	1 star
23569	"This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take customers' orders.  This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter, wishing to place their orders.  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders.  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months, resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant.  Hire more staff!!!"	3 stars

23572	I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.	1 star

I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, the 10 piece nuggets, the fish sandwich and a large iced tea.  Overall the meal is good.  I wish Mcdonald's had more grilled chicken options.  But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good"	5 stars
23576	"They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile.

This needs attention Immediately to earn the people's business."	2 stars

Alt Spgs McDonald's (on 434 by Walmart) is just as bad with their machine being broken numerous times. Very frustrating.	3 stars
23606	"I'm not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can't find anything positive. This branch is the slowest I have ever been to . It never gets my order right , no matter how simple I made it. The burger's condiments were all wrong . The fry's were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour.  Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate."	1 star
23607	There has never been a single time where I go here at night and it                           s open. Not once. Says it             	1 star
23608	I felt bad for the employees. They were obviously stressed and the manager seemed to be hiding from the irate customers. It took 20 minutes to get food at 4pm on a Monday.  I was given the wrong sandwich and the fries were hard.	3 stars
23609	"The manager in the morning is awesome, the older Hispanic woman at the front counter gives exceptional customer service, you can tell she genuinely likes her job and is happy. Food was hot and fresh, and the coffee was just right. Will definitely come back to this one!"	5 stars
23610	"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive."	1 star
23611	It                           s a hit or miss with the people that work here. Some are great and friendly. Others need an attitude adjustment. Sometimes 	3 stars
23612	Cold fries. Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  The m&ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out.  $18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter. Then subpar at best.	2 stars
23613	Slow getting orders out 12 minutes for McDbl/ fries which where Luke warm.	3 stars
23614	"I usually go to this location, mostly as drive thru. Never have a problem with food, service or wait. This last visit went with the family a group of 7. And order inside the lobby was clean, the staff was friendly. The gentleman that took our order failed to charge as a large meal so we got a medium and when an item in our order was missing Minerva quickly corrected the error. In addition Minerva walked around the lobby checking in on guests including us. That      "	5 stars

23617	"Very unsatisfied, order was wrong. Management correct my order. Just gave me an extra fry and dismissed me. Will not be returning. My money is just as good at burger King. I understand that you are short-handed, but that should never compromise customer service."	1 star
23618	"When I approached the window the gentleman cashier just looked at me. I said, ""Hello"", and he did not speak. I handed him my card and he took it as if he were frustrated. When he handed the card back to me I said, ""Thank you"" and he said nothing back. I'm not one to usually make a big deal about things. I try not to be ""that person""; however, the way he acted was so unnecessary. Maybe I reminded him of someone, I do not know and never will know. I just refuse to go to this location again.

23619	Went there tonight around 11:15 and the drive thru worker didn                           t have his headphone mic off and just kept cursing saying this is                            bull****                            and kept on.

23620	The line on the drive through is very slow and long. So i decided to go inside. It is friday night. On the door states lobby open untill 12am. They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.	5 stars
23621	It was good. I asked for my stuff to be hot and they did. I feel like regardless at lunch time 12pm stay busy. But this location is so far the best to me. Everybody loves McDonald's and I don't know how some people could do this everyday it's been so pricey it's crazy I can only maybe do it once or twice a month when I have to for work.	3 stars
23622	yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back . I'm happy I don't work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong . and you pay for not what you get its sad we can't afford to pay for sonthing we want. and get ripped off. let's do better guys. if you don't like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job .	1 star
23623	"Today visit was the worse . Other stops they forgot things or wrong in my orders, forgetting hashbrowns , wrong  items drinks made wrong. But today it took the cake, The work took a couple of minutes to take are order . Then when we got are order my wife check it, all the items where there . But only 2 ideam that where right was the hash browns and a sweet tea . Order a #3  Bacon egg and cheese biscuit or hash Browns and sweet tea 2nd order was a sausage egg mcmuffin with a hot chocolate. We got a sausage muffin with cheese and a sausage muffin with a hot chocolate that my wife said it was not drinkable . If you ask why didnt we take it back . We dont have time drop the wife off at work then i get on the road to go to work . Dont think we be going back to this McDonald's its becoming more of a disappointment then a enjoyment."	1 star

23625	I felt really sick after eating the fish fillet sandwich. They made me wait a long time at curbside for my sandwich and fries. I assumed it will all be fresh. How wrong was I. Disgusting sandwich and stale fries. Never returning to this location again.	1 star
23626	"I ordered a kid's meal that took 14 minutes to receive,  they claim hash browns are not a lunch time item even though it's on the all day breakfast menu claiming it took 12 minutes to cook a hash brown worst location ever"	1 star
23627	"I came here at around 11pm last night, I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal, 2 cheeseburgers, and I asked for the fries fresh. I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds."	1 star
23628	The worst place to eat. Go there only if you have 3 hours of leisure time & you dont mind waiting 45 minutes to an hr to be taken care of. Only one manager & too many rookies are uncapable too supply the high demand.	1 star

23631	"Worst McDonald's in the area. After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window, for them to inform me that they were closed. Mind you this was at 1:12 am Saturday morning. The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 a.m not 1:12 a.m!! Clearly management didn't want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing. Will never go back to this location."	1 star
23632	"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word. Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff."	1 star
23633	"The last in a string of bad experiences, I only received half my order and it was still wrong. Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible. Won't be returning"	1 star
23634	"With all the issues that almost every business is experiencing...major shortages of both food and employees.. McDonald's seems to be the only place that has managed to keep it all together and do things right! Employees at this location are always efficient, professional and pleasant."	5 stars
23635	"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again."	1 star
23636	"Went through the drive through, nothing to complain about. But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there. Too many fast food places in this area are like that though. Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they'd be happier. Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too? Yeah I think so!"	4 stars

23638	Horrible McDonald's I had visited this McDonald's in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor. How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign? or just tell me politely to watch my step. I would've kept coming to this McDonald's but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired.	1 star
23639	Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window. It's awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag.	2 stars
23640	"Today at approximately 2:20 I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me - give it to me now, in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly, she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries, now if you could give me a feedback, because it really is not the way to serve the customer"	1 star
23641	"Ok, so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets, I personally prefer the Wendy's spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting. The McDonald's Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone, add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat!!! But mine were extremely dry and hard, one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting, I can say I tried them but I was not impressed."	2 stars

She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again.

23650	O came through the drive though and the guy there was so nice such a pleasure to be around you could tell he definitely cared about his job to the point where I actually gave him a tip at the window he ended up selling me to buying more than what I anticipated then I got home and of course behold my food was incorrect called back spoke to the manager the manager said absolutely come back in and we will correct it which I did and steaks happened came back through the drive-thru a new manager was absolutely wonderful it's how you handle something that makes it worth going back or not. Mistakes happen.	3 stars
23651	Always get my food fresh and never mind waiting. This location is so convenient! It is always clean and well maintained inside and out. I only gave 4 stars because the staff is hit or miss. Most of the time there is a very nice crew when I go. Sometimes there   	4 stars
23652	Today visit was awful. Food was stiff and luke warm and was missing some items  when I asked for it to be remade Joann the manger argue with me about it. I shouldnt have to argue to get hot food I paid for. Im back to update my review I originally gave my visit a 1 star. I got an email from Bre Williams the general manger she invited my family back and insured this is not how her store operates. Showing care for the customer goes along way. Thank Mrs. Williams for reaching out .	5 stars

She said out loud, in front of customers ""ends at 1030, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT"" No everyone DOESNT know that, some serve it 24/7. She continued to berate me."	1 star
23655	For fast food this McDonald's is better then average. I think it is probably due to the staff. There is a young girl named Carissa on the Am shift who is excellent. She sees us come in the door and has started our coffee ( we always stop on the way to work). She runs around the restaurant ' topping' off your coffee . We always know when she is working the restaurant is neat and clean. Thanks Carissa for starting our day off with a smile	4 stars
23656	"The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare. We have coupons with the McDonald's app. The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them, because she was tired of having to ring then up. My wife and I went to the restaurant today and, she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all. I'm going to try and avoid this McDonald's in the near future."	2 stars
23657	"Super rude. Suppose to be 24 hrs and they acted like ""how dare i eat here"" at like 2am. The worker never even spoke to me just took my card and shut the door on me didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup."	1 star

23688	"Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida. If I could give 0 stars that would be more suitable.  They mess up orders they're the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar. They dont understand what ""light ice"" means and you're going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons. Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money, any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for. Take it from a local, stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money. I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to. This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida. Please do yourself a favor and go to any other McDonalds to get the experience you deserve."	1 star
23689	Cashier Jamesha mocking customers laughing in their face. Moving very slow. At her own beat. Very rude. If I were apart of the Wright family she would definitely not be apart of my family business. I was in drive thru for 25 minutes before parking and coming inside all to witness the foolery which has the line backed up in the first place. However Jamesha is the only one who had a name tag on. Everyone looked over worked and under paid. Very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also as I'm writing this review waiting my order it's been 35 minutes here total. The manager sets the tone and she is even slower. Her walk expresses she's lazy	1 star
23690	"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness."	2 stars

Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting. As we stood there, we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders. The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things. Worst visit ever."	1 star
23692	"Horrible service. Drive thru speaker was not lit up/broken and when I pulled up to order, I was greeted rudely. I asked if I could order at the window and the lady said ""i guess so."" My order was also wrong and the bacon burger came with no bacon. BAD place to visit during a 3rd shift!!"	1 star
23693	The food at this store is always done right. They seem to run a good kitchen. Things are served at the right temp and 99% of the time taste great. Unlike other stores where you've got about a 60% chance of great food.	5 stars

23697	"There always seems to be a rush and not in a good way. Obvious rush hours are meant to be hectic. But when most of the staff are young and  teenage-ish  and rightfully so because age and mindset it a bit understandable.  But not getting right items with orders, or taking longer the should be to get final order is saying something. Having work in the Food & Beverage industry for numerous years in various positions  I Sympathize. When an Iced flavored coffee is made so sweet  with Syrup it's undrinkable that's not acceptable nor is  Appreciated."	3 stars

23700	"Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.

23703	The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.	2 stars

I normally get the turtle brownie sundae, a very delicious treat."	5 stars
23705	"Pretty much the definition of ""meh"" and ""ok"" service. Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful. She had the worst ""I don't care"" kind of attitude. Worst yet,  I believe she was the shift last or manager.

Either way,  if you don't care for the customer service, the food is usually on par."	2 stars

24122	"Disappointing. McDonald                           s is my standby for fast food. Normally I get consistent food with decent, sometimes amazing service. I know it                           s not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review"	1 star
24123	For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald's it's the biggest and the best. If you're looking for customer service not a chance.  You're better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order. I'll recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children.	5 stars
24124	"This McDonald's was awesome, I've never been to a McDonald's where the service was so good and the food options were amazing                                           "	5 stars

24127	The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.	5 stars
24128	I put in an order for in-store pickup but didn't realize that the dining room closed at 12. The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly. Great customer service!	5 stars
24129	"Visited the 'world's biggest McDonald's on international drive. Pizza and burger ordered were great, however, had to wait over an hour for food as it was so busy. Pizza also came first, (table delivery) and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly. Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes. Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked. Overall good was fine, but service poor due to being so busy!"	3 stars

24131	We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here. The food and service times are not the same as it used to be.	1 star
24132	"They would do a lot better if they didn't park every car in the drive thru. I know they do this just to make their drive thru time look better to the higher-ups, but it absolutely ridiculous . Simply process your orders faster and give customers their order. Every time I've been parked, I've ended up waiting 5-10 minutes! When I'm only ordering 1 or 2 combos, it makes it a little asinine."	3 stars
24133	Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open	1 star
24134	Ordered thru the app which was a quick and easy process. Mcflurry and shakes were broken and unavailable at the time of visit. Parked in curbside pickup as drive through line was long. Quickly and accurately received my order.	4 stars
24135	I visited this location 5/5 at 5:07 pm. The 2 young ladies (black and Hispanic) that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires. When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go. First and last time visiting this location. Smh customer service training needed asap	1 star
24136	"didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago, i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald's app code to get the points, i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald's app code to another car order( my card is linked to the app ) and I ended up paying for their food, i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said, yeah I think that car  is using my code , the guy just said "" is your lucky day go to the next window ""  It was late at night so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice. Tried calling but they didn't solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review"	2 stars
24137	"The manager was rude, I waited for more than 40 minutes, understanding that they were busy.  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed.  The worst customer service, additionally, tells me that my refund will be from 5 to 10 days since after 45 minutes waiting.  It only said that there were many orders."	1 star
24138	"Friendly, fast service.  Kiosks made it easy to place your order.  The food was delicious and hot.  Very busy location, but hardly no wait. The dining area was nice and clean."	5 stars
24139	"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one."	1 star
24140	2 adults ww children breakfast meals. Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal. Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere. Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter. Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat. No apologies were given!!!!!	2 stars
24141	"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs"	1 star
24142	Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.	1 star
24143	"Went through the drive-thru and had a pre-order. They rushed us through, they were busy, then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong. Not even worth going back for. It's happened multiple times at this location."	2 stars
24144	"It was a clean and convenient location, but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered.  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard, no pickles, no onions.  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder.  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car, she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food.  She made no effort to offer the food.  She made us get it where she was.  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there."	2 stars
24145	Always friendly staff. Fairly clean and food to order. Shout out to all workers and managers!	5 stars
24146	They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.	2 stars
24147	Rude staff.  Slow food delivery.  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted.  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up.   Food quality is poor.	1 star
24148	"Atmosphere is cool and unique. Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks. The wait time was forever, service was definitely slow. But it was also Easter and spring break weekend. But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating."	2 stars

Busy night, but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of counter, and pay. Cool, since in Georgia they haven't caught on at many yet. Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon, pickles, and cheese, and a large fry. Service was great for me. They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and bathrooms. Enjoyed the experience. Went back for dessert, but paid at the counter, and let them know we appreciated the service."	3 stars

24155	Being in the area this is a must see place. Had a great meal overall. It was busy but got almost all our food very quick but the pizza. Quite understandable that the pizza would take longer but the only thing is that by the time it arrived my fries were almost cold. No big deal but they should keep that in mind. Other than that the pizza was great and service was good. I                           ve worked McDonald        	5 stars

However, even though we had a big order everything was in the bag. The food were also hot and fresh."	3 stars

24158	"Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait. I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door."	2 stars
24159	Went through the drive-thru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged  for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me.

The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund.."	2 stars
24161	"Arrived at the McDonald's at 10:20PM, and the posted hours said the location was open until 12:00AM. An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn't let us in until we mobile ordered, although another employee seemed confused by this. Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed (again, even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM). Additionally, while this happened, there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating, and there were empty tables."	1 star

This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe.              "	2 stars
24163	We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team. What an experience. There's a lot of different food options including PIZZA! The place is amazing. If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place. Unbelievable.	5 stars
24164	"Great Mcdonalds! Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs."	5 stars

The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window.

She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.

Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

It's almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted.. save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did!"	1 star

Deal on a large iced coffee was very good though. Also some of the staff especially this nice elderly lady was pleasant."	3 stars

24256	"My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation.

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up."	5 stars

The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went."	2 stars
24263	"Although conveniently located to several hotels, the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage. They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located. Even when we were at the window, it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together.

24265	@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.	1 star

Not only did I have to wait an extended period (three to five minutes) at the order board but we had a large order.

24283	With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child. Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast. If you don't get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry/hard biscuit. I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone. There goes almost ten bucks.	1 star

My issue came with the TWO managers that were ""taking care of the guests"". Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about. I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it. These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn't work weekends.

24307	Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food. Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow. The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70's bring the food out. She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in. No offense she was a sweet heart just worried.	2 stars

The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD's number to complain. I am local so I have choices to eat at other places. You know what Wendy's is sounding a lot better these days. It's not even a short staff problem, its a I don't care problem. I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others. losing my $45 order each trip wont hurt then in the short term.

The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store. They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast.

I knocked on every door wondering if anyone was going to open up the door, but no. The worker shook her head at me sternly and wouldn                           t even give me the explanation as to why she wouldn                           t open the door.

24335	I can't even give them a star.  We had to order 4 times after sitting in line for over 45 mins- they still got it wrong.  Their team needs training severely.  We ended up working with the manager and he did give us the food free- spouse and teenage found it inedible.	1 star
24336	"This particular McDonald's was incredibly slow.

My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they didn't put the pickles on it.

Overall it took over 15 minutes in the drive through to get my food.

When I CALLED THE STORE AND ASKED THE MANAGER HUNG UP IN MY FACE 2 TIMES. WHEN ALL I WAS ASKING WAS WHAT TIME DO THEY CLOSE AND WHY DOES IT SAY 24 HOURS IF YOUR SHUT DOWN?!?!?

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE, SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO!!!

THESE ARE THR MANAGERS ACTING LIKE THAT ? IM FAR BEYOND DISSAPOINTED AND I WILL BE STILL REACHING OUT TO COORPRATE.  THEY DONT DESERVE THEIR JOBS AT ALL, SOMONE ELSE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT JOB AND TREAT THE CUSTOMERS PROPER ."	1 star
24340	"Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce, due to a dairy allergy. When I got to the pick up window - they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches. I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected.  Unfortunately, this happens constantly, no matter what McDonald's I go too. It's clear the prep team simply isn't paying attention to the instructions on the orders."	4 stars
24341	"If I could give 0 stars I would. We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated, ""we are short staffed and really busy, we can't take any more orders for 20 minutes"" and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru, they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out. I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders, thats understandable, but telling people you're not taking orders for the next 20 minutes.. I mean come on, I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business? Seems like a poor business practice to me. This happened on 10/17 at 1030 by the way."	1 star

24346	My family and i had come to Orlando for the weekend only so since Sunday morning we were ti head back to Miami. We wanted ti get ahead of the traffic so we decided that we would order breakfast and eat as we traveled and McDonald's was our spot. The lines were long but it moved pretty fast and we were happy. I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great.	4 stars
24347	This mc Donald's is self order only. And the self order board wasn't working properly? So it made for a lengthy wait. They don't have any cash sale lines? It seems they only want drive through business.  As far as the food.....well you know what your gonna get here!	3 stars
24348	"This place is terrible!  They have no inside seating...  which, I guess happens.  But the manager on duty this morning, when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear...   shameful...  we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm.  The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order.

24350	"Incredibly slow service, sat in the drive-thru for at least 10 minutes without the line moving. When I finally got my food, the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale, the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all; on top of that, I wasn't asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces, the sandwich didn't have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it, just oddly dry pickles, and a soggy bun. I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.
I only stop at McDonald's if I am blindingly hungry, on the verge of passing out, and still my past 3 experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting.

Update: Got food poisoning, and this is the last thing I ate."	1 star

24352	It's fast food so its hit or miss. Often the fry grease tastes old. The Tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to syrup. Half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully cooked. Other times its great?	3 stars

24368	"We waited for 50 minutes in the drive through. The line moved at the beginning, but then stopped completely near the order box. Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldn't escape. We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait. It was very frustrating.

24375	They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift.

24383	Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.	1 star
24384	Service at this place is a joke. Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food. The tea is bad 60 percent of the time. I believe this falls directly on management. As there are always new employees there. Most times having poor attitudes. Also I have never once been suggested a pie. I don't even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer. And probably be un edible. I only stop in there maybe once a month when I'm in a bind.	1 star
24385	I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center. I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonald's and grab some food. Boy was that a mistake. I arrived at this McDonald's at 11:45. I did not order my food at the drive-thru window until 10 minutes after 12:00. By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 12:30. This has to be the absolute slowest McDonald's in the history of any restaurant in the world. It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane. They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one. Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building. But they were slower than molasses. I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one.	3 stars

24387	"I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone.

It's been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald's has definitely gone downhill. Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money.	2 stars

When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was.

24422	Ordered curbside. The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take 15 minutes and he couldn't cancel it. He said he can substitute for cookies. 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie. Frustrating. Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct	2 stars
24423	We're here the other night about 2:00 a.m. they're very kind and considerate the fries were a little late so they offered me an extra set plus the ones that were not bad in my opinion but may have been a minute older so thanks to them and their service and tasty food	5 stars
24424	"Sign on door says drive thru open 24hrs and there is signage under the McDonald's ""M"" by the street that says open 24hrs. They are NOT 24hrs, they open at 5.

24425	"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed."	1 star
24426	"Nothing bad to say here! We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks. We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order. It also seems to give you a little more time to order. The place was very clean and modern in design. We didn't interact too much with staff but the little we did, they seemed very nice and helpful. Although not used this time by us, I did notice a cart specifically for sauces, seasonings, etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked.. the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues. Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience!"	5 stars

Trash bins over flowing, tables dirty, self help machines missing table locator, and drink dispenser area was messy. From what I could see, the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a wreck.

Back to the self help machines, it states that they will bring you the drink to your table. They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front. I don't really care but someone should change what the machine states.

Overall, this is a modern looking McDonald's. Most of the days I went here it has been good. But I guess their weekend was a different story."	3 stars
24439	The cashier/servers look miserable and when you smile they just straight up look at you like youre vermin to them. They lack personality and they rudely say stuff.

24441	Well just because that McDonald's is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesn't give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I won't bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because you're on international drive don't mean you can rip people off and that's all you're doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices	3 stars

I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly	1 star

Worst service ever"	1 star
24447	If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it. This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get. What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 30-40 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal?	3 stars
24448	"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me."	1 star
24449	No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long. Would recommend over McDonald's entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher.	4 stars

Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.

24459	"I never thought I would rate a McDonald's as 5 stars but I did. Food was typical of a McDonald's but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant. They smiled, checked up on us, cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations."	5 stars
24460	"On Saturday, at 11:25am, drive through is moving at 4 to 5 minutes per car, which works out to about 30 to 35 minutes to get your food from when order was placed. Also, only use lane 1 and you will go faster."	2 stars
24461	"The worst McDonald's in the area. I have lived close to this McDonald's for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience. My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable. Also the team members and management just don't seem  to care. I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold. I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave ... I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items. With that said I will not be back to this McDonald's location ever."	1 star
24462	"Great food. Not speaking English at the drive-through window is a big downfall for me.  Not sure why they would put somebody like that taking orders. I repeated myself three different times and then they finally brought somebody else to the window. Very frustrating

I mean I know it's just a starting job for some people, but they still need to be professional."	3 stars
24464	This place was freaking unbelievable!  It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins.  The food was good. I had the broccoli and                                      Alfredo. I do recommend it.  The large fish tank in the middle of the floor	5 stars
24465	The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met! Tasha was the sweetest worker there! The food was good and as isially good price.

24476	"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement."	1 star

Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service.

24510	Very busy here at night maybe a good 20 mins to get u food	4 stars
24511	"Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits. If you can go a few miles down the road, the Sand Lake location on I-drive is much better."	2 stars
24512	"This Mc Donald's it's always really slow. Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever. I'm already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing. It already happened sometimes, I will not come back to this Mc Donald's anymore. Terrible customer service."	1 star
24513	Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order. Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line. Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in. When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call	1 star
24514	"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered 3 items. 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item - a double cheeseburger. By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order.  30 mins later! Walked out with barely an apology. Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel. Avoid if you can, don't expect if you cannot."	1 star
24515	"Normally visit this location 4 out of 7 days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early 530am. On 4/21/19 the frappe machine is down for cleaning at 5am, and now on 4/22/19 the system is completely down. It's becoming a place that isn't dependable."	1 star
24516	Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.	2 stars
24517	"This has got to be the most improved McDonald                           s in the area. While the others are slowly deteriorating, this one maintains its beauty!! Everybody is always working hard and the inside is so clean. If it takes long that just means they        "	5 stars
24518	What a horrible experience. I sat at the front counter for over 15 mins for utensils and sauce on Dec 21st at 9:45pm. The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up. Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that. This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad.	1 star
24519	"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando."	1 star
24520	The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location	2 stars
24521	What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes. The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct. We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected . When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it. When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut. The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt. He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes. Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another.       	1 star
24522	"Horrible service- stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 6.00 for my food. Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others, workers were in back play fighting. Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line. After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away. She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food. Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds."	1 star
24523	We shouldn't  even be waiting for fast food more than 40 minutes . For order of chicken nuggets. Please . Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks . I mean i know fast food   isn't easy but damn 40 minutes really give me a break. Staff is extreamly slow. Won't  be back.	1 star

24526	Horrible food.....bag the  chicken sandwich came in had a disgusting almost like a gasoline smell.....and the sandwich was not warm at all....and the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting around for a very good amount of time....I threw it away immediately and spit out the bite I had in my mouth....disgusting... disappointing...and I stopped visiting the McDonald's on hwy 29 Cantonment because of bad food and sloppy service...and this one on pine forest rd Pensacola..will be on my McDonald's never to visit too......	1 star

So, I stop by almost every morning and have come to realize their apples pies are often hard as a rock. This is becoming to be a real problem at this location.

24529	"This location gets super busy, but the staff seems to take it all.in stride. They are all very nice and polite. I had a good experinece here and would go back, even though they forgot the pickles on my cheeseburger. That makes the McDonalds Cheeseburger."	5 stars
24530	"Although McDonald's chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery, however this outlet is different.
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers.
Moreover, they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages. Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment."	5 stars
24531	"If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would! I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids. Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15+ to get our food. Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The sad part, I didn't have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered."	1 star
24532	"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality."	1 star
24533	"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with."	1 star
24534	"Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald's. Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 10:13 pm..waited and waited..drive through backed up, 20-30 people inside waiting, absolute chaos. Finally at 10:47pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave. Literally 35 minutes for coffee. Horrible experience, short staffed and totally out of control."	1 star
24535	"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book. Coming from a long time McDonalds customer, I wont be back again."	1 star

24541	"Don't know why, but ever since the rebuild of this site, the burgers are unbearable. Never juicy, dry and unfavorable as can be... From the little burgers to the quarter pounder, it's the same. Doesn't even taste like meat anymore. They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months, but we'll over a year now, and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard. What happened?"	2 stars
24542	I love this McDonald's.  It's across from Hilton Orlando.  They got good deals for breakfast and during the day.  The quality is amazing.... Way beyond what I expected.  The McCafe drinks were so good...not water down like those in NYC.  I am giving this place 5 stars if you want cheap meals that fill you up!!!	5 stars

24545	"It was already a bad experience from the moment I met the window attendant at Pickup 1.  She told me we ran out of eggs and just left me there at the window without telling me they were making more. Then she came back s few minutes later and handed me my food(Big Breakfast which is supposed to come with OJ) and I asked for salt and pepper and she said it was already in the bag, which it is NOT, and then shut the window in my face. The meat wasn                           t fully cooked and the eggs still runnie. I walked in to find out she is the actual manager. I told her I was about to shut the window in my face, I was gonna ask for Ketchup. She then snarkley replied I didn                           t shut the window in your face!

She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished. Never said hello or thank you.
Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease.

24559	"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn't give it ZERO!
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald's because the counter line was too long.  Come to find out it's because the kiosks weren't taking payment?  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food.  When I asked for a refund for my friend's food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said ""it's coming.""  Uh, no!  Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead.  Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonald's!"	1 star

24562	One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.	1 star

I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly. Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait. I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say. Terrible location, regardless of how busy it is, it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty, dirty tables, and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude."	1 star

24603	"This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place. We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter. THEN they only brought 1/4 of our order. Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments. Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter, he was told to ask someone else. Really? You want $15/hr for this? I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn."	1 star
24604	"So I never thought I would be reviewing a McDonald's,  because well its McDonalds.  However, I was in town for a conference and grabbed a quick lunch in between sessions.  The food was typical McDs, but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful.  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often, but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one.  Greeted as I walked in, ordered from kiosks, food delivered to me, staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left.  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all.  Cheers."	5 stars

24606	Super slow to get food.  It appears drive thru got all the attention.  15 minutes to get food is too long.  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price	2 stars
24607	I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.	2 stars

24615	"New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful. Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink. Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn't broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike?"	2 stars

When finally making to window to pay, they couldn't 'find' my order.  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando,  they completely failed the meaning of fast food."	1 star
24631	"Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things.  This morning around 12:28 am 11/24/18 when asked the very standard "" may I see the food allergy menu"" or since that wasn't available, ""would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead"" the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee.  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.  Zero stars...would not recommend."	1 star

24656	"Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter, a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun. Paid for my order and waited. When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bag.I asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal. First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer, but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries. I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box. I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh. Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonald's is known to deliver."	3 stars

24681	"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place."	1 star

I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately (couldn't be bothered to make any verbal response) but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant. You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy sound(young, black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect).
What ever the main manager, Stephanie is being paid isn't enough. I saw her run, rule, command the show in a way that got the job done. She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits."	1 star

They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu"	1 star

24886	"Terrible terrible service. Whether they                           re forgetting online orders, or not including items from orders in the drive thru,"	1 star
24887	"Checkout took forever.  Only 1 cashier. Didn't  receive my drink cup, had to ask for it, as well as the size, also staffer didn't  give us the milkshake ordered. No sense of Urgency. They need to be more like Chick Filet. I heard several ordered after mine weren't  right. Disappointed."	2 stars
24888	"I ordered and CLEARLY STATED that I wanted two sandwiches, four hash browns and two ice coffees. They only put me for one coffee. I told them I ordered two so they charge me for the other coffee.
I ask for my ""extra"" coffee they were confused and said that they ordered me an extra sandwich so they had to fix that and refund me and gave me my 2nd coffee. I finally thought It was fixed, so when I left and got to my destination, I realize this INUTILE a cashier only ordered me one hash brown instead of four. Moral of the story, McDonalds, either train your cashiers right or buy new equipment because a simple order shouldn't have taken me more that 10 minutes of my day.

This McDonalds is the ONLY truly well-managed McD's in NoVa in my opinion (and I've tried 'em all!), the only one that at least acts like it actually WANTS customers to come inside!  Things they do that other McD's often do not. 1) free coffee refills 2) power for laptops 3) USB ports 4) bowl of McD's breath mints at counter 5) ample parking 6) friendly employees 7) CLEAN 8) updated 9) don't push the awful ordering kiosks (16 screen touches to order a coffee?! - please) 10) very pleasant dining room, lots of windows and sunny, and they clean the windows constantly 11) nice bathrooms w/ hot water 12) comfy padded seating.  I go out of my way daily to enjoy this McDonalds.  Well done!"	5 stars
24894	"1 hour ago at 11pm, we had 4 people, came to the restaurant but all doors were locked. We rang the bell, and one of the staffs pointed his hand to show us to the drive thru. We came there to wait about 15 minutes and no one answered us even though no one were in front of us and couples cars behind in line. We let a car behind came before us and she got no response, too. Terrible service."	1 star
24895	Best service I've encounter around here.  Lots of room and they keep the place super clean.  Employees do a great job at keeping the place clean and customers are served quickly with a smile.

24896	"Did the drive thru today (08/22/2020 approx 11:15 am) the drive through attendant (who I can only describe as a heftier young man) was rude when I asked for a burger in my daughter happy meal. Not to mention I specifically asked for no onions. Not paying attention to my order on the screen, I drove up only to find the lady trying to hand me 4 large ice teas in addition to my regular order. Confirmed on the receipt that I was charged, I was not willing to wait for further fumbling about for $4. I said don't worry about it, dont want the teas and don't care about the $4. I get home AND MY DAUGHTER'S HAMBURGER IS OVERFLOWING WITH ONIONS!!! Terrible customer service, terrible attention to detail, terrible experience."	1 star

The seating area, which had social distancing tables separated and identified, and the chain had been lowered so you could enter so I and my friend sat. After sitting for 2 minutes, a staff member, standing on the other side of the restaurant started yelling at us and indicated that we weren't allowed to sit there and that the dine in portion of the restaurant was closed. They need to work on their signage, it felt rude."	3 stars

Recently they started using better hamburger and it's like the good old days. Except now they carry your food out to you instead of waiting on the counter ."	5 stars
24907	"This McDonald's needs to improve.  The facility is good and updated. The food service is slow.  They also mess up our orders often, at drive-through, in particular. It appears that the employee turn-around is high, so I don't really see regular employees here for long."	2 stars

Also, have 2 boys and instead of explaining there are no boy toys, they just throw girl toys in instead.  Also... No sauce dispensers??? Now gotta open tons of packets? Down hill for sure."	1 star
24915	"I've frequented this McDonalds at least once a week for the last year. In times past, I was fairly ambivalent to it. It was just a place that I would go to get a quick bite to eat while I rushed off to some appointment or event.

But over the past few months, it has become so much more to me. I know the pleather seats like the back of my hand, I know the nuances of the quick-order kiosks, I chuckle every time I see that little piece of gum stuck on the side of the drive-thru wall, I know when the fries are being made fresh, I know and love that greasy sheen on the floor. It is comfortable, it is safe, it is home."	5 stars

No indication of nature or duration of the closure.  Hence cannot say if its permanent.  But they seem like they may be closed for a while.  No notice beforehand from staff or signs."	1 star

Is well lit, nicely decorated, and the staff is friendly."	5 stars
24921	"Every single time I have gone through the drive thru at this location, it has taken at least 20 minutes to complete the transaction. They have a sauce they're advertising on a poster at the drive through that says ""Honey"" sauce, but when you get to the window, no one knows what you're talking about.
Anyhow, the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we won't be returning to this location.
Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual, the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our (my husband and I's) nuggets aren't done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait. That's fine, as we do so without complaint. The manager comes out 5-10 minutes later to give us our food. We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, and not 20piece nuggets. That's not what we paid for or ordered. We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager; his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window, as I heard them yelling to him, ""They want to talk to you!"" countless times, as if he asked out of frustration and anger. After he was torn away from the slow work he wasn't helping with while in his office, he pretended he didn't understand what I said and said he couldn't write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didn't have some kind of coupon book? I asked him if he could give us  what we bought next time since we had already paid. He said yes and we left. Yesterday was the last day we visited this location; and we asked for the manager at the first pay window. He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our 20 piece nuggets that we were buying! He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it! You would think how much revenue, McDonalds brings in, the manager wouldn't be so stingy and would apologize and provide what's necessary to remediate the situation! He acted so snide and unapologetic too. Needless to say, experiencing slow service, disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities; we won't be returning."	1 star

This location features a play area as well. Our orders were correct. That is miraculous considering the multiple errors we normally see when placing fast food orders. We felt welcomed   "	5 stars

25315	"Cold Fries, missing food, wrong food, and no receipt for proof of purchase. This location just opened not that long ago and lack of detail on orders given is already a huge problem. If you want good reviews then pay attention to the people ordering your food. I ran a McDonalds so I know what was not done and the leadership and crew members need work on actually doing what they are both taught and paid to do."	1 star
25316	"Since it re-opened, I go for breakfast about once a week. Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonald's anywhere in the country -- its so perfectly crispy every time. My order has always been correct. The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long."	5 stars
25317	"We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience. Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves. Probably won't come back during our zoo trips anymore.   "	1 star

On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise don't even try it, because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT!"	4 stars

25323	"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies, but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies (sad face). As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonald                           s app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?"	1 star

25353	"It's a McDonald's with a Zoo twist. If you are reading this review, you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu. The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside. More importantly though is how efficient this location is. Every time I've been through I've seen a drive through 10 cars deep and watched them churn through everyone's orders in a matter of minutes. If only every drive through was this efficient."	5 stars
25354	I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars after my recent two visits (Mar. 2023). This McDonald's has gone through a major overhaul. Newly remodeled inside and out including employees.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work."	1 star

25372	"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years."	1 star

25377	When this McDonald's first opened. OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme. The animatronics made noise and moved. The service WAS excellent. But now it looks like a tourist trap. Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had. As far as the food goes. Well it's McDonald's same as any other.	2 stars
25378	Never get my order correct always something missing !!!!!	1 star
25379	Line is ridiculous. They need new and faster workers	1 star
25380	It's Only GOOD occasionally if I go in the morning their on point but lunch time is horrible they always forget part of my order or it's made wrong or my fries are too hard now usually I don't complain but all they do is send lil free meal cards but someone needs to know and correct the mistakes they know they can do better	3 stars
25381	"Staff was very rude, not the one at the counter but the manager was yelling at me to come get our food. Me being pregnant and just visiting the zoo, I was letting my husband get the food after he was finished getting the kids drinks as the lady continuously yelled at me to get my food! Very unprofessional."	1 star
25382	"Order was correct, but drive thru took long"	4 stars
25383	"I didn't eat here but stopped to use the restroom on the way to DFW.   It seemed clean overall.  I enjoyed the jungle theme.  It was inmersive,  right down to ""Lions"" and ""Lionesses"" on the bathroom doors!  Somewhat of a weird location just off the freeway exit, lots of construction in the area when we stopped by."	5 stars
25384	"Went to drive thru window at around 11:30 ish and employee with copper tone hair like was very rude and disrespectful I was gonna ask her a question about another order that I wanted added to my order and she rudely said no , when I get to th window I asked her if that was her that I was talking to she said yes talking about that there                           s only two employees working mind u it                           s customer service how hard can that be also wen I get my food and I get home I checked my food and it was spitt on my food , I understand that you guys ar                   understaffed but that is no way to give customer service I will be making sure that"	1 star
25385	Was blown away fast and fresh food was little bummed they took animals out	5 stars
25386	First I only added the 1 star because that's the only way to do a review                                     ... I  had 4 drinks so full they were spilling through the lids.. the woman at the window saw it spilling and still passed while they were dripping... guessing she saw a look on my face... this woman looked me in my face and said it's just a little bit... and closed the window                                     ... so I she came back to the window with half of my order... my son opened his cheese burger and looks like a arm hair... a eyebrow... or puuuuub (maybe                                    )... I asked for napkins she gave me sooo many napkins... I'm like you should've fix this before you gave it to me..                           i. worst of the worst experience...                                       	1 star
25387	Great people fast not mess up your order real pros to. The manager asked if my order was right! He's was great nice polite and friendly.	4 stars
25388	Rudest night crew I've ever experienced. The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional. All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers.	1 star

Becarefull with the food up there in the Zoo McDonald's?"	1 star
25393	I used to love McDonald's fries but not no more. You can't never really get anything fresh from McDonald's. I used to tell them could they make my McChicken now when they did it taste so much better. But everything is preheated or been waiting for you LOL	1 star
25394	"They where not friendly. The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt. Got to the 2nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot. Waited at least 15 mins before anyone came out to our car. Asked what we ordered....and for our receipt ..which we didnt have....
Finally brought our food out and 2 burgers where wrong..."	2 stars
25395	Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous. Great! Dine-in was not available yet. I am looking forward to seeing the inside. Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo.	5 stars
25396	My order was handed to someone else who IMMEDIATELY ATE MY FRIES! MGMT OFFERED TO REMAKE MY ORDER FRESH WHICH I AGREED. THE ORDER CAME OUT LESS THAN 30SECS LATER. I USED TO WORK FOR MC.Ds AND OTHER FF RESTAURANTS AND I KNEW THAT WASN'T RIGHT!! TRASHED THE FOOD.SMDH!!!0	1 star
25397	They actually have a play area which most McDonald's don't anymore.  We also loved the animals inside and outside	5 stars
25398	"New staff provide a fresh experience. The food is always fresh and in it's proportioned correctness. A large french fry will have more fries than a medium size. Imagine that. "" I am loving it""."	5 stars
25399	This McDonald's is right by my house and really the only reason I continue to go. Service is excellent but I'm missing something from my order every single time I go. Having to go thru the hassle of getting out and going inside really defeats the purpose of going through the drive thru	3 stars
25400	"Just avoid. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a McDonald's. I feel like you have to be trying to be terrible to be as bad as this location. There are other McDonald's close by, don't bother with this place."	1 star
25401	The best looking McDonald's I have ever visited. Located near the zoo. Friendly staff and fast service.	4 stars

25415	"I went there this afternoon with my almost 3 year old. The food was fast, made right the first time and was good. The staff was wonderful and the restaurant was clean and the animals were amazing. I could not compliment this place anymore. If we lived here we would go here a lot."	5 stars
25416	"Although they kept forgetting stuff,the ladies were nice and quick with our food. Super upbeat,love the environment!"	5 stars
25417	In drive through at 10:58 AM- tried ordering lunch. I was told they couldn't take my order. I told them I'd just wait 2 minutes... LIke the car ahead of me that took 5 minutes to order. No big deal right? Nope manager comes out and yells at me to move/pull around she didn't care... I just had to move. 1 car was behind me still ordering. Would have thought I was blocking a fire escape or something. By the time I actually got through the drive through (due to cars ahead of me) it was 11:01AM... Really smart move guys. I'll happily take my business elsewhere. No longer stopping by after zoo trips with the kids.	1 star

25420	"I haven't been to McDonald's in years and I was surprised how good it was. I have the southwest salad and it was great. I don't know if I would go back for another few years, but I was pleasantly surprised. Also the staff here was super sweet with my little girl to ask to trade in her toy from her happy meal."	5 stars
25421	"I work five minutes away from this store, so I go there all the time. Everytime I go there's a problem. This time my bun was so hard. The bottom bun. There's always something wrong. I worked for this same company for a lot of years,(swing manager). It's crazy. I've only got good service once or twice there."	1 star

25425	Very fast friendly service	5 stars
25426	"This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites. I like this location because the people are always nice, and the service is always fast. This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time."	4 stars
25427	"Worse Mcdonalds I                           ve been to! Took forever with my order even though it was super slow (2 cars in drive-thru), parking lot is full of trash, we ate in parking lot and I went inside for a refill on my drink and they said they don                  "	1 star
25428	"I've been going there for many years as they are close to where I live. They are consistently decent. They usually get it right, it's normally fairly fresh...it is McDonald's so... They do make a darned good cup of coffee, which is what brings me back usually. I generally think of coffee when I think of Mickey D's."	4 stars
25429	Worst people ever. The girls were being rude for no reason. The zoo theme outside is very nice but the customer service was the worst. We asked a question and she slammed the window on us	1 star
25430	Wow!!  Today I went through the drive thru.  The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon.   The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper.  When I pulled forward to the food pickup window.  I informed them and requested my receipt.  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card.  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared.  I brought to their attention about the overcharge.  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone.  I have been calling the entire day.  No answer.	1 star
25431	"Awful experience. It was 10:15 and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets. I order my tea in the drive through line. The line was pretty long. When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes, said they could only take cash. I said, what!!! I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word!! I said, for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea. She looked strange, and I said please let me speak to your manager. She spoke to someone, and the manager said no and wouldn't come to the window. AWFUL!!!"	2 stars
25432	"This was a good McD. They made a good product that wasn't smashed in a bag and thrown out the window. They actually salted the fries, that's a lost art anymore. And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles. Obviously a happy crew does better work."	4 stars
25433	"Not the best McDonald's I've been too. First off, it could have been cleaner, they needed to sweep the floors. Second, the staff weren't the friendliest. I went up to the register and the man just said not yet. Never greeted me or give me a reason. Then I waited like 10 mins then a lady took my order, she was a bit nicer. Then waited another 10 mins for my food to come. I get being busy but at least be a bit friendlier or tell me theres gonna be a wait"	3 stars
25434	I                           ve used the drive through only. Service is great. I love the outd	4 stars
25435	"Zari was absolutely incompetent! We specifically ordered 4 meals to be placed in 4 separate bags during the first stage of ordering (as they were for 4 people). When we requested this again at her window, she rolled her eyes, huffed, and began changing them out. She also gave me 3 Cokes and 1 diet Coke (for the diabetic in the group). They didn't mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one! Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health!"	1 star

25437	Well what can I say I use to work mc Donalds and their custermer  service  was great I went to drive through  tonight no one help me on the speaker so I drove  to the window the cashier tell no that will need to go back in line and order again that he could get my order at the window I was in line for good 10 15 mn then I go to  the window to talk to manger nothing and he just left to the back and ignored  the custermer in the front he was asking for him to get him something  he did not get any help he left I drove up then he was not there at all with a big line I went back to the drive thru and well to oder then he tel their is no ice scream so I get inline again for nothing had to stay in line until they served every one in front and again no one in the windows to help  but just the some  need to ck cause I have it all in video  I will posting it on line to she how horrible  custermer service  Mc Donald's  have compare to Chick-fil-A  they don't come close of the quality  and custermer service they have and people need to start speaking about  Mc how not only tge drive thru people wait for 20 to 30 mn some all the pollution but that's another story I hope this makes some ck this out	1 star
25438	I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened   	4 stars
25439	Just bought the new adult happy meal for a little over 10 per meal!!! Way to expensive.	3 stars

25441	"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return."	1 star
25442	"This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo. The staff is always friendly here, the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonald's in the area. Prices are typical of the food chain, service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food. Can't go wrong here, especially with the kids. They will love it."	4 stars
25443	"Doesn't deserve one star! Waited in line 30 minutes. When we finally ordered the girl couldn't get the order right after 3 attempts. When we got to the pay window, the girl was talking on her cell phone. When I asked her to repeat my order, she looked at me crazy. When we got our order it was disgusting. Soggy oily fries, burned chicken nuggets, water down soda ... plain disgusting. They need new management for sure!!! Someone please contact corporate!!!!!"	1 star
25444	"Very nice fancy ""CLEAN"" restrooms, that's a plus! Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children, just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat, jacket or purse. Overall it's a well managed McDonald's compared to others I seen. :) A-1 rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme! It's a tourist attraction. Thank you McDonald's for your professionalism in management and customer service. (Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat, jacket, diaper bag and/or purse, thanks!)"	4 stars
25445	These teenagers with bad customer service have the worst attitudes and are lazy. I bet the hiring manager is the same way considering her terrible hires. I wouldn                           t give this place one star. The only good person I                           	1 star

And yes I knw we all ate pretty much everything @ McDonald's, but these guys put there love into cause still to this day, I want another one...

Thank you!"	5 stars

I have to fix my order at the window everytime I go here, makes me think they mess up my order in the end just out of spite that, they think I'm changing my order every time I go.

Dear Manager

FIX/ REPAIR or GET SOME NEW EQUIPMENT PLEASE"	3 stars
25451	Worst experience ever. I pay for large fries and only fill it half way. I said if I want a medium I'll pay for a medium. Now fill this up or give me my money back. Service is just the worst I've seen. I really recommend people to not go there. Waste of time and will leave you with a headache	1 star

25453	"My wife and I was going to this McDonald's for some morning when they had another crew. But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew. Plz. change crew or train them better."	1 star
25454	"Would have have it a negative if possible. I have went to this location for the last time. Drive through you will sit at the speaker for 2 minutes before they even say anything to you but you can hear them talking/laughing/and cursing to each other. POOR MANAGEMENT. THEN, my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about 15 streks of ink on it nothing legible. SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn't effect her. If you are going to the Dallas Zoo drive further and don't let this McDonald's ruin your day. TRUST ME."	1 star

25456	"McDonald's is McDonald's. Consistent menu/ food quality. What sepates this location from other's is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking, getting it out quickly and keeping area clean. Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with  models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake, a  touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp. Great place to go with kids."	4 stars
25457	Well its very clean with good food.i recomend the number 6 mcgriddle	5 stars
25458	"Be careful with young children here! We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food. We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions, but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited. We asked her to leave several times, because it was very uncomfortable. She just continued to sit and stare at my neice. We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave.
Then the women's boyfriend called her back to his table, she left us and then they walked out shortly after.
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece. She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe. When we left they were parked next to our truck as well. We will definitely not be going back there."	1 star
25459	Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed. Every table in the play place was awful. (Ours had spilled milk). The employee took one trash can out but didn                           t pick up the trays and didn                           t clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor. What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk	1 star
25460	Terrible for getting rid of the zoo decor.	1 star
25461	Good food nice place	5 stars
25462	I'm guessing that this location is a training hub or something. It seems like it's always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go. Sheesh                                 	4 stars

I asked for a minute to see the menu. Then within a ""Second"" she asked if I was done with my order!  Sausage burritos had No Sausage. Orange Juice Cups Were Only Filled Half Way. Hash browns were cold ! By far the worst service ever! Your management needs to  work on their employees attitudes !"	1 star

25465	Passing through from a volleyball tournament.   Great tasting food with friendly service.  Had bagel nice and hot with fresh hashbrowns.  Definitely recommend if hungry and needing to feed a family fast on budget.	5 stars
25466	"Well it might have been ok, if I was not rushing, but I still stayed for my items. For this to be McDonald's, they should know that it's busier during certain hours then others..there were soo many ppl in line, the average person would have turn right back around n walked out."	2 stars
25467	The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins. Even after you've ask. Then soon as you drive away.  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to.	2 stars

25469	I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new	4 stars
25470	"I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there. Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault."	4 stars
25471	The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how it            	1 star

Service was relative quick but the store itself was quite dirty. Play place looked like it hasn't been wiped, and most likely haven't been sanitized. Bathrooms needed fixing and also dirty.  Hope management can quickly fix since parents want to come by for it's convenient location next to the zoo"	3 stars

I always count on this mc donalds not to mess up with my order but they ALWAYS do . Also they tell you to wait on the 1 or 2 waiting spot but never come out with your food . Today i ordered chicken nuggets and asked for them to be fresh , they were ok until i noticed that the chicken was BLACK inside one of the nuggets . Maybe was black inside of more of them and i didnt notice . I have picture proof as well . This mc donalds is just trash ."	1 star
25477	"Stopped in late around 1am but received good service, area  around drive thru was clean despite age of building and outdated signage for the play place but received order and the team member even placed an extra sauce I requested at the window in a separate bag instead of trying to shove 5 in my hand like most do."	5 stars
25478	"Neatest McDonald's I've ever been to (except maybe one in Roswell, NM), the jungle zoo theme is awesome. Food was good, service was great. Even gave us a free drink, very kind."	5 stars
25479	"Very Disappointed, 40 minutes to get my food due to short of staff per shift leader. No manager to get my money refunded. I've waited in the drive-thru. No apology whatsoever from that shift leader.  Will call coporate office myself.  My order was all screwed up."	1 star
25480	"I buy my drinks there. The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee. The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile , even the homeless. Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on (Robert B Cullom 75215 in South dallas) and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that !!!! As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me . Since I haven't heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald's"	5 stars
25481	"The drive thru took forever and it was 10p!! The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full 7 mins. Doesn't sound ridiculous until you're sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you. Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy's credit card, and started laughing about it. His co-worker was shaking her head saying ""it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long"" ...
To add insult to injury, I got my food, I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered, I left, and my food was cold and my order was wrong."	1 star

25485	"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that."	1 star
25486	"I eat at this McDonalds at least 4 times a week. Never again. The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not. Had to wait at drive-thru order 5 full minutes before giving my order. That's at the speaker, not in line. Was told (rather rudely) to wait several times. When given the order, the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared. When I got to work, I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware, no syrup or butter and not even a napkin. Calls placed to the store went unanswered. Poor service all around."	1 star

25488	Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!	1 star

I kept saying helloo hellooo helloo and did not even bother to stop talking. Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt. There was another girl next to her biting off her Acrylic Nails and was falling all over the table where the order computer were at SO DISGUSTING!

The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner. All in all, it's different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo."	4 stars

This was new and well it could be great or ruin my lunch BUT I took a chance aaand!!! Oh my goodness!!! It was sooooooooo yummy! I mean it was so yummy that I hardly touched my delicious fries! Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good! It made my day! I was happy the rest of my meetings and sessions. Normally it would be boring but hey my tummy was cheerful and so was I."	5 stars

The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donald                           s app was greater than the closing of the order.

I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken.

25964	"Biscayne Blvd., and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive-thru window with 4 employees (one who couldn't even understand or speak English), I made a complaint to McDonald's yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner's organization.  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is, and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs.  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski, CEO of McDonald's, as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's in Chicago.  They need to understand why McDonald's is doing so poorly; afterall, when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year, maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select, train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service. I will not be going to this, or any other, McDonald's again!  It was that bad.  McDonald's corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers.  The owner clearly must put numbers before people.  Horrible, horrible experience!  Will stick with Wendy's instead.  They have much better food and service!

04/05/2021 - As a follow-up to my complaint to McDonald                           s 1-800#, and the CEO, I did receive a written response and phone call.  Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation.  I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonald                           s.  I will add that although I had been to this McDonald                       "	1 star

There have been two vehicles in the drive-through before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience.

Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc.

I saw 2 buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here, on top of the regular customers and/or those that are traveling by cars. Just like those working at Mickey D's over the border in the Canadian side (mainly showing French), these workers only spoke English and weren't too thrilled about French-only customers. I used the app to place my order, which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more, since they don't have to deal with extra people face-to-face. My order came out in timely manner (even with tons of tourists flooding in) and the food was good. Staff was friendly as they get. Huge parki"	5 stars

The prices are good (as always). I highly recommend the dollar menu, in this case, 2 Mc chickens for only $4. The taste is very good! For the price of course. And the spicy one tastes even better. Service was very fast, but it can get very packed in the afternoon. Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well (it gets packed, too). Pickup available. The everyday McDonald's, but placed in a crowded and convenient spot. We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce!"	5 stars
26264	"I don't eat at McDonald's, but I do UberEats deliveries. I love this McDonald's because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesn't have one. This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there."	4 stars
26265	"4 consecutive weeks, Every Monday the dining room is not swept or mopped. They don't open at 530am. For the last month on Mondays they won't have orange juice. They say the machine doesn't work and they can't serve it. The cashier tells me Some other worker will squeeze the orange because it's freshly squeezed. I would understand one mistake, but it's occurring every Monday."	1 star

The place was not clean. Homeless people surrounded the place.  I will never go back and i have already told a lot of people that were headed that way."	1 star
26267	"What a unique McDonald's, love the structure. But, the only reason that why it's a low rating for me is because they sometimes get people order wrong. That's the only reason I have. Also this place is sometimes very crowded and busy."	3 stars

26270	"Waited in line for half an hour, and it seemed like forever at the pick-up window.  I asked if they were short staffed, and she said they were waiting on the fries. But when I got them they were cold. She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting"	2 stars
26271	"this McDonald's is more expensive than others in the area, and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them."	2 stars
26272	The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald's out there. The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable. My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio. They had the munchies I guess.	4 stars
26273	"Frequently at this location, someone is spewing toxic gases into the air, violating local laws (& humane rights; despite a security guard on site).
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction, such as 12-7=5; (because the US doesn't mint 3 dollar bills) and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike's g-string.
If this location has take out hours & dining room hours, that should be posted; on entry ways & online. Otherwise, we patrons expect to sit down, not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20+ minutes after opening. MGMT should schedule site & employee hours accordingly."	2 stars

26276	"It's McDonald's...by the pier.  McDonald's. In the wee hours (only time I go) it can be colorful with the occasional altercation/conflict, but they have security.  Never had a issue there.

26279	"Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonald's, it able to handle the busy times. In my opinion consider the customer traffic, however they waist no time getting orders, if you do not have a cloud following, then you should get what you want. Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time. I see they want you to enjoy your meal, in my opinion. In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time. I was satisfied!"	5 stars

26291	"No drive thru, enough parking. Crowded but fairly quick. They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving, not stuffy. Mask optional at the time (July/28/22). All employees were wearing masks. All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job. Bathrooms and tables clean.  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.
Didn't have to wait very long for my food. Less than 5 minutes."	5 stars

26298	"To be honest, I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D's for its coffee. I have to wake up pretty early, so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am. With that being said, I will also say that because of Santa Monica's influx of homelessness over the years, this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons. Most are nice, and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time; however, it's the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome. The staff tries to placate situations, but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday. So, if you can't handle, talk, be patient, and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day, the don't go here. I don't need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing. Bye!!"	4 stars
26299	"Full of homeless people not like I'm unaware of our global situation with homelessness, but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don't do it at this one. It doesn't have a drive thru, so order ahead for pick up, it does have self service ordering kiosk."	2 stars

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean. The staff there were also very hospitable, friendly, and alert. I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea, and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat.

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside. I haven't had McDonald's since 2012, so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it.

Everything was okay okay with me."	4 stars

Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest. Lord, You are my peace, my assurance and the love that I hold on to.Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more. Lord, I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love.
Be patient with others, but mostly be patient with yourself. Lord, help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections.Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy. Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute. That's happiness!God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others. Lord, let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me. I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate.
Use Jesus' as your example on how to live. Lord, You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future. Give us wisdom in our choices.Dear Lord, thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain. You don't want to see us suffer. You know the suffering that we face, and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end. In the midst, Lord, I believe that you are sufficient. I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness. In Jesus's name, amen"	5 stars

26334	"The new renovation it went through makes it look more modern! The ordering kiosks are perfect for the tourist that can't speak English or Spanish. It is very spacious! Please beware, not to their fault, the Homeless population can be a turn off to go their do to the fact that it's a hang out spot for them. I have no problem with that as long as they mind their own business and I do the same. One thing that I'm surprised about, No refills on my coffee? Really? That was one of the main reasons I went there for breakfast. Besides that, it's McDonald's we are taking about. Quick and easy meal compare to other higher price options around."	3 stars
26335	"There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff, but it seems that the issue has improved. My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons. They always get our order right, and the delivery is seamless."	4 stars
26336	"The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay, but the service was horrible. I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting, I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left. At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving. The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly."	2 stars

26338	It's a McDonald's that food is the same as every other McDonald's is decent didn't like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice	2 stars
26339	There was a psycho there but the guard tazed her	5 stars
26340	"Very nice, very clean.
Saw a guy come in who ""looked"" homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out. It was kind of impressive, yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn't all there.

Also, the men's rest room was very clean, however I'd prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers. I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser. I like to use paper towels to touch these things... especially the door when leaving..."	4 stars
26341	"This Black lady at cash register took my order fine, another black lady with dark blue shirt red brown hair served my food.
Minutes later I return one item was made wrong!
Same black lady asked her staff to fix it then she gave it to me without checking it and I find out that they did it wrong again! I took to her for the third time and then she asked her staff again to do it again!
Instead of making sure it                           s done correct! She proceeded to go help another customer which took her about 4 to 5 minutes when she knew I come first but she didn                           t care! I asked her again when she returned to her post where is my food and She got quickly defensive with me and refuse to get me a hot free fries since I had to wait too long for my order!
I throw away my cold fries and just proceeded to get the hell out of there!!
I am done arguing with these black or not black l management fault!! They just hire any one for the job and they don                           t pay attention to what goes on in thei"	1 star
26342	Wonderful beachside McDonald's on Santa Monica Beach... food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until 11 p.m.	5 stars
26343	Fine it's always busy place	4 stars
26344	Good McD centrally located and quick service.	4 stars
26345	We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes.  Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae.  Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat.  Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them.	5 stars
26346	"I usually give high reviews but not this time. The service is excellent. Fast and professional staff all the way. Truely representing McDonald's culture. Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location down. The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in there. The restroom door doesn't close as to see what's going on in there such as drug use I can only speculate. There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the restroom. So they carry a bad odor. It ruins the atmosphere. It's depressing. I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging around, not purchasing any food, and being loud and unruly. I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his composure, even as the homeless man escalated. It's a tough job, but it's getting done. The priorities are kept here. Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it shows."	3 stars
26347	"Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces (homeless and everything that goes with that), the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean, service helpful, and food good as always. We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids (no this, extra that), and each burger was put together exactly as ordered."	4 stars
26348	Bathrooms are very dirty and lines are very poorly organized. I was able to skip ahead of at least ten people that were ahead of me because they don't communicate the registers that are open to the customers. The booths in the far side of the restaurant smell like cigarettes. Food was served quickly and with good quality however.	3 stars
26349	So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonald's in regards to what I'm doing doordash. Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people.	1 star

26351	Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here.	5 stars
26352	"No different than any other McDonalds, except that it's in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach. It's surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast. Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast. Seating can be an issue on very crowded days. Over all good experience and not too bad."	4 stars
26353	"Really rude staff, too bad service. Avoid if you can. There are so many other better places to eat or drink around.
They would literally cheat you!"	1 star
26354	"Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location, we couldn't eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by. I understand they can't help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald's location then you should definitely avoid this location."	1 star
26355	This is a very convenient location. Probably the most affordable food in this area near the pier. It's usually very busy with foot traffic for the beach and the promenade. You will encounter all types from international tourist to local bums. It's fairly clean considering the large amount of customers. The orders are quick but be sure to check it before leaving. Not the most accurate employees	3 stars
26356	"This McDonald tourist city attraction restaurant is over rated by it's local customers.  During my visit to this restaurant, none of its employees had people skills or customer dissatisfaction resolution skills.  Its employees escalated its customers verbal complaints to verbal challenging arguments.  Without any complaint resolution."	3 stars

26358	"This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion."	1 star
26359	I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didn                           t even put the bacon on it (The bacon that I spend my money on) and now they didn                           t put the onion on it.	1 star
26360	"They always have a lot of staff in hand, specially on the week ends and at peak hours. You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier. This also means that there will be homeless there as well. I like to live and let live so I don't mind sharing space with my fellow man. With that said there is security at hand at all times. Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonald's with a smile. You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location."	4 stars

26362	"They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled, and they also gave us the actual orders we bought. All in all they were pretty fast workers. They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier. I understand that it's not always going to be clean there because, frankly, there's not much room to clean there most of the time. If I could give 4.2 stars, I would."	4 stars
26363	One of the nicest mc donalds	5 stars
26364	"We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner. The food was always made correct and fresh, however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult.

26369	It was crowded! Unfortunately they don't do refills here.	4 stars
26370	No dollar menu anything but drinks here! Even coffee is 2 bucks! The service is spotty and confusing at best! The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier....ultra poor planning on space for quality of service/business. There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless.	1 star
26371	They got the best breakfast here.	5 stars
26372	They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat. The problem is their smell!!! We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed.	2 stars
26373	"Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice. When you press for a certain soda, it runs water for a while. Too many homeless people. The only decent thing here is the food."	2 stars
26374	"Worst McDonald's in the world, that's a big statement but its the only one that fits.
I ordered breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches, my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier.

Save your money, go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible.
To clarify I'm not bagging on all McDonald's, I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible, my suggestion is to go elsewhere"	1 star
26375	The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing.. security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite...you can eat on the patio but not for long...	4 stars
26376	"It's McDonald's, cheap sustenance to keep on going. We had a couple burgers and fries and I can't complain they were alright when the price is taken into account. It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times. The restaurant itself was pretty clean, what you come to expect from a McDonald's."	4 stars

26378	We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside. Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup.. she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup.

Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating	5 stars

Now that it                           s December 2020, they are slacking, I guess they are having more problems with the homeless or druggies or drug dealers outside of their business, but twice in the last two weeks I got cold and half-cooked fries after 9pm.

Maybe because I                           m a gang stalking victim, this is happening.  REPORT ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE.

Parking lot entrance smelled like Pee, and the Patio tables were disgusting to the point I had to clean it myself and I STILL didnt want to touch it. And the patio chairs were so Uncomfortable aswell"	3 stars
26390	This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier. Inside is nice. They will also bring food to you that you won't see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonald's only a few times in my entire life.	5 stars

Especially, since the ""dining room"" is no longer open 24 hours.  No drive through. Sad. Literally, steps from the pier. The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks. The homeless aren't the issue.  It is the mentally disturbed , the hustlers  and questionable addicts. This is not a family friendly location.  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear.  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat.  No other business has these issues!  Not one.  Food?  No problems."	1 star
26396	"First thing that caught my eye was its employees, within the times I've stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark. Reason being is do to it's great customer service.

Would I get it again?  Yeah, why not?  Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go, quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second, third and maybe fourth?  Who knows, really?

26436	"Worst customer service ever. Manager is rude and racist. I have been there twice and have witnessed the bad training of employees. Manager in nightshift charge wont help out at all. And I witness how rude she was to some customers, and when I asked to talk to a manager she insulted me and turned me away .  Mcdonalds. You should take complaints into consideration. All those complaints from us the customers.  I'm afraid if I go again instead of a big mac I'll get a mcwhooping."	1 star
26437	My order was not completed because I asked for grape jelly and 2 employees gave me strawberry and said grape didn't exist at that store. When I told the head manager I was allergic to strawberries she apologized to me and said they have plenty of grape jelly and gave me 2. I also had no napkins in the bag so I had to come back.	3 stars

Ever since the men had come to this island,  it seemed like everything had gone wrong. Not just like God had abandoned them, but had an active hand against them. The coke here is always watered down."	5 stars
26443	The worst service ever... the people behind us got their orders but our order never been processed. We decided to cancel our order instead. The manager never apologized for that error.

26496	"My experience visiting this place was not good. It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service. This McDonald's offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things. I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it.  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem. The staff attention was not good. They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area. As a positive comment, I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait. My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry, with a large group and during busy times."	2 stars
26497	"This McDonald                           s is one of the nicest and coolest McDonald                           s I                           ve ever been to. It is a two story McDonald                           s with a play place and an arcade. They offer non traditional menu options, such as build your own pasta, ravioli, pizza, cake, cheese cake, etc. it truly is a one of a kind McDonald           "	4 stars
26498	"The aesthetic of this location was really cool. There is a huge arcade inside as well as play area for kids. Two floors, tons of seating, an aquarium and a bunch of other cool stuff. I was expecting a little better service and food quality with it being the largest McDonald's in the country. It was cool to be able to order pizza and pasta since that is not something typically available at McDonald's but as expected, it wasn't incredibly flavorful. Prices were a bit higher than normal McDonald's as well but with all the extras at the restaurant that makes sense."	3 stars
26499	"The World largest McDonald's is a must to visit if you have kids. Besides the typical menu items, you can order pasta and pizza, customized to order. The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty. Only downside is the wait for the food ... about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it. Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited. Overall a good experience!"	5 stars
26500	"Hands down best McDonald's ever!! We loved the game room.
The prices were so reasonable, $25 was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted.
They restaurant was clean, the food was fresh and staff was friendly. It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant."	5 stars
26501	"World largest McDonald's. Food is the same, they have pizza and pasta too. The seating and ordering process was quick and easy, but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge.

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so, but pizza took 30 minutes+ from the time when we ordered it. I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza.

Honestly, this worth a single visit, especially the playground if you have kids. If you looking for a quick bite, I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service."	4 stars

However, it                           s not among the best in terms of service quality! Long waiting for the order!

Highly recommend	5 stars

We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good."	5 stars

The place was a madhouse, but worth it for the experience. It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didn't let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area... I know, kinda mean. But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous. Definitely worth the visit, even for just a cheeseburger! And KUDOS to all employees, this place is NUTS! AND a drive-thru?! Bless y'all."	4 stars
26518	"This was a great experience. I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to. The pizza was really good, Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing.

I liked the food a lot. I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both. I also got a large fries a burger and drinks. Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places.

Only con:
I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast. Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it's like this."	4 stars

The place is huge - brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas, hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations, the everyday McDonald                           s kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade, playhouse and more sit down area.

Paid at the first window, drove to the second window, and employee says, ""You didn't pay for your food!"" Show the receipt and no apology or remorse, just ""oh?!"" Hands food to me. Last episode, shortchanged $20 of a $100 Bill. GM says next, we checked everything except what was actually take from the register and denies error in the transaction, but say I'll give you a free meal and dessert?!

26528	"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded."	1 star

26579	"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you? If not, please close your doors to save the public from the irritation."	1 star
26580	"What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either ""don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work"" or they ""smile and make you feel welcomed"". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake.  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm. The morning crew is a good bunch of workers, however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow."	1 star

26605	"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened."	1 star

There are people in the kitchen who occasionally come out to the counter to reluctantly help customers. No one is charge. It makes me wish we had a real McDonalds nearby. I left a cold order of fries on the counter because no one called out the order number. Never did get my hamburger. I'm giving them one star because the food is fine, if and when you get it."	1 star
26612	I stated at a near by hotel. This was the only thing around open late. Only the drive thru was open. The drive thru took 30 min. When it was my turn to order the cashier skip my lane and helped 3 car from the other lane first.	4 stars

At 4:00 p.m. there were about 3 to 4 times more cars lined up to get to the drive-thru than there were people inside. My food was fine nothing too positive or negative.
This IS a McDonald's- not your family BBQ."	4 stars
26631	"This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food. Thank you for having pride in the food you serve."	5 stars
26632	"Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building.  It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald's, and only for two egg McMuffins.

Just avoid this spot no matter what."	1 star

26635	"It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru.  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out. No one apologised for the abnormal wait time.

Especially for a fast food establishment."	1 star

She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag . I showed her the bag being empty ,and even made the comment. Even no ketchup.  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes, since my lunch is only 30 minutes, I had no choice but to leave."	1 star

26694	"Just ordered two large drinks and two large fries. Both drinks taste wonky as if the syrup in the machines are off. And to top it all off, they had me pull to the side to wait on 2 (TWO) large fries.

Won't recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonald's food/drinks. Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks, I'd hate to see what else they'd wreck."	1 star
26695	"Used the app to order, but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the counter. That's way too long. Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up. The only thing going for this place is that it's 24Hours drive through. And dont use the app, relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs.

Update: this place is torn down. The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing. I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll. Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty convenient."	2 stars
26696	Newly renovated. Not a McDonald eater. Had some free time so I decided to have a cup of coffee with pie. Loved it.	5 stars
26697	This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...	1 star
26698	Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.	2 stars
26699	"I had quite possibly my worst McDonald's experience ever here. After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin, the order taker said

""ok I'll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you.""

Um... Ok...

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

What the hell???

I won't be coming back here!"	1 star
26700	"Good location. I went in as the drive thru line was a little long, must be a busy area. I got my food quick, I only had to wait a couple of minutes, I was not even able to fill up my drink cup before my food was done. The staff was quick and friendly."	5 stars
26701	"I'm not sure what's wrong with this location, but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold. Today I went through the drive-thru and they had a rush, there were about 10 cars ahead of me. So I'm not sure how they can serve me cold food when they're constantly feeling orders. Just extremely disappointed with this location. I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder"	2 stars

26705	"First time to this location, came at night (between 10pm and midnight) and was pleasantly surprised how fresh everything was and made to order, the fries were fantastic and my GF loved the Oreo McFlurry.

Nasty personal,nigth time manager it's the more inefficient person to rule a place,no brain,incredible how this person work in a restaurant. Never comes back."	1 star
26707	All I ordered was 2 mcribs for $6 drive-thru. They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait. Ended up waiting 25 minutes before I got my order. They claimed the manager couldn't find me. It is a very small parking lot. The manager didn't try very hard. I ended up calling them to remind them about my order. They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy. The only explanation I got was we're so sorry. I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed. Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite. Lost my appetite.	1 star
26708	Bad Service Bad Attitude! Gave me the wrong drink and charge me for 2 sandwiches when I ordered one. I was in a hurry to the office (around 8AM) and I didn't have time to argue. When I got to second window and I was handed the bag and the window shut by someone who looked like she'd rather be anywhere but there. Terrible service.	1 star

26715	This McDonald's is garbage. Dirty. No soda. Only take orders from 1 of the 2 lanes. Nope.	1 star
26716	This is one of the best McDonald's. Place is clean and it gets quite a bit of traffic. Parking is tight but the drive thru(24 hrs) is short. The staff is mostly young professionals and they represent themselves well. Great fast food.	5 stars
26717	Little bit of a wait but that's pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces. The location didn't look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street.  It's McDonald's not a chic-fil-a  you get what you pay for	4 stars
26718	Nice clean location. Customer service was super friendly and professional. Nice seating available. Outside seating also available. This location has 24 hr drive through. Overall great experience. Keep up the good work!	5 stars

26722	"Every time I've eaten there I've never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table.  Always sticky and I've had  to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating.  I'd think they would at least watch and take care of this situation.   Also, very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast.   I've asked if they could turn the AC down a bit, but they said they couldn't.
Picking another MD now."	2 stars
26723	"Carlos, the young man running the front, was so friendly and all smiles even though he was getting overran and I myself was a bit of a problem for him as I had 5 kids who ordered 10 minutes apart from each other and changed their order twice. He still managed to take it all in stride and got us our food in a reasonable amount of time and with a smile on his face!"	5 stars
26724	"A little small for my taste. It is one of the older McDonalds, so it doesn't have outlets.
The staff is great, though! There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice, and it seems like he never has a bad day! None of the staff (as far as I have seen) discriminate against homeless people. Their humanity gets them the extra star!"	4 stars
26725	"Beware of the parking, it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located  very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded, if you are backing up you may have to wait or  even worse get hit by a car backing up (I actually saw this).  Not a big fan of McDonalds food, but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing.  My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar.  Service is always great."	4 stars
26726	"The drive thru girl lied to me and the mgr stepped in to assist and the next time I went there, I started out happy and said hi
She did not answer....wierdo!

Not cool to hold grudges.  I don't.  Every day, is a new day and a chance to clean up messes.  She could fix it and apologize but, she chooses to ack like a child!"	2 stars
26727	This place has clean restroom. The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park. The dining area is not so big but clean. The cashier was friendly and welcoming. I like that breakfast was served all day.	4 stars
26728	"I was there this morning at 10:00 a.m., thinking about ordering breakfast and coffee. The woman on the intercom wasn't really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time. I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong. I've never had an issue with this McDonald's but this was a first and disappointing"	1 star
26729	"Google keeps bugging me to review it, so here goes:    It's Mcdonald's. You know what you're in for when you go.  There's always a 50/50 chance that your fries will be hot and delicious, or cold and nasty.  I'll only add that this particular McD's suffers from being next door to one of the largest homeless encampments in LA.  Be prepared to be asked (usually politely) by a transient for food.
Of course, this isn't really the fault of the McDonald's, and I'm not making any judgements. I eat here frequently, since it's just off the freeway near my house, and McD's in general has improved their food over the past few years."	3 stars
26730	"This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me. I waited for 10 minutes in the car and he never brought it.  I decided to walk in the restaurant, they had the bag just laying there.

Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me??  Bad service!"	1 star
26731	"It's McDonald's. Their menu is growing, and has a number of new additions that look to be a bit healthier, but I come for the comfort of a Big Mac or Whopper.  This location is situated in an area that limits parking, and the drive through fills up the the point where it causes issues on the street. There's minimal seating (although I've always found a table). It is clean, and the staff the normal level of friendly and helpful."	3 stars
26732	"My whole order was a lost, the oatmeal was not closed correctly and so all the order got wet and the oatmeal did not cook right .Then, they didn't even supply me with spoons. I asked for cream and sugar in my coffee, and they gave it to me black and  they got upset because asked them please add what I had asked for, in my coffee.
I ordered two breakfast burritos and they were cold, it's frustrating how bad some employees are trained they don't have any pride on what they do, nor care about service they provide is just a shame."	1 star

26734	"We ordered our food (It was free egg mcmuffin day) and before we even sat down they brought it to us, clearly it was made before we ordered. It was cold in the middle. They proceeded to stare, whisper, and laugh at us. I was uncomfortable eating the food, afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing."	1 star
26735	Soda was just fizzy water. Burger was undercooked. Fries were good and hot.	3 stars
26736	"Although it took longer than I expected to dine on, there was actually service and concern from the attentive  staff. And I really like the burgers. I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the  bottom bun.  To cut carbs. If you do it quickly the cheese doesn't melt so it very easy to go openfaced!"	5 stars
26737	What more can you say about McDonald's. It's what it is and their prices just keep getting higher. Fast food used to also be remotely inexpensive. Now they think they are fine dining with their prices going up quarterly.	3 stars
26738	Lazy people very rude when they fall behind which is alot they dont use the register and wont help with kiosk they need new staff	1 star
26739	I'm giving this McDonald's location a 3 star rating. This was due to the fact that their fries weren't all that great and meat was a bit oily in the quarter pound burger. I've also noticed that the quality of their buns aren't what they used to be. Not sure if I'm the only one who's noticed the change.	3 stars
26740	"It took several minutes for someone to take our order, then our order took forever and was wrong. My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese. they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch. This facility is dirty, packed both inside and in the drive thru, and is obviously understaffed."	1 star
26741	"They got my order wrong... This happens often.

To make things worse they are very inefficient. Ordered a small fries, they served 10 other people before I got mine. Seriously, fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers. I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run. Horrible!

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese."	1 star
26742	"The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours."	2 stars

26746	"The staff who took our order doesn't have customer service. Very impatient. In fairness he is so quick taking our order and he knows his menu.
Sad that frappe machine doesn't work.
No choice as thia is the only place that's open for breakfast here at universal."	1 star
26747	"I ordered a Mcdouble, which was on their outside drive thru menu. When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble, I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble, no bacon. So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect."	1 star
26748	"Drive thru order was botched. We paid for two milks and upon arriving home, discovered that there were no milks and instead of the healthier grilled chicken that my wife ordered, she was unable to eat the crispy chicken that we received due to dietary reasons...what a waste. Hopefully somebody got the milks we bought-

Avoid the drive thru at all costs! This was not the first time; and we should have stopped and checked the order-

26752	Had a terrible experience from start to finish.. An order taker in the drive thru even though there was not a back up- he interrupted my ordering- got it wrong(i corrected him)- the cashier had it wrong(i corrected him)- then they handed me the wrong order- then the fish sandwich was burnt and tasted old and the chicken nuggets tasted like very bad chicken.. Worst McDonald's experience ever.	1 star
26753	I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home. Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times.	1 star
26754	As far as a McDonald's chain restaurant would go I can say that this is a decent location it's really a McDonald's so I don't know how much you could realistically expect out of a place like this you know a fast food chain but the food here is on par with any other McDonald's is there The drive-thru is relatively quick which is good	3 stars

26756	"As far as McDonalds go, this is a pretty good one. Know how I can tell? Fries are *always* blistering hot.  I live near this McDonald's and I don't have to force myself to come here even though I pick up food 2 or 3 times per month. Stuff that's supposed to be hot is hot; stuff that is supposed to be cold is cold. As far as the service goes, here's the amazing thing: mostly millennials are working here .... and the service is still good! If you are in the area and hungry, I recommend this McDonald's....but please don't tease the Millinials they get spooked easy and stampede.  Thanks."	4 stars
26757	It's a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it's a good facility they don't run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald's do so that's why I didn't give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they're good	4 stars
26758	"My brother and I tolerate it because it's close to us and it's open when no one else is.  But. .. you get the loonies showing up there.

If you're looking for friendly service, don't bother but it's mcdonald's, who come for the service. They drive thru is fine but gets way backed up"	3 stars
26773	This isnt IN n OUT and people do actually want to look at the menu... so having your employees stand outside in the hot sun... around the corner from the full menu... taking orders with an out dated sandwich board is pretty ridiculous.

I like it so much they recognize my voice coming thru the drive thru in Sherman Oaks.

I Kid you not, this Heavy Hitter was the size of a Men's Shoe Size 12!!!
I was amazed at how tame it was...
Kinda scary the way it just lingered in the parking lot without a worry in the world.
Maybe It was Stuart Little and was waiting for his food in the drive thru.
Unsure , either way, If you come To this McDonald's you might be blessed with his Presence..
Enjoy your McMuffin!!   "	1 star

1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.

She then re-opened it after seeing we were missing additional sauce from our order.. she was very rude cutting me off and stated you need to ask for extra sauce when ordering, since it                           s now a charge for sauce?

27376	It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money. Also the manager  just looks at you and not take your order	1 star
27377	"Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service. Never in my years of walking this planet have I ever experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location. Charging me almost $30 for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake. I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt, the cashier seemed new, but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly. Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix, but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty."	1 star

27380	"McDonald                           s in Roanoke has been a disappointment to me lately. It seemed like a good idea to use them as a fast stop for breakfast on my way to work this past week. Unfortunately I was let down by the service I received.                                     
The first day I ordered In the drive through and the lady taking my order seemed like should could not understand me so when I got to the first window and paid, I asked for a receipt the lady                           s response was                            We don                           t have receipts                            When I got to the second window and received my food it was comandwich than what I had ordered.                                     
I decided to try them again one last time the third morning in a row and the service in the drive through was rather rude just like the first time, and I received the wrong size coffee AGAIN.                                     When I asked the man about it his response was                            I don                         "	1 star

Came back told the girl I'm missing drink. She told me to go back around and re-order.  I go back in line and get my drinks.  I get home, my whole order is wrong.

27384	"I have been in line for 10 minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms. I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off. I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident . She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald's Sylvia said I did. I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it's a two-lane and I said no ma'am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it's only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting. You're going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don't get two lanes drawn up. Number two, Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us. I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same.I'm very disappointed how McDonald's has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident. I thought the motto is safety first."	1 star

Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!"	2 stars

I collected , drove 10 + minutes towards home before the kid figured out that his order had every single add on we had requested not be added. I called and , zero apology,  was told to drive back to the drive thru and collect. OH-KAY. Lovely customer service already. I get there and the 'manager' asks me to return the wrong order, I handed it back (untouched) and he made  huge scene of firing it in the trash. emmmm, your mistake. No apology and ALL the attitude ?

I even ate pizza here and the management didn't seem to care and it's a good place to eat and work. There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat."	5 stars

It doesn't look like you're that close, but I promise, just take a wide turn in the drive-thru"	3 stars

The Quarter Pounders are made with fresh meat now and you can really taste the difference. And everyone knows that McDonald's has the best Fountain Coke. They tested a couple of times per hour just to ensure the formula is Right. Plus, they have those nice fat straws that make for big sips. :-)"	5 stars

I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway. I was nothing but polite. Petty does not look good on you McDonalds."	1 star
27417	Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.	1 star
27418	"I went through the drive-thru and ordered 3 cheese burgers. I waited in line for like 10 minutes. I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasn't ready. It wasn't even busy, so I didn't understand why it took so long to make 3 cheeseburgers. After waiting in my car for 10 more minutes, I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted 20 minutes waiting for food. As soon as I ask for a refund, one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me. I guess they forgot I was waiting on it? I will never come back to this location."	1 star

I was there for over an hour and a half letting my kids eat and play and not once did I see anyone clean a table or anything off the floor. It would also be helpful for there to be napkins in the play area so you could clean up messes without leaving your kids or taking the whole crew with you."	3 stars

27428	"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50                    2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window. It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers."	1 star

Everything was right, but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex, which is really just for boys, and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter.

27436	"This restaurant had an nice increase in customer service once new management took over (at least I think it was new MGMT), and a remodel. Now, however, they seem to be sliding back into giving constant wrong orders, not giving there sauces that they make you ask for (don't forget to ask for ketchup at the window, since they don't seem to want to take that part at the speaker).  We are back into driving to the Southlake location to give them it money since they rarely get our order wrong.  Thankfully, we don't eat McDonald's that often anymore, otherwise this review would be lower"	3 stars
27437	"Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken. Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading. Fries were soggy and unappealing. Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy, with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food. Stay clear of this place. Staff definitely doesn't care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment."	1 star

27440	"This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks."	2 stars
27441	"Honestly, I hate to do this, but the moment I walked in, it smelled like a porta potty... and I was like ""let me just order"" I ordered 2 hot and spicy's NO LETTUCE, a large drink and a large fry. The Coke was ok, the fries like always (not full but fresh) and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without. I told the kid in the front ""this sandwich has lettuce one it"" which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it... they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said ""well it only says one sandwich no lettuce...""

I mean come on guys. The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him, just fix the dang sand which! Don't sit there and argue. So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it! At that point I asked for a refund.. little did they know, I speak Spanish. So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh... so sorry I am an inconvenience to you, but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn't have been an issue. Jesus, the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered. He gets a 5 star. But my experience was just horrible."	1 star

Not a little wrong like very wrong! Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam. But she trys to give me a Frappuccino. Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry. This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive-thru window.

The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness.  This is one of our favorite locations to visit.	5 stars
27454	Classic fast food with addictive french fries. Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US. Consistency and quality are worth each visit.	4 stars
27455	Very disappointed with this McDonald's! I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe they're cooking a fresh chicken so I didn't mind the wait. Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY! and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt!	1 star
27456	"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all"	1 star

27462	"This McDonald's screws up 96% of the time! Tonight was the last straw. My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

It was already a pain to get in the first place and now we have to do it again? My husband refused and said we'll just wait right there at the window. Need to come up with a better system than that!

Ready to eat, I took a bite, thought nothing of it, I then took another bite and look to see that I bit into a VERY PINK QUARTER POUNDER!!!!! So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again!

I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries. Lately there's been lots of issues with this McDonalds, people have attitudes, don't have manners, they don't even say hi  or thank you for coming. I'll be taking my service elsewhere.

27653	It's my local McDonald's so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane. But what's the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight. Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control. Food wise things take a long time usually but it's your normal McDonald's type food except they don't salt their fries well.	2 stars

27657	"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal. It seems this McDonald's is doing everything to lose business. They thrive off of convenient location alone. Absolutely terrible experience."	2 stars

I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville.

27731	"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food. We would not return to this location."	2 stars

When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.

Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering... If give her 5 stars                           ""we don't do refills here."" What?

The inside is clean (as well as the bathrooms) and has a lot of seating.  There's also an indoor play area for the kiddos.  In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers."	4 stars
27763	Not satisfied with purchase. Female manager messed up my order twice. My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger. I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes.	1 star

27787	This McDonald's is way more efficient than the other McDonald's down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom. But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to. I didn't get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though.	3 stars

Which took me almost half an hour just to get to the window in my car. That's nuts. The order has already been placed and all I'm doing is just picking it up. You guys gotta find a better system or else close this place down if you can't get it together.	3 stars

You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in they're going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry. There's no reason to give these service workers a hard time they're doing what they can. Thanks guys. Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it's always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce. Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes.	4 stars

Sauce  sweet sour souce  ,and my large order  fries with only half full.  The last thing is herzelnut iced coffee  with none flavor that I have to dumped away after first dip.  The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.  She seems the manager, no other staff dared to point this out. They all just keep silent and clean the mess. If you are not in the mood ,go home plz. When comes to customer service, be nice then . That is the priority of your duty and responsibility."	1 star
27796	The lady at the drive-thru window was so rude and angry (for no reason) that I cancelled my order and drove away. The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite.

Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be.

When I arrived and have waited in the line the man taking the orders in the drive through said our Uber order would be ready at the second window.

I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager.

Always a problem in this branch! Either order is wrong, or missing key ingredients in burgers (like ketchup for example), or stale meat ingredients, or the high prices, or the 45 -60 minutes long lines, etc.. What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald's manager, I was told there's nothing they can do about it. Very bad area to be in for sure. Ghetto employees and ghetto customers. Better to drive couple more miles either way on 192 than to come here!"	1 star

27871	"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w/ combo purchase and when I went to check out it said ""Deal is unavailable"" & wiped out the order forcing me to re-enter everything and the deal code was now invalid. I get that they are for ""participating locations"", but if you're not a participating location, put up a sign or something so I don't waste my time.
The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously? Unlike every other McDonald's? You're gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill? Again, if that is this location's policy, fine. But post a sign so that the expectation is set"	2 stars

27873	"One of my favorite features of McDonald's for me is that I know what I can expect; offerings, flavors, etc.
This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still, regardless of attitude and bad manners."	2 stars

27876	"This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

27877	"Just went to this location. Worst service I ever had! I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk. After I couldn't make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk. I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read??? Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they can't make the order at the kiosk??"	1 star

1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.

A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food.

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location

I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.	1 star

We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left."	1 star

The manager, Judith, stated that if I don't come before 4am them I'd have to wait until the next day to receive my order. Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based, I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine. I understand that my items were not available after that time, but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation. The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are ""too busy""."	1 star
27956	"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while."	1 star

The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up.

When it did arrive, the chicken and burger were cold. Duly sent back, to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick, but no apology."	1 star
27960	Take the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location!!!! My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke 2 seconds after it was handed to me. The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct. Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order! I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who should                           ve been in the kitche	1 star
27961	"Always a favorite, McD's is still serving up all the favorites - we were there for breakfast and had a short wait. Alas, no dining room availability at this location for now. Very reasonable prices, of course, and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries!"	4 stars
27962	"I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work. I got a bacon, egg and cheese mcgriddle, the hash brown and a caramel frappe. I ended up with food poisoning    "	2 stars
27963	Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes. I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed. Again usually this restaurant is a five-star McDonald's just not on this day.	4 stars
27964	"First time I had been to a McDonald's in America. It's certainly nothing special, but there isn't anything wrong with the location.

Food was fine and it was cool to try the different items from the menu. Also, yes, french fries taste the same whether you buy them from the UK or America."	5 stars
27965	"I will admit this was a first at this location as it is always so busy when I arrived there was a line almost out to the street and this is a double drive through was worried I would be there a while but only took about ten mins as they moved quick and to my surprise my fries were fresh and hot. Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky. But all was right on this last time. Good cheez burg&   "	5 stars
27966	"Ridiculous.. i am not one to ridicule, this is pure ridiculousness... I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can't even get a kids meal right... you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples... I received  double fries,  no nuggets, as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets. I tried calling when I arrived back. No one answered the phone!!! Here is your negative review that could've been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues"	1 star
27967	"Slowest McDonald's I have ever been to in my life. Took an hour just to order in drive thru... Then took another 20 minutes just to get our food (orders 2 burgers, apple pie, and 20pc nugget so shouldn't have taken to long at all"	1 star
27968	"Busy, under staffed, slow service, condiment stand a mess, out of lids, ketchup dispenser broken.  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag!  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table????  Very,  very ill-run and poorly  managed location.  Just  awful."	1 star
27969	I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food. Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still haven't gotten my food. I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand. They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand. This McDonalds sucks	2 stars
27970	"I love this place, I've been to this place for year's and not even one time a worker has been rude to me."	5 stars
27971	Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers	1 star
27972	"McDonald's is ok. I just wish they wouldn't pester people in leaving while the kids are playing in the play place. I mean I get the no loitering, but we bought food, and kids are just trying to play and they didn't really finish their own good. They just wanted to enjoy the empty play area"	3 stars
27973	"I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds, how do you screw up a cheeseburger? I asked for no ketchup, no mustard, no pickles, no onion. I got no condiments and NO MEAT! I mean really, learn to read and pay attention. This is my 3rd time this has happened."	1 star
27974	"Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed"	1 star
27975	Double check your orders. I got someone else order and when i took it back. The employee placed it back to give it to someone else. I told her I touched the burger to throw it away. She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away. Horrible attitude from the cashier. Order was not completed.	1 star
27976	Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.	2 stars
27977	"Long line at kisok, which was only way to order due to lack of staff. Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk. Tea was weak, had been sitting awhile. Terrible experience"	1 star
27978	"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all."	1 star
27979	Only go here because it's open late. Food not always the same presentation or great tasting..but it is McDonald's. What do you expect.... You know when you go there what you're getting. Cheap food..poor customer service.. And maybe your order correct.	2 stars

Food was sat on the counter in a bag whilst staff were stood around not doing a lot. Food was cold. Every table was waiting for their food and the queue to collect was almost at the door. Order was incomplete and had to queue up again to collect t"	1 star
27983	"they took forever and it was hardly busy, i asked if my order was ready after waiting for like 20 minutes and was told no, just to be handed my order less than a minute after, it was sitting there the whole time, and the female working the register was disrespectful for no reason."	1 star
27984	I visited this location during the morning rush. The store was clean and the staff was very punctual. My son and I received our food within 1 minute after ordering. This location looks as if it was recently updated and it includes a playland for the little ones. Based off of today's experience I would recommend this location to anyone visiting.	5 stars
27985	"This location is frequently busy and if the general manager isn't on site, the dining room and play area become dirty quickly.  Service is notoriously slow, and since they cater to primarily a transient crowd, there really isn't a need to improve."	3 stars
27986	"Just stopped by my local McDonald's to pick up some breakfast items before going to work. The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts."	4 stars
27987	"The food is always on the meh side. Luke warm, never hot and fresh even when it's busy and the employees are typically miserable."	4 stars
27988	New interior looks great. This location has the new digital ordering computers. The food came quickly and the staff were helpful. Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasn't marked	4 stars
27989	"All I had was a hot fudge sundae, which was good. The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda. They legally should not have been open. They were still running things as usual though."	2 stars
27990	"Showed up 20 minutes before the menu change and was told I couldn't order what I wanted off of the advertised menu. When I question that to the employee they basically said they were too underpaid and lazy to make me chicken nuggets and all I could have was the two mcChicken sandwiches they had left... Or nothing.

Great customer service... NOT"	1 star
27991	"If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would. Absolutely zero customer service. The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed, neither of them spoke a word in person. The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn't be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at. I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy, but they weren't at all. Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction."	1 star
27992	"Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults. The food is your typical McDonald's fare with nothing special to write about. They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays."	4 stars
27993	"As usual the food prep people don't know how to read a order slip. Big mac no sauce no cheese.
What did I get? Big Mac cheese ONLY on it.
Ya'll did make it thru first grade so you could read simple 3-5 letter words? Right?
Just asking."	1 star
27994	The manager Judith is extremely rude. She gave us cold meals we said excuse me she looked at us and walked away. 6 minutes later she came back to me after leaving me standing there just stared at me and I told her                            I                           m sorry my food is cold                            she turned around grabbed me a new wrap handed it to me and walked away. Never saying a word. We had a second order and still had to wait. It is 	1 star
27995	"This McDonald's was excellent,  the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee, it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald's I have been to.

It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant,  no matter where I go in America,  so far, there is a better than 90% chance that the coffee, for example,  will be the same thing I am use to and desire."	5 stars

It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.  They used to make great cappuccinos, but it got to be too loud, and those machines broke more frequently than lattes'."	5 stars
28001	There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again! Open up the lobby people	2 stars
28002	Slow. Food often old.	3 stars
28003	This is one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever seen. Very modern inside. Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food. At least it was very fresh!	4 stars

Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had..."	1 star
28005	This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's	2 stars
28006	Good for a quick bite on the go with a busy day right across the street from Old Town this place is got an indoor playground which is nice. The kids enjoyed it the one time we came in and stopped and let them play. Unfortunately the last time we came through the drive-thru and there was a vagrant near the one entrance so that was a little unsettling other than that has McDonald's go it was okay	3 stars

Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong. What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees.  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think , they would emphasize excellent customer service. McDonalds you are slipping."	1 star
28018	This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.	1 star
28019	What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.	1 star

28023	Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a Mcd's. The place was busy and lacked the people/system to handle it. Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate orders. It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order - one chicken wrap with sweet tea.	3 stars

28027	"The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations; making orders fast and reliable.

28030	"Spent 15 minutes in the drive-thru,  most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food. Didn't get a straw, my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my son's happy meal had no toy. All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn't get either one right even after a 15 minute wait. Completely unacceptable."	1 star

28034	Nice place to eat anytime you want. They are very busy. People come by the bus loads to eat hamburgers all over. It's a tourist trap. Cheap and hot food. Your money goes far. Most people go there for a quick meal and internet which is free.	5 stars
28035	"3 stars for being a clean and friendly McDonald's but it'll never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go there's a 90% chance they are out or the machine is down. Morning? Down. Afternoon? Down? Nighttime? Down. Halloween? Down. On Halloween?! Yes, completely down all night. I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of it."	3 stars

EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food."	1 star

Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag. I do not recommend the drive through.	2 stars
28049	Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area.

Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal."	1 star

Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything.... The strips needed more cook time ""my opinion"" so I brought them inside and made the request.... Now it's McDonald's... you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it, told the M.O.D. and he says he can take care of it, he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited. Now when I did receive it, he made sure he gave it to me, and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip! 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn't like."	4 stars

Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street."	2 stars

28091	"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

Getting better and better, the manager Monique she runs a tight ship. Every time I'm in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing. A great thank you for your great service Monique!

Wow place was packed! Was able to wait just a short time and got my order. Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff! Must of been 30+ people in line only 5 min wait. Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks, both with smile's on."	4 stars
28092	I used to love this location. It is the close one to my home. But lately the service has gone down hill. Mostly through the drive thru where I usually get most of my orders! New management or what? Please quit thanking me so much and get my order right. Oh and when I say two cremes and 4 splendas in my coffee get it right. This morning the sticker they put on the coffee said 3 cremes and 4 sugars. I am diabetic. I tested it and it was not right so I waited to get to work and put one more splenda thinking they had not put the right amount. Drank about half when I noticed the sticker. That coffee affected my health because of the sugar! Their is kore but why bore you. Hope they change.	3 stars

28101	I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.	1 star

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean."	2 stars

She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???

This McDonald's need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant. When I come to this McDonald's I always spend $40 or better. Get y'all stuff together"	1 star
28682	"This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take customers' orders.  This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter, wishing to place their orders.  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders.  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months, resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant.  Hire more staff!!!"	3 stars

28685	I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.	1 star

I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, the 10 piece nuggets, the fish sandwich and a large iced tea.  Overall the meal is good.  I wish Mcdonald's had more grilled chicken options.  But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good"	5 stars

Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered. Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container. I'm so sick of these restaurants.

28724	"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive."	1 star
28725	Cold fries. Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  The m&ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out.  $18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter. Then subpar at best.	2 stars

They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.	5 stars

28739	I felt really sick after eating the fish fillet sandwich. They made me wait a long time at curbside for my sandwich and fries. I assumed it will all be fresh. How wrong was I. Disgusting sandwich and stale fries. Never returning to this location again.	1 star
28740	"I ordered a kid's meal that took 14 minutes to receive,  they claim hash browns are not a lunch time item even though it's on the all day breakfast menu claiming it took 12 minutes to cook a hash brown worst location ever"	1 star
28741	"I came here at around 11pm last night, I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal, 2 cheeseburgers, and I asked for the fries fresh. I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds."	1 star
28742	The worst place to eat. Go there only if you have 3 hours of leisure time & you dont mind waiting 45 minutes to an hr to be taken care of. Only one manager & too many rookies are uncapable too supply the high demand.	1 star

28745	"Worst McDonald's in the area. After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window, for them to inform me that they were closed. Mind you this was at 1:12 am Saturday morning. The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 a.m not 1:12 a.m!! Clearly management didn't want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing. Will never go back to this location."	1 star
28746	"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer.

Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff."	1 star

McDonald's seems to be the only place that has managed to keep it all together and do things right! Employees at this location are always efficient, professional and pleasant."	5 stars
28749	"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again."	1 star
28750	"Went through the drive through, nothing to complain about. But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there. Too many fast food places in this area are like that though. Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they'd be happier. Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too? Yeah I think so!"	4 stars

28752	Horrible McDonald's I had visited this McDonald's in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor. How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign? or just tell me politely to watch my step. I would've kept coming to this McDonald's but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired.	1 star
28753	Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window. It's awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag.	2 stars

28755	"Ok, so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets, I personally prefer the Wendy's spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting. The McDonald's Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone, add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat!!! But mine were extremely dry and hard, one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting, I can say I tried them but I was not impressed."	2 stars

She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this   "	2 stars

Mistakes happen.	3 stars
28765	Always get my food fresh and never mind waiting. This location is so convenient! It is always clean and well maintained inside and out. I only gave 4 stars because the staff is hit or miss. Most of the time there is a very nice crew when I go. Sometimes there   	4 stars

I shouldnt have to argue to get hot food I paid for. Im back to update my review I originally gave my visit a 1 star.

Thank Mrs. Williams for reaching out .	5 stars

She said out loud, in front of customers ""ends at 1030, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT"" No everyone DOESNT know that, some serve it 24/7. She continued to berate me."	1 star
28769	For fast food this McDonald's is better then average. I think it is probably due to the staff. There is a young girl named Carissa on the Am shift who is excellent. She sees us come in the door and has started our coffee ( we always stop on the way to work). She runs around the restaurant ' topping' off your coffee . We always know when she is working the restaurant is neat and clean. Thanks Carissa for starting our day off with a smile	4 stars
28770	"The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare. We have coupons with the McDonald's app. The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them, because she was tired of having to ring then up. My wife and I went to the restaurant today and, she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all. I'm going to try and avoid this McDonald's in the near future."	2 stars

28802	"Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida. If I could give 0 stars that would be more suitable.  They mess up orders they're the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar. They dont understand what ""light ice"" means and you're going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons. Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money, any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for. Take it from a local, stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money. I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to. This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida. Please do yourself a favor and go to any other McDonalds to get the experience you deserve."	1 star
28803	Cashier Jamesha mocking customers laughing in their face. Moving very slow. At her own beat. Very rude. If I were apart of the Wright family she would definitely not be apart of my family business. I was in drive thru for 25 minutes before parking and coming inside all to witness the foolery which has the line backed up in the first place. However Jamesha is the only one who had a name tag on. Everyone looked over worked and under paid. Very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also as I'm writing this review waiting my order it's been 35 minutes here total. The manager sets the tone and she is even slower. Her walk expresses she's lazy	1 star
28804	"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness."	2 stars
28805	"This location was awful today. They rang up our order wrong, then gave it to us still wrong. Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting.

But not getting right items with orders, or taking longer the should be to get final order is saying something.

It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives.

Waited a minute, but when the items didn't appear on the screen, I said ""Ma'am?"" and her response was ""YEA?!"" in a condescending, scathing tone. I said never mind and got out of there. Heifer needs a reality check."	1 star

I bit into the rotten lettuce and that                           s how discovered it. I had to talk to the manager and he though making me a new one was fair.

29815	"Disappointing. McDonald                           s is my standby for fast food. Normally I get consistent food with decent, sometimes amazing service. I know it                           s not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review"	1 star
29816	For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald's it's the biggest and the best. If you're looking for customer service not a chance.  You're better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order. I'll recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children.	5 stars
29817	"This McDonald's was awesome, I've never been to a McDonald's where the service was so good and the food options were amazing                                           "	5 stars

29820	The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.	5 stars
29821	I put in an order for in-store pickup but didn't realize that the dining room closed at 12. The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly. Great customer service!	5 stars
29822	"Visited the 'world's biggest McDonald's on international drive. Pizza and burger ordered were great, however, had to wait over an hour for food as it was so busy. Pizza also came first, (table delivery) and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly. Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes. Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked. Overall good was fine, but service poor due to being so busy!"	3 stars

29824	We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here. The food and service times are not the same as it used to be.	1 star
29825	"They would do a lot better if they didn't park every car in the drive thru. I know they do this just to make their drive thru time look better to the higher-ups, but it absolutely ridiculous . Simply process your orders faster and give customers their order. Every time I've been parked, I've ended up waiting 5-10 minutes! When I'm only ordering 1 or 2 combos, it makes it a little asinine."	3 stars
29826	Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open	1 star
29827	Ordered thru the app which was a quick and easy process. Mcflurry and shakes were broken and unavailable at the time of visit. Parked in curbside pickup as drive through line was long. Quickly and accurately received my order.	4 stars
29828	I visited this location 5/5 at 5:07 pm. The 2 young ladies (black and Hispanic) that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires. When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go. First and last time visiting this location. Smh customer service training needed asap	1 star
29829	"didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago, i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald's app code to get the points, i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald's app code to another car order( my card is linked to the app ) and I ended up paying for their food, i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said, yeah I think that car  is using my code , the guy just said "" is your lucky day go to the next window ""  It was late at night so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice. Tried calling but they didn't solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review"	2 stars
29830	"The manager was rude, I waited for more than 40 minutes, understanding that they were busy.  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed.

29832	"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one."	1 star

29835	"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs"	1 star
29836	Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.	1 star
29837	"Went through the drive-thru and had a pre-order. They rushed us through, they were busy, then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong. Not even worth going back for. It's happened multiple times at this location."	2 stars
29838	"It was a clean and convenient location, but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered.  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard, no pickles, no onions.  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder.  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car, she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food.  She made no effort to offer the food.  She made us get it where she was.  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there."	2 stars
29839	Always friendly staff. Fairly clean and food to order. Shout out to all workers and managers!	5 stars
29840	They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.	2 stars
29841	Rude staff.  Slow food delivery.  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted.  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up.   Food quality is poor.	1 star
29842	"Atmosphere is cool and unique. Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks. The wait time was forever, service was definitely slow. But it was also Easter and spring break weekend. But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating."	2 stars

29845	"5-30-19 - On the way back from all day at Universal Island of Adventures, so decided on a cheaper meal to end the night. Had dinner with family here. Busy night, but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of counter, and pay. Cool, since in Georgia they haven't caught on at many yet. Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon, pickles, and cheese, and a large fry. Service was great for me. They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and bathrooms. Enjoyed the experience. Went back for dessert, but paid at the counter, and let them know we appreciated the service."	3 stars

29849	Being in the area this is a must see place. Had a great meal overall. It was busy but got almost all our food very quick but the pizza. Quite understandable that the pizza would take longer but the only thing is that by the time it arrived my fries were almost cold. No big deal but they should keep that in mind. Other than that the pizza was great and service was good. I                           ve worked McDonald        	5 stars
29850	"Very busy drive thru. Cars were lined up literally around the building from pick up windows all the way to the front on the restaurant facing International Drive. Informed at the window that they were out of food items we ordered, and asked if we can order something else.

However, even though we had a big order everything was in the bag. The food were also hot and fresh."	3 stars
29851	The kids wanted it ...the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries....it's McDonald's...the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive  but you can't complain well it's like say your order and here's your meal...lol but it's McDonald's	2 stars
29852	"Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait. I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door."	2 stars
29853	Went through the drive-thru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged  for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me.

The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund.."	2 stars
29855	"Arrived at the McDonald's at 10:20PM, and the posted hours said the location was open until 12:00AM. An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn't let us in until we mobile ordered, although another employee seemed confused by this. Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed (again, even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM). Additionally, while this happened, there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating, and there were empty tables."	1 star

Father                           s Day, drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 mins. This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe.              "	2 stars
29857	We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team. What an experience. There's a lot of different food options including PIZZA! The place is amazing. If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place. Unbelievable.	5 stars
29858	"Great Mcdonalds! Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs."	5 stars

The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name. The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window.

After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me ""one at a time, I can't skip your order in front of other people"".  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.

You know,  at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job.  I was scared to ask her for a cup holder, but I did any way,  lol.

Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up."	5 stars

29959	@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.	1 star
29960	Waited 25 mins. Wasn't busy. Half food was cold. The deluxe quarter pounder only had lettuce and mayo added. No sauces for 26 chicken nuggets. Guy who brought the food really didn't wanna talk or answer the question because he all but ran to the back. Again drive thru wasn't busy and instead had maybe 3 families and 3 singles. And the single people had their food already.	3 stars

Not only did I have to wait an extended period (three to five minutes) at the order board but we had a large order. When I got up to window number one the girl working the window was rude, did not want to allow me to review my large order with her, spoke extremely fast and unprofessional then rushed me to the next window without even paying.

It's not even a short staff problem, its a I don't care problem.

A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast.

I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.

30046	It's fast food so its hit or miss. Often the fry grease tastes old. The Tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to syrup. Half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully cooked. Other times its great?	3 stars

When they finally came to give us food the employee gave us the wrong food and had the BIGGEST attitude when I said the order was wrong. DONT COME HERE IF YOU WANT FAST FOOD ITS MORE LIKE SLOW FOOD. Don                           t recommend horrible will not return again.

30062	"We waited for 50 minutes in the drive through. The line moved at the beginning, but then stopped completely near the order box. Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldn't escape. We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait. It was very frustrating.

30069	They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift.

30077	Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.	1 star
30078	Service at this place is a joke. Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food. The tea is bad 60 percent of the time. I believe this falls directly on management. As there are always new employees there. Most times having poor attitudes. Also I have never once been suggested a pie. I don't even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer. And probably be un edible. I only stop in there maybe once a month when I'm in a bind.	1 star
30079	I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center. I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonald's and grab some food. Boy was that a mistake. I arrived at this McDonald's at 11:45. I did not order my food at the drive-thru window until 10 minutes after 12:00. By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 12:30. This has to be the absolute slowest McDonald's in the history of any restaurant in the world. It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane. They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one. Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building. But they were slower than molasses. I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one.	3 stars

30081	"I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone. Maybe they're better during the day, but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you're looking to get in and out."	1 star

30091	I would give 3.5 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos. The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside. It's been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald's has definitely gone downhill. Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money.	2 stars
30092	"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever."	1 star

Overall a truly terrible 'fast' food location."	1 star

Service treats you like you are a problem for them, ie: the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off, the customer said what about my drink.  The server rolled her eyes walked away, brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away.  No I am sorry, no have a nice day.  For me it took over 7 minutes to just get a milkshake.  Never Again for me."	1 star
30107	Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car.

30119	"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed."	1 star

We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order. It also seems to give you a little more time to order. The place was very clean and modern in design. We didn't interact too much with staff but the little we did, they seemed very nice and helpful. Although not used this time by us, I did notice a cart specifically for sauces, seasonings, etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked.. the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues.

From what I could see, the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a wreck.

Back to the self help machines, it states that they will bring you the drink to your table. They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front. I don't really care but someone should change what the machine states.

Overall, this is a modern looking McDonald's. Most of the days I went here it has been good. But I guess their weekend was a different story."	3 stars

30136	Well just because that McDonald's is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesn't give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I won't bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because you're on international drive don't mean you can rip people off and that's all you're doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices	3 stars
30137	"There's only 1 way to describe my experience. Have you ever gone in to a daycare, and shook a basket full of babies, well I haven't but I could imagine what it sounds like, and that's how it sounded when I walked in the doors, I didn't order anything, and the employees were on there phones anyways.

30140	I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet-O-Fish fish or they're not offering the 2 for 5  but that's okay they're not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread  the Fish so I guess they had to cut  cost somewhere when they charge you $15 for fish and don't put anything  on it. I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly	1 star
30141	"Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids.  No line ordered at kiosk right away.  15 workers and no one working.  Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working. 17 minutes to get 4 egg McMuffins at 8 am
Worst service ever"	1 star
30142	If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it. This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get. What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 30-40 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal?	3 stars
30143	"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me."	1 star
30144	No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long. Would recommend over McDonald's entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher.	4 stars
30145	"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend."	2 stars

Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant."	4 stars
30149	"Sorely disappointed. Outlets in every wall and not a single one working. The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked. The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked, so kudos to him. Place was clean enough I guess."	2 stars

30153	"This McDonald's is across the street from the Orange County Convention Center. The girl at the counter looked at us when we got there, and made no attempt to greet us or even approach the counter until we asked her if she was Ok. The food was fine, but the service definitely needs improvement."	3 stars
30154	"I never thought I would rate a McDonald's as 5 stars but I did. Food was typical of a McDonald's but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant. They smiled, checked up on us, cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations."	5 stars
30155	"On Saturday, at 11:25am, drive through is moving at 4 to 5 minutes per car, which works out to about 30 to 35 minutes to get your food from when order was placed. Also, only use lane 1 and you will go faster."	2 stars
30156	"The worst McDonald's in the area. I have lived close to this McDonald's for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience. My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable. Also the team members and management just don't seem  to care. I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold. I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave ... I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items. With that said I will not be back to this McDonald's location ever."	1 star
30157	"Great food. Not speaking English at the drive-through window is a big downfall for me.  Not sure why they would put somebody like that taking orders. I repeated myself three different times and then they finally brought somebody else to the window. Very frustrating

30158	"The management staff were bullying a new employee by telling her have needed to clean the dirty trays , the manger did this while the girl was taking my order, very uncool. The rest of the staff in the drive through laughed at the the poor girl and I was embarrassed for her. I mean I know it's just a starting job for some people, but they still need to be professional."	3 stars
30159	This place was freaking unbelievable!  It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins.  The food was good. I had the broccoli and                                      Alfredo. I do recommend it.  The large fish tank in the middle of the floor	5 stars
30160	The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met! Tasha was the sweetest worker there! The food was good and as isially good price. They had some fancy new machines that had to be 2019 machines I was lost and couldn't get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy! But overall good time okay food good people	4 stars
30161	Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.	1 star

30165	"We were not impressed with this location. They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive-through. We made it inside, but that wasn't much better. The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk."	2 stars
30166	McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service. Not sure what's hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative. Chick-fil-A this is why I love you so much.	1 star

Went there on may 7th 2021 at approximately 11pm pizza was closed ,play are arcade closed,  ordered food to eat in tables dirty, asked several times to get it cleaned, and to get better in had to stand on a line for 35 minutes to get my drink because they wouldn't bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care"	1 star
30169	"This is the worst run McDonald's I have EVER seen in my life, the service is super slow. Its complete chaos. The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff. I would rate it zero but that wasn't an option."	1 star
30170	"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement."	1 star
30171	Totally not the staff's fault but there was only 1 person to take orders from the double drive thru. There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected it.	4 stars
30172	I have no idea how the employees got hired. They are so rude and have no manners. They literally see you standing there for over 10 minutes waiting and no one offers to help.They all need to stay home if they don        	1 star

30174	Drive thru 10 minutes to get to screen to order. Then no one to take order for another 5 minutes. Can't get out of line. Trapped!  Such slow service. Sort of silly for this newly updated McDonald's to be poorly run or staffed.	1 star
30175	26min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn't have someone who can take my order. Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake. International Driveway to busy for this time of the day. They need more personal.	1 star
30176	"I wish there were warning signs on the drive in. Turn back now- unless you have 30 minutes to wait in the drive thru to order, pay and receive your food. Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you, you are stuck..... Hopefully you don't want any Coke with your meal. And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional 20 minutes on to your wait. Haven't even tasted my food yet. Do not recommend."	1 star
30177	We used the kiosks to order and pay for the food. You are supposed to take a number and sit down and they will bring you your food. We had to wait for numbers. She told me they've had those kiosks for at least 8 months. The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of orders. We had to get the food ourselves from the counter. My poor mom had to wait in the line because she couldn't make the kiosk work. She was so stressed out by the time she sat down.	3 stars

30179	"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1"	2 stars
30180	"Took forever, which I've gotten used too, being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive.

30183	Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12/01/2018 at  around 10:30pm.

Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service. Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize. Will never be back. If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service.	1 star

30206	Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order. Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line. Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in. When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call	1 star
30207	"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered 3 items. 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item - a double cheeseburger.

30209	Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.	2 stars

30211	What a horrible experience. I sat at the front counter for over 15 mins for utensils and sauce on Dec 21st at 9:45pm. The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up. Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that. This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad.	1 star
30212	"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando."	1 star
30213	The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location	2 stars
30214	What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes. The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct. We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected . When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it. When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut. The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt. He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes. Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another.       	1 star
30215	"Horrible service- stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 6.00 for my food. Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others, workers were in back play fighting.

After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away. She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food. Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds."	1 star

They also don                           t put the                             best by                             stickers on them                             I  "	1 star

30223	"Although McDonald's chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery, however this outlet is different.
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers.
Moreover, they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages. Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment."	5 stars

30226	"If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would! I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids. Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15+ to get our food. Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The sad part, I didn't have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered."	1 star
30227	"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality."	1 star
30228	"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with."	1 star
30229	"Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald's. Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 10:13 pm..waited and waited..drive through backed up, 20-30 people inside waiting, absolute chaos. Finally at 10:47pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave. Literally 35 minutes for coffee. Horrible experience, short staffed and totally out of control."	1 star
30230	"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book. Coming from a long time McDonalds customer, I wont be back again."	1 star

From the little burgers to the quarter pounder, it's the same. Doesn't even taste like meat anymore. They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months, but we'll over a year now, and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard. What happened?"	2 stars
30237	I love this McDonald's.  It's across from Hilton Orlando.  They got good deals for breakfast and during the day.  The quality is amazing.... Way beyond what I expected.

She told me we ran out of eggs and just left me there at the window without telling me they were making more. Then she came back s few minutes later and handed me my food(Big Breakfast which is supposed to come with OJ) and I asked for salt and pepper and she said it was already in the bag, which it is NOT, and then shut the window in my face. The meat wasn                           t fully cooked and the eggs still runnie. I walked in to find out she is the actual manager. I told her I was about to shut the window in my face, I was gonna ask for Ketchup. She then snarkley replied I didn                           t shut the window in your face!

She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished. Never said hello or thank you.
Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease.

30252	"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn't give it ZERO!
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald's because the counter line was too long.  Come to find out it's because the kiosks weren't taking payment?  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food.  When I asked for a refund for my friend's food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said ""it's coming.""  Uh, no!

30255	One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.	1 star

I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly. Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait. I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say. Terrible location, regardless of how busy it is, it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty, dirty tables, and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude."	1 star

30289	We ordered on the online tablet and we sat down and waited for 15 minutes and got tired of waiting so we went to the front and was told that our food was given to us ten minutes ago and it wasn't clearly.

30302	I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.	2 stars

30310	"New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful. Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink.

30320	"New kiosk-based ordering can be a little daunting at first.  But, it does seem to speed things up.  The food is what you've come to expect from McDonald's.  It didn't disappoint."	4 stars
30321	"Terrible service, I order a few things and had to wait over 20 minutes in order to receive my items. No one approached me and another guy when we were standing at the cashier for over 10 minutes. Not even the managers. I had to ask one of the employees if they actually had a cashier."	1 star
30322	Good food	5 stars
30323	"Worst McDonald's experience  ever.  Silent 25 mins in drive thru.  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately.  When finally making to window to pay, they couldn't 'find' my order.  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando,  they completely failed the meaning of fast food."	1 star
30324	"Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things.  This morning around 12:28 am 11/24/18 when asked the very standard "" may I see the food allergy menu"" or since that wasn't available, ""would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead"" the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee.  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.  Zero stars...would not recommend."	1 star
30325	Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must haven't been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns. Never will stop there again.	1 star
30326	"Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience. Lobby tables dirty. Drinking fountain super dirty. Hamburger box came oily. Unfortunately, it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonald's.

30328	"Best Mcdonalds I've ever been too. Way better then the ones in Alabama. They use a machine for ordering,  making customizing your burger easy. Pretty neat, pretty neat. If you like Mcdonald's you'll like this place."	5 stars
30329	I ordered 20pc. Nuggets received 10pc. Nuggets(BAD IN ORDERS). I ordered pasta and what I got was more sauce than actual pasta. I had to ask for my cups because they they give it to me. I recommend to not come here if you dont want to stress out. BAD SERVICE.	1 star

30333	"This place deserves no stars. My order, which was just a sandwich, was messed up three times and it still wasn't right. The staff was lazy and unhelpful. There was trash on the tables and filthy floors. Definitely no smiles served at this establishment!"	1 star
30334	Had to order on the tablet screen. Then I was told to take a number to my table and it would be brought out. They never brought it out and I had to go ask for it at the counter 10 minutes later.	4 stars
30335	"This McDonalds location is significantly updated on the interior featuring subway tile walls and designed seating.  Also has several self-order kiosks. However, one staff member was very adamant about everyone, both young and old, using the self order kiosk which easily took longer and was less efficient than than ordering at the counter.

One plus to this location is the plentiful parking lot behind the building"	3 stars
30336	Picked the wrong lane and did not get asked for my order as 3 cars passes by in the other order lane. I pulled up and the manager told me I had to pay inside. It took 30 minutes to order and get my food. Horrible.	1 star
30337	"Ok, so everytime me and my family come to this place is a disaster because we have to wait a lot on the drive thru, I mean a lot of time waiting and they usually have us the wrong order. The service is not that good either, they have a rude attitude."	1 star

30346	"This McDonalds has kiosk only ordering. It's a good idea, you order, grab a number and sit down. If you are getting a "" to go"" order, they tell out your name.  I wish there was a more modern way to know your order is ready
A pager or digital board instead of someone telling out names."	3 stars
30347	"Slow service. They even work with one hand . If we didn't asked for our food after waiting 40 mins , it was just going to be sitting in the kitchen. The place was packed and the service was slow."	1 star

30349	"Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter, a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun. Paid for my order and waited. When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bag.I asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal. First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer, but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries. I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box. I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh. Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonald's is known to deliver."	3 stars

30352	"Two days in a row while attending a convention nearby I stopped for a quick breakfast. They don't listen .... they don't care ... and they DON'T GET IT RIGHT.

I've repeated my request for something simple so many times in one day they should be paying me for the teaching experience. Product and service have sucked both days.

30359	"I want to give this place 0 stars - the self ordering system is inefficient and way more confusing than it has to be, and staff is unprepared. Not their fault. They need training but as is right now it's awful. Took us an hour and a half to get two meals. Ridiculous."	1 star

30369	Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes.  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing.  Not an example of fast food.	2 stars
30370	It has been 20+ min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food. And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them.	2 stars
30371	I stopped in this McDonald's because it was on my way home. The manager did not want to help me and kept sending me to the kiosk to place my order. Now i was looking to ask a question but she turned around and didn't even want to acknowledge that I was there and kept telling the other workers i had to go to the kiosk.  If there isn't anyone available to help answer a question there should be a phone to pick up and ask for help. She was so rude.	3 stars
30372	"Dude got my order wrong, asked for the double fish but got a single. I didn't notice until I got back to my hotel. He did seem new so"	3 stars
30373	"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place."	1 star

30375	I decided to eat here late at night (around 11:30) during a leadership conference at the Hilton Orlando hotel down the street. Quite a few people had the same idea as I did to eat late. At least 30 people had ordered and were waiting for food. Very tight space to move around during a busy time. Very unorganized and waited 30 minutes to get my food.	3 stars
30376	"Waiting for someone to take my order.. 5 minutes later told to use the screen.. no thanks.. I don't work for mcdonalds.. Im the one with the money making the purchase..

30466	I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar! McDonald's just needs to take down this $1 $2 $3 deal. It seems as if every McDonald's I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties.	1 star
30467	"I never go to McDonald's but my fianc                   was telling me about a Chips Ahoy McFlurry?? I had to try it, and honestly it was soo good...but could do with less"	3 stars

30490	"Mario - glasses, dark hair. What an irresponsible manager. Left everything to manager Stephanie whilst he disregarded customers. Food missing from orders, another customer (young teenager ) spoken to like dirt by a female member of staff.
I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately (couldn't be bothered to make any verbal response) but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant. You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy sound(young, black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect).
What ever the main manager, Stephanie is being paid isn't enough. I saw her run, rule, command the show in a way that got the job done. She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits."	1 star

30502	"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu"	1 star

31120	"Cold Fries, missing food, wrong food, and no receipt for proof of purchase. This location just opened not that long ago and lack of detail on orders given is already a huge problem. If you want good reviews then pay attention to the people ordering your food. I ran a McDonalds so I know what was not done and the leadership and crew members need work on actually doing what they are both taught and paid to do."	1 star
31121	"Since it re-opened, I go for breakfast about once a week. Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonald's anywhere in the country -- its so perfectly crispy every time. My order has always been correct. The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long."	5 stars
31122	"We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience. Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves. Probably won't come back during our zoo trips anymore.   "	1 star

On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise don't even try it, because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT!"	4 stars

31128	"The McDonald's buy the zoo... pictures say it all.   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables, trash overflowing.  Don't even go in the bathrooms... yikes!!!!  There wasn't a clean table in the whole place!

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

The workers are really rude, don                           t know how to work, take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you.

I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies, but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies (sad face). As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonald                           s app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?"	1 star

31158	"It's a McDonald's with a Zoo twist. If you are reading this review, you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu. The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside. More importantly though is how efficient this location is. Every time I've been through I've seen a drive through 10 cars deep and watched them churn through everyone's orders in a matter of minutes. If only every drive through was this efficient."	5 stars
31159	I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars after my recent two visits (Mar. 2023). This McDonald's has gone through a major overhaul. Newly remodeled inside and out including employees.

31162	Normally every experience I                           ve had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees weren                           t in the best mood. Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again.

31164	Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service.	1 star
31165	"The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work."	1 star
31166	Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds	1 star

31177	"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years."	1 star

31181	When this McDonald's first opened. OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme. The animatronics made noise and moved. The service WAS excellent. But now it looks like a tourist trap. Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had. As far as the food goes. Well it's McDonald's same as any other.	2 stars

No big deal right? Nope manager comes out and yells at me to move/pull around she didn't care... I just had to move. 1 car was behind me still ordering. Would have thought I was blocking a fire escape or something. By the time I actually got through the drive through (due to cars ahead of me) it was 11:01AM... Really smart move guys.

When I pulled forward to the food pickup window.  I informed them and requested my receipt.  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card.  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared.  I brought to their attention about the overcharge.  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone.  I have been calling the entire day.  No answer.	1 star

When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes, said they could only take cash. I said, what!!! I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word!! I said, for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea. She looked strange, and I said please let me speak to your manager. She spoke to someone, and the manager said no and wouldn't come to the window. AWFUL!!!"	2 stars

We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return."	1 star

But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew. Plz. change crew or train them better."	1 star

THEN, my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about 15 streks of ink on it nothing legible. SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn't effect her.

31262	"Be careful with young children here! We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food. We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions, but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited. We asked her to leave several times, because it was very uncomfortable. She just continued to sit and stare at my neice. We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave.
Then the women's boyfriend called her back to his table, she left us and then they walked out shortly after.
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece. She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe. When we left they were parked next to our truck as well. We will definitely not be going back there."	1 star
31263	Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed. Every table in the play place was awful. (Ours had spilled milk). The employee took one trash can out but didn                           t pick up the trays and didn                           t clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor.

31267	"***Deserves No Stars What So Ever !***

This Place Is By Far The Worst! The drive threw lady  on 12/6/17 was absolutely rude! I came  to get some breakfast around 10:45 she continusly kept asking me"" is that it?"" I asked for a minute to see the menu. Then within a ""Second"" she asked if I was done with my order!  Sausage burritos had No Sausage. Orange Juice Cups Were Only Filled Half Way. Hash browns were cold ! By far the worst service ever! Your management needs to  work on their employees attitudes !"	1 star

31270	"Well it might have been ok, if I was not rushing, but I still stayed for my items. For this to be McDonald's, they should know that it's busier during certain hours then others..there were soo many ppl in line, the average person would have turn right back around n walked out."	2 stars
31271	The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins. Even after you've ask. Then soon as you drive away.  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to.	2 stars

31273	I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new	4 stars
31274	"I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there. Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault."	4 stars
31275	The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how it            	1 star

31279	"This mc donalds is very slow and the employees are rude and always have an attitude when you ask to get your order fresh . I always count on this mc donalds not to mess up with my order but they ALWAYS do . Also they tell you to wait on the 1 or 2 waiting spot but never come out with your food . Today i ordered chicken nuggets and asked for them to be fresh , they were ok until i noticed that the chicken was BLACK inside one of the nuggets . Maybe was black inside of more of them and i didnt notice . I have picture proof as well . This mc donalds is just trash ."	1 star
31280	"Stopped in late around 1am but received good service, area  around drive thru was clean despite age of building and outdated signage for the play place but received order and the team member even placed an extra sauce I requested at the window in a separate bag instead of trying to shove 5 in my hand like most do."	5 stars
31281	"Neatest McDonald's I've ever been to (except maybe one in Roswell, NM), the jungle zoo theme is awesome. Food was good, service was great. Even gave us a free drink, very kind."	5 stars
31282	Worst experience ever. I pay for large fries and only fill it half way. I said if I want a medium I'll pay for a medium. Now fill this up or give me my money back. Service is just the worst I've seen. I really recommend people to not go there. Waste of time and will leave you with a headache	1 star
31283	"Very Disappointed, 40 minutes to get my food due to short of staff per shift leader. No manager to get my money refunded. I've waited in the drive-thru. No apology whatsoever from that shift leader.  Will call coporate office myself.  My order was all screwed up."	1 star
31284	"I buy my drinks there. The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee. The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile , even the homeless. Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on (Robert B Cullom 75215 in South dallas) and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that !!!! As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me . Since I haven't heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald's"	5 stars
31285	"This McDonald's is by the Dallas zoo.  Kids were hungry after the Christmas lights at night event at the zoo.   Went there and found it alright. Service was relative quick but the store itself was quite dirty. Play place looked like it hasn't been wiped, and most likely haven't been sanitized. Bathrooms needed fixing and also dirty.  Hope management can quickly fix since parents want to come by for it's convenient location next to the zoo"	3 stars
31286	"The drive thru took forever and it was 10p!! The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full 7 mins. Doesn't sound ridiculous until you're sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you. Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy's credit card, and started laughing about it. His co-worker was shaking her head saying ""it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long"" ...
To add insult to injury, I got my food, I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered, I left, and my food was cold and my order was wrong."	1 star

31289	"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that."	1 star
31290	"I eat at this McDonalds at least 4 times a week. Never again. The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not. Had to wait at drive-thru order 5 full minutes before giving my order. That's at the speaker, not in line. Was told (rather rudely) to wait several times. When given the order, the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared. When I got to work, I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware, no syrup or butter and not even a napkin. Calls placed to the store went unanswered. Poor service all around."	1 star
31291	Burgers are always flat. Good for on the road food. I sure do miss the dollar menus tho. And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets.. humm	2 stars
31292	Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!	1 star

I kept saying helloo hellooo helloo and did not even bother to stop talking. Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt. There was another girl next to her biting off her Acrylic Nails and was falling all over the table where the order computer were at SO DISGUSTING!

The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner. All in all, it's different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo."	4 stars

This was new and well it could be great or ruin my lunch BUT I took a chance aaand!!! Oh my goodness!!! It was sooooooooo yummy! I mean it was so yummy that I hardly touched my delicious fries! Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good! It made my day! I was happy the rest of my meetings and sessions. Normally it would be boring but hey my tummy was cheerful and so was I."	5 stars

32231	"For the first time I see such a McDonald's, made either under Madagascar, or just like the Jungle. The lion growls, the elephant trumpets periodically, the boa constrictor hisses, the children like it. But there is no self-order screen. Civilization, apparently, has not yet reached this forest with animals."	5 stars
32232	It was prettier when I had the animals recently I went and the lady who was cleaning bothered me because she was complaining about her work with hints as if I had dirty everything and be careful I always pick up my garbage and my children's even when we arrived we cleaned the table where we did not sit because it was dirty and also when I was leaving in the bathroom I found her again and again with her hints what a pity with this lady	4 stars
32233	"What bad people to give orders, I made my order and it was 25.04 dollars and 4 cents and the cashier told me you want to leave the change and I told her, I'll leave you the koras and give me the 4 dollars and she tells me that I only gave him 26 dollars when I gave him 30 dollars because they are so like that.."	1 star

32261	"Fast service Even tho lines be long at night service is quickly, I rarely heard them say they are out of any products like most do at night I have not yet tried an hot or cold coffee at night there, hopefully the machines still works since thru are on a very busy and tourist spot, very safe to go to at night."	5 stars
32262	Restaurant was clean. Ordering at a kiosk was pretty impersonal but the cashier was nice. I didn't like my breakfast choice - it looked like an english muffin with sausage. But the muffin was very soft and tasted like syrup. Yuck. My sweet tea was weak at best. However everyone else with me enjoyed their meal. Bathroom was clean too.	5 stars
32263	"I came today at this store at 9pm and the person in charge scream from a table to us.

She said in a rude way: if you order your food will not be prepared. And she closed the computer. I didnt said anything to that woman, because im not wasting my time and energy with  people as rude like that. I                           m  writing this review because this is the closer store to my house, and is really sad that a company as your have this unprofessional & rude employees and is not the first time i have a bad cx service experience in this store, but today was to far.

32268	It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working.

No signs and no one notifying the customers. The other lane was long so I parked and ordered online for curbside pick up. After waiting for a while, no one deliver my food so went inside believing maybe they were short staffed but the employees were chatting and wondering around. order.
Even more disappointing, fries were cold and soggy. What happened to the tomato, lettuce and mayo in "	1 star
32270	"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. On Friday, February 17th, it was closed at 9:41pm. Wth? Really? Couldn't believe it. Staff that turned me away wasn't very polite either. What is this? Chucky cheese or something? Although I think even they stay open longer than that, Friday night c'mon.

32276	"For workers like her big companies' name are ashamed.

What a horrific experience I just had;  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my son's smoothie and started singing a vulgar song/lyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me. All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

32323	"I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future."	1 star

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didn                           t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

32399	"Biscayne Blvd., and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive-thru window with 4 employees (one who couldn't even understand or speak English), I made a complaint to McDonald's yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner's organization.  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is, and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs.  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski, CEO of McDonald's, as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's in Chicago.  They need to understand why McDonald's is doing so poorly; afterall, when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year, maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select, train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service. I will not be going to this, or any other, McDonald's again!  It was that bad.  McDonald's corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers.  The owner clearly must put numbers before people.  Horrible, horrible experience!  Will stick with Wendy's instead.  They have much better food and service!

04/05/2021 - As a follow-up to my complaint to McDonald                           s 1-800#, and the CEO, I did receive a written response and phone call.  Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation.  I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonald                           s.  I will add that although I had been to this McDonald                       "	1 star

One of them gave me a thumbs up to go back to the drive-through which I did and it was the same result the lady did not answer and finally I decided I would leave, and right before I left she answered by saying one moment please so I waited hey moment and she still was not ready so I just left . There have been two vehicles in the drive-through before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience.

Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc.

Either they correct the app or better train the staff."	4 stars
33218	"Bad service in the disgusting place of churre, the supervisors who have to set an example, just gossip and speak ill of the clients, I don't know how the owners do not come as a surprise. There are people who really deserve the job. Hygiene shines. .hand sanitizer empty"	1 star
33219	What a real lack of respect to close the door for customer service before 10 pm between almost 15 minutes before and they told me that the boxes were turned off what a bad service from this establishment the staff are super rude if they don't want to work better don't go       	1 star
33220	"In the night shift 9 / 10 they are taken as a break because several times I have gone and they say that it is ""closed"", and the service has always been very, extremely slow and late... but it is the one that is close to me and no way , but without a doubt one of the worst in the whole country"	1 star
33221	"It is the third time we go at night and they don't let us in to eat. We always go before 10:00 pm, today we arrived at 10:05 pm and they literally slammed the door in our faces, and on the door it says it's until 11 pm. If you don't have dine in after 10 pm please change your hours on the website and at the door of the place!"	1 star
33222	The staff is rude. The facilities are not comfortable. They are very slow. The parking lot is small. The location is very good. It is close to the highway.	3 stars
33223	"I always return to this place because it is where they make the best ice coffee for me, some very friendly and polite shop assistants, thank you"	5 stars
33224	"the stencion is terrible, 10 people behind the counter and from so much they talk among themselves and laughing the line is very long, too young and arrogant for stencion public, the owner of that franchise should open his eyes a little and clean up the lazy that they do not work"	1 star
33225	"One star is too much
McDonalds very dirty staff useless in every way and I'm not talking about the sandwiches a shame"	1 star
33226	"Horrible experience. Good location, however the structure is terrible and disorganized. I waited almost 40 minutes for my order to be ready. The staff are nice, however the whole service is a mess."	1 star
33227	"They won't let me put zero stars, that's why I chose one and they don't deserve it. The worst MacDonald in the United States, they are a shame, the bad treatment they give to customers, I was in the second line, 3 cars passed by from the first and they didn't serve me When my turn came, they yelled at me because I ordered in Spanish. I asked to speak to the manager, he told me NO, then my 9-year-old daughter asked for her order in English and told her that she was not going to sell and said a bad word to her...I had I explained to the manager that they called him and in front of her he treated me badly for not speaking English, a very bad attitude from that person... how sad with so many people who need to work, they give work to people without education or respect..."	1 star
33228	"Incomprehensible things come across in the neck, they can                           t open the toilet and all the toilets are closed, you can                        "	1 star

33231	Excellent we love McDonald's fast service	5 stars
33232	"I asked for an order for delivery and received the opposite. I ordered a large milkshake, a small one arrived, and the chips that should be hot and crispy arrived cold and not at all crispy. Oh and they forgot my absorbent. The manager of the place needs to watch his workers because they are not doing their job well"	3 stars
33233	Very bad attention they yelled at me just for not understanding my language they should put only English so many of us would not go through such unpleasant moments	1 star

33239	nice place but bad is that most of the time you have to wait a long time for the food and the employees are not very friendly or attentive to customers and not to mention drive thru the wait is unbearable	3 stars
33240	"It is said that it is 24 hours a day but in truth it is between 8 AM and around 10 PM, I imagine it is for reasons of not having enough staff to work."	3 stars
33241	"You enter the bathroom and there is no soap to wash, there is no paper to clean yourself. The hamburger is good but they deliver it to you with the black lettuce, which for me is rotten. The fries are potato fries ..... I returned them twice because they taste like oil from 7 days ago ... very low"	1 star
33242	"1 hour waiting!!! And his second drive tru lane was useless! No one indicated anything or put a sign to say that it was useless! Horrible experience, worst Mcdonalds in FL!!! Apart from the zero friendly staff. Never come!"	1 star
33243	No one maintained hygiene standards... the person in charge did not make herself understood with the use of the language either. It was a bad service experience	1 star

33248	"Of all the stores of the Macdonals chain that I have visited, this is the slowest and without customer service. The lady that they must know that employee by employee number was very abusive with her way of attending, she was very closed in the explanation in the offer that she wanted, she argued that it is not her problem to explain but only to place orders, in mockery that she did not want order would cancel the order.. he fought because his service is like that... as if he was going to give me the order as a gift..."	2 stars
33249	"Terrible place, dirty, bad attention, slow. And to top it off, in the middle of summer there are no frozen drinks... with a silly excuse, since it's a business with so much money, don't they have to have several machines if one breaks to replace it?... in a business like McDONALD'S, Do they not have enough staff to apply customer service as it should be?"	1 star
33250	"Very slow, too slow"	1 star
33251	"Because the first time I use this service and they did not bring me 2 ice cream that I ordered and when I called to complain they do not answer or give explanations, and my nephew whenever he orders this service from his phone says that something is always missing and I did not know why If you were like that, I would not ask for this service, now is not the time to vote for money since the work is not good."	1 star
33252	"The food is good but the service is bad, nobody pays attention to you"	2 stars

33255	"A homeless person with a very bad smell opened it for me, we started off badly and inside there were several homeless people who were staring at our plates... sorry, it was NOT comfortable at all"	1 star
33256	"Terrible staff in general, I have never seen a worse McDonald's in my life. Super slow, 20 minutes on the clock to pay for the order since the payment kiosks did not work, without any order, without priority to attend to the payment, without smiling, they seemed bitter at work."	1 star

33258	"One of the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever seen. Its exterior and the withdrawal window looks all dirty!!
There is no maintenance at all.!!!
If that is the building, how will the kitchen be?"	1 star
33259	The employees lack customer service skills and are very slow preparing food. The self-service line was long and the attention inside was almost non-existent. The food was fine.	4 stars
33260	"It wasn't good this time, they gave me a box with melted cheese and I don't know what else instead of 4 chicken nuggets. Eye check your orders well before retiring from the window"	1 star
33261	"Ice cream... the air is so strong that it doesn't let you stay to eat something.
Orders are made with a machine... if one is a foreigner (as in my case) it is not fast enough and others wait.
I totally rescue the attention of a dispatcher ROBERT... attentive and speaks both Spanish and English... it was what best stayed in my memory..."	3 stars
33262	"Very bad place. Very bad place
The manager has an agreement with tows and takes the cars from customer parking, receives bribes from the tow company.

33263	Excellent atention. But the bathrooms are very neglected and the waste containers were completely full and there was no space for more. That part looks bad	3 stars
33264	"As an uber driver and delivery person today 29 10 2017 I received a delivery from that place for a client. I stay . At zero battery, but I take a current charger that I had in the car. I went to McDonald's I asked them to let me connect in the corridor to complete my order and they told me no. It couldn't end, I lost time and money, and I'm sorry for the customer and my uber company."	1 star
33265	"I remember this place perfectly. With my brother we went on vacation to the USA a few years ago, when we arrived at the hotel they told us that we didn't have the reservation made... We got scared!!! So we crossed paths and went to wait at this Mc. They treated us very kindly the whole time we were there. Super loving   "	5 stars
33266	"The one who seems to be the manager today, very unprofessional. Everyone talking and playing even physically and the work behind and unattended. Only the cashier did her work, although she also seems to be a manager because she had a shirt with stripes that was different from the others."	1 star
33267	"It is unpleasant that they are constantly towing cars in your parking lot and then the owners of the cars enter the premises claiming in an incorrect way, I understand that the parking lot is only yours for your clients like me but I think you should find another solution to this problem I think that behind all this there is a business with the grueros because I go to the place every day and on more than 10 occasions just someone parks their car and in a second the tow truck appears that they have hidden in the street behind the place, the service of the place is 5 stars I will continue visiting the place, perhaps they should make bigger signs in each parking lot that they should not leave the car in that place thanks for the opportunity of my comment because many times I have wanted to do it again thanks"	4 stars
33268	"I believe that there should be more empathy with the client and guide them in their order for those who do not know the menu, a smile does not hurt anyone"	3 stars
33269	"The worst experience, seeing how the supervisor denied a homeless person some fries for 25 cents. I am outraged by the lack of sensitivity on the part of the staff and seeing how they laughed at the situation! . The poor man did not go to ask or steal, he wanted to be able to eat with what he had. Shame. I will not go back to that McDonald restaurant."	1 star
33270	"A rather dirty place, the toilets were filthy.
We waited more than 20min to be served (fast food...)
Far from being the best McDonald's we've had..."	2 stars
33271	Whenever I go between 5am and 7am they always tell me the same thing that the system has gone and they don't want to sell. They should improve the attention and for that they should improve the supervision of this store	1 star
33272	"The coast is closer, so the MC is easily accessible! The shnake was delicious! The cheeseburger was also good!"	5 stars
33273	"The worst place, I left because it was impossible to talk to the attendant, because I don't speak English. In other places they make an effort and we understand each other but I think they discriminate against us Hispanics!!"	1 star
33274	"They are very arrogant, I took a coupon, and they gave me three options, I took the cheapest one and they sold me the most expensive one, so why offer me, and they spoke fast in English, so I couldn't understand them and, they could make fun of me"	1 star
33275	"The SLOWEST McDonald's I've ever met, I've never left a bad review on any restaurant AND I consider myself a person with incredible patience, but everything has its limit."	1 star
33276	I made an order through Uber eat and it took more than 1 hour and in the end I canceled the order because they never prepared it	1 star

33278	"~It seemed that the service was delayed despite the fact that there were not many people...otherwise, fine...clean and complying with health protocols...."	4 stars
33279	"There is something from Mac Donald's where there is no refilling, they serve you 90% ice and 10% soda. When you tell them that it's impossible to pay to have flavored ice, they tell you that you should have asked for it without ice.... unusual...they even ask you how you want to breathe and it turns out that the customer is to blame for something they don't expect to be served."	5 stars
33280	"It's very good, during the day there are older Latina ladies who are very cool, but not at night and the place is not so nice.
I'm surprised that McDonald's promotions in the USA are so bad."	4 stars

33295	"Quick or self-service attention according to preference, additionally some employees speak Spanish and English which makes the purchase process much easier"	5 stars
