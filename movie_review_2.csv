Rating,Review
0,"What's really lacking in The Lightning Thief is a genuine sense of wonder, the same thing that brings viewers back to Hogwarts over and over again."
0,It's more a list of ingredients than a movie-magic potion to enjoy from start to finish.
1,"Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references."
1,"Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display."
0,"For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one."
0,"Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan."
0,"When the movie slows down to catch its breath, there's very little of the heart and soul -- and wry wit -- that make the Riordan books so beloved."
0,"Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand."
1,You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation.
0,"This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book."
0,"Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations."
1,An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike.
1,"With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure."
0,Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder.
0,"Percy Jackson & the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is, instead, an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise."
0,The movie feels like a cut-rate Potter knockoff with a dash of Ray Harryhausen.
0,"In Columbus' hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn't headed anywhere new."
1,The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.
1,"The Lightning Thief isn't electric, but it generates some spark when it varies the Grecian formula."
0,"Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering."
1,Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands.
1,"Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales, but Percy Jackson is the opposite, overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour."
1,Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
0,"Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends."
0,"Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic."
0,"Percy Jackson, you are no Harry Potter. You are not fit to walk in a hobbit's wake."
0,"Harry, Ron and Hermione: Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs."
0,"The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness, all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects."
0,"Likable as Percy may be, it's not lightning he's stolen."
1,This is a kids' movie: Parents can either get into the silly-suspenseful spirit of it or play Rummikub on their iPhones.
0,All you have at the end of it is an enervating feeling of deja vu.
1,"Like its stars, the film is genial good company."
0,"Unfortunately, the movie lacks that good old Potter charm, trading Harry's dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans."
0,Some moments of inspired silliness save this escapist adventure from complete dullness.
1,"""It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief's market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults."
1,I thought it was mischievous and witty and amusing and I was just sort of drawn into it.
0,"It's not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on."
1,"Kids will love it, and adults may relish Pierce Brosnan's Centaur, and Steve Coogan as Hades - in his personal hell just under Hollywood."
0,A slab of market research in search of an actual movie.
0,Digitisation reigns - spectacular visual effects - while the dialogue drizzles and sploshes.
0,"If they'd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul."
0,This ineffably wooden Chris Columbus adaptation of author Rick Riordan's best-seller for young teens has a screenplay that defies description.
0,The Greek gods had outsized powers and petty grievances. These Gen-Y demigods are no different - it's a whole generation of kids with daddy issues
1,"Like Holofcener's previous pictures, Please Give derives its narrative energy less from a series of plotted incidents than from its keenly observed interplay of clashing personality tics and worldviews."
0,"A muted, almost Rohmer-like moral tale that doesn't quite dive deeply enough into its several characters."
1,"An edgy, somber, beautifully written Manhattan fable of guilt, shame, infidelity, death and real estate."
1,"It's a tricky kind of social satire, its possibly cloying self-absorption cut only by some winningly awkward characters."
1,An engagingly high-strung comedy about lack of empathy and the gnawing guilt that can attend it.
1,Holofcener's humorous interest in yupscale entitlem.ent and its discontents mark her as a descendant of Woody Allen
1,"[Holofcener] has real sympathy -- characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here."
0,"At a time when every penny counts, where do they come up with the money to finance a movie this boring?"
1,"Such fine-tuned observation requires the ideal interpreter. Keener has always been Holofcener's muse, and once again offers the sort of fully crafted portrait that reminds us how shallow most movies really are."
1,"With her new film, the poignant and funny Please Give, Holofcener is at the top of her game."
1,"Sometimes -- and far too rarely -- a film will hit all the right notes, with sharp, original dialogue, brilliant casting and an absorbing story. So caught up in its spell, you dread seeing the credits roll. Please Give is that movie."
1,Some people might find it distasteful to make a movie about guilty rich folks who give themselves permission to splurge. Others will rightly appreciate the honesty.
1,"One of the best movies of the year so far. An insightful, darkly funny and multi-layered character study about class and family."
1,"Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny, attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener."
0,Two possible ways of regarding Please Give: It's shallow. Or maybe it's deeply shallow.
1,"Please Give is Holofcener's best movie to date. The slender plot presents itself without fuss, a slice of Manhattan life, a la Woody Allen's early, most engaging work."
1,"This gorgeous film, always tender and sometimes dark, is a deeply resonant comic drama that's concerned with nothing less than life, death, love, sex, guilt and the urban logic of mortality."
0,"[Although] I think Holofcener's work is always interesting, I think this is the least satisfying of all her films I've seen."
1,"Brutally honest about the way people behave, and often devastatingly funny in its observations."
1,"Please Give is a moral comedy that feels at times like one of the late Eric Rohmer's deceptively breezy miniatures, or a mid-period Woody Allen movie - the fussiness."
1,"In its casual, disarming way, it's as deep and as grand a film as you'll find"
1,This is one of those rare movies that made me want to thank the person who did it.
1,"The movie is about imperfect characters in a difficult world, who mostly do the best they can under the circumstances, but not always. Do you realize what a revolutionary approach that is for a movie these days?"
1,"Please Give is a series of such set-piece scenes, a breezy, though not negligible, exploration of the contest between avarice and empathy."
0,Only Rebecca Hall comes through with a genuineness that rises above Holofcener's doodlings.
0,"Far from challenging, the film consoles the complacent, saying basically that you can do whatever you want, so long as you feel (or pretend to feel) a little guilty about it."
0,"Yet another ramble through the tiny world of the affluent and the idle, a particular fascination of Holofcener's. The only difference this time is the increased emphasis on morbidity."
1,Some filmmakers make movies that hold up a mirror to nature. Nicole Holofcener makes seriocomedies that hold up a magnifying glass to human nature.
1,There's no movie around right now with a subject more pertinent. It'll hit you hard.
1,Please Give is one of those movies that can be enjoyed simply for its funny portraits of human foibles and fumbling grasps at intimacy -- but it's also deceivingly profound.
1,"Nicole Holofcener is frequently lauded for writing vivid female characters, but such praise doesn't really do justice to her full game."
1,"Please Give is an almost perfectly rendered slice of life, buoyant with wonderful performances."
1,"While Please Give is a film about conscience, it's also slyly funny, with piercing moments of insight and warmth."
1,"In a Holofcener film, the usual rules of screenwriting do not apply, which lends her work a lifelike quality that's particularly refreshing in this era of formulaic remakes and sequels."
1,"Happily, the joy outweighs the guilt."
1,"Holofcener's biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego."
1,"Three dimensional characters, direct no nonsense dialogue and a dry sense of humour combine to create an understated thoroughly enjoyable feel-good film that leaves viewers with an invisible glow."
1,"Nicole Holofcener's lovely Please Give is a small, modest movie, full of the sort of characters we might know, or be."
1,"Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted."
1,"It sparks laughter by crossing the wires of human motivation, letting you see the hazards that exist in trying to be a good person."
1,"Life-goes-on movies usually don't electrify the senses, but this one stimulates moral imagination."
1,"Keener has become Holofcener's artistic alter ego. In Please Give, the sharp-eyed filmmaker sends her vibrant representative out into the world to explore what it means for a woman to be lucky and still feel itchy."
1,"Nicole Holofcener, who writes the most interesting female characters in the movies, delivers another dazzling role to her muse, Catherine Keener, in Please Give, a delightfully dry dramedy about guilt."
0,
1,"Blake Edwards's 10 is perhaps the first comedy about terminal yearning. Like all great comedies, it deals with emotions very close to our hearts."
0,"A sporadically funny, marginally interesting fiasco that might have evolved into a memorable romantic comedy."
1,"This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action."
1,"Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound."
1,A strangely realistic thriller.
1,"Mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods."
1,The film leaves a tremendous impact.
1,"Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily."
1,"The talky 20,000 Leagues probably won't thrill kids fresh from The Matrix, but they may be interested to know that the Verne film was the effects marvel of its day."
1,"As fabulous and fantastic as anything he has ever done in cartoons is Walt Disney's 'live action' movie made from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."
1,"This is one of the great movie adventures, fully deserving its canonisation in Disney World."
1,"Walt Disney's production of 20000 Leagues under the Sea is very special kind of picture, combining photographic ingenuity, imaginative story telling and fiscal daring."
1,Grandly entertaining.
0,"It's best not to think too hard about anything in 10,000 BC, a sublimely dunderheaded excursion into human prehistory."
0,"While the movie is completely ridiculous, at least it's fun to think of all the high school students who are going to mistake this movie for an accurate historical record and get F's on their next pop quiz."
0,"Emmerich knows how to fill the screen with spectacle, but not how to field-marshal it."
1,"Digital imagery imagines a striking prehistoric world for these back-to-basics heroes, villains and raging beasts."
0,"An epic adventure of such towering testosterone counts and ceaseless tedium, you can almost feel the hair growing on your chest as the bags collect beneath your eyes."
0,"Rather than taking the trouble to imagine what early civilization might have been like -- its culture, its language, its warfare, its family life -- the movie simply transposes a banal Hollywood epic into Paleolithic times."
0,"A mix of vast CGI spectacle and small, silly moments, the prehistoric saga 10,000 BC is an epic in name only."
0,"Conventional where it should be bold and mild where it should be wild, 10,000 BC reps a missed opportunity to present an imaginative vision of a prehistoric moment."
1,"Sometimes you have a hankering for a slab of 10,000-year-old cheese. Here it is, on a cracker."
0,"One part Joseph Campbell hero quest, one part multi-culti morality tale, one part live-action Flintstones cartoon, 10,000 B.C. is finally every part just plain nuts."
0,"This much-delayed film cries out for consideration for Worst CGI, Most Annoying Narrator, Lamest Dialogue and Dumbest Action Hero."
0,Even a cameo by Pauly Shore in Encino Man would liven up this bombastic bore.
0,"10,000 BC would be much better if it allowed itself the freedom to be kitsch."
0,"The best acting comes from woolly mammoths, man-eating ostriches and a saber-toothed tiger -- and those babies are digital. It's the human actors who look fake."
0,"10,000 B.C. isn't only brain-dead, it's completely dead. It's inert and without a heartbeat."
0,Where's Raquel Welch in that fur bikini?
0,Yabba-dabba-don't.
0,"While the special effects are top notch... the humans are dull, the dialogue is ridiculous, and anyone expecting a repeat of the action in 300 is going to be sorely disappointed with this bloodless PG-13 adventure."
0,"The less said about historical accuracy, the better."
1,"Outrageous and outlandish, Emmerich's 10,000 BC is easy to mock, but it is so cheerfully shameless and terminally silly that you have to admire its effrontery and accept its creator... as a certified crackpot visionary."
0,"The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches, perhaps inspired by ancient phorusrhacid fossils, are idiotic but... okay, they're idiotic."
0,"If you thought 300 was silly, think of 10,000 BC as 33.333 times sillier."
0,Barney Rubble had a lot more charisma than anyone involved in this movie.
0,"You may be expecting a showcase of cutting-edge visuals -- isn't the appeal of the title the implicit promise of seeing a lost world re-created to presumably dazzling effect? But for the most part, it's just barren landscapes and people in animal skins."
0,It made me yearn to see Caveman again. At least that was intentionally funny.
0,Overblown and stupefyingly dull.
0,"[I] saith to you that I had a strangely good time, and whether that is from laughing at 10,000 B.C. or laughing with it I knoweth not, although I strongly suspect the former."
0,The film proves to be uncharacteristically restrained.
0,Would that Emmerich took as much care with his human characters as with inanimate objects and CGI animals.
0,"Neither grand enough to be impressive nor antic enough to be charming, the movie settles for bland and frantic, climaxing in a showdown among decadent pyramid builders."
1,"Roland Emmerich's prehistoric odyssey 10,000 BC is his silliest, most preposterous blockbuster to date. But it's lots of fun, too."
0,Roland Emmerich's great big CGI blockbuster lumbers along like one of the woolly mammoths that roam across the screen.
0,"Don't expect Roland Emmerich's 10,000BC to make much sense, historically, geographically or logically."
1,Take the kids along; unless you want them to grow up to be palaeontologists.
0,"Like the lumbering mammoths, it is plodding and dull."
0,It's a horrible movie.
0,
1,If you can imagine Anatole France writing a detective story you will have some notion of the artistry that Hitchcock brings to this screen version of John Buchan's novel.
1,Great fun.
1,"As an artist, Alfred Hitchcock surpassed this early achievement many times in his career, but for sheer entertainment value it still stands in the forefront of his work."
1,"It's melodrama and at times far-fetched and improbable, but the story twists and spins artfully from one high-powered sequence to another while the entertainment holds like steel cable from start to finish."
1,"In Hitchcock's hands, however, this well-known espionage adventure provided the basis for a new sort of thriller and a new sort of comedy."
1,The Thirty-Nine Steps neatly converts its essential implausihility into an asset by stressing the difficulties which confront its hero when he tries to tell outsiders about the predicament he is in.
1,"The scene in which Mr Memory is asked at the London Palladium ""What are the 39 Steps?"" remains one of 20th-century cinema's most gripping moments."
1,The 39 Steps is a masterclass in propulsive narrative cinema that even today's so-called blockbuster auteurs should study.
1,"Despite an abundance of talk, this 1957 film is often considered [Daves'] best."
1,"It's of necessity a talkative film, with Ford working on Heflin's nerves in a stream of Machiavellian banter, but one held in perfect balance by Daves, who keeps the tension strung taut."
1,This is a first-rate action picture -- a respectable second section to High Noon.
0,"That the climax fizzles must be laid on doorstep of Halsted Welles, who adapts Elmore Leonard's story quite well until that point."
1,"A portrait of storytelling made for and by the Silent Generation, an audience all too familiar with the world's spooky, white-knuckled moral twilight."
1,The compositions evoke a kind of open-air claustrophobia ...
1,Abraham Lincoln is a startlingly superlative accomplishment.
1,"Working with the sort of mythic material later associated with John Ford, Griffith gives us a primordial Lincoln, perfectly incarnated by Walter Huston, and a dreamlike sense of destiny that his camera fully articulates."
1,It is quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President.
1,"D. W. Griffith's first sound film, from 1930, is as ungainly and majestic as its subject."
1,
1,"It's flawed, but you should see Dark Water, a decent little chiller that brings a whole new meaning to rising damp."
1,Its cleverness relies on transferring our concern from the supernatural events emanating from one lost child to the natural fear of a mother losing her own child to the other world.
1,The Accused demonstrates that rape victims often are suspects in their own cases.
0,"Despite the strong emotional connection many Miamians will feel toward the movie, The Lost City falls far short of the sweep, complexity and passion it strives for."
0,"Somewhere inside this overlong, sometimes engaging, often tedious affair, there may be a solid, 100-minute movie."
0,"Staged with credibility and loads of Cubano flair, the film slows to a sludgy crawl, giving us lots of time to consider it as a pro-old-guard, anti- revolutionary elegy."
0,"... it's too long, politically confusing and painfully self-indulgent, loaded with too many tertiary characters and darting from one subplot to the next like a butterfly with hiccups."
1,"A lot goes wrong in this overlong movie, but it has a human touch."
0,... a lost movie that seems like it takes 16 years to end.
0,"How the movie's politics will sit with the audience aside, one of the problems in this overlong melodrama is the distracting casting of Bill Murray as a wisecracking sidekick and Dustin Hoffman as mobster Meyer Lansky."
0,"The Lost City manages to make Havana, Sydney Pollack's disastrous 1990 attempt at a Casablanca homage set against the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford, look good by comparison."
0,... a haphazard jumble.
0,... a romantic epic manque that swoons across the screen for nearly two and a half hours without saying much ...
1,"Garcia, who fled the country with his family as a young boy, obviously has a fierce passion for this material, and he knows to his very soul."
0,"As a director, Garcia is such a sucker for gratuitous crosscutting and glossily elliptical filmmaking that viewers can be forgiven for mistaking Lost City for a 143-minute montage sequence."
1,"Throbbing with music, seething with anger and romance, The Lost City is a film that breaks your heart, bewilders, alienates and ravishes you by turns."
0,"The Lost City has a subject, a setting and a historical backdrop, but in the foreground it has a relatively passive protagonist, Fico, whose passions are understated and whose fortunes inspire only minor concern."
1,"Feels like the distillation of countless conversations and family legends, rehearsed from time immemorial by Cubans who fled their homeland and sought to re-create it in their memories."
0,It's the sort of epic that aspires to tell Cuba's modern political history and celebrate its people without introducing us to a single believable character.
1,"A tribute to pre-revolutionary Havana, an elegy on what was lost, a little payback for a regime that drove his family out and, best of all, a synthesis of the driving Afro-Cuban rhythms of the extraordinary music."
1,"As a musical fever dream of paradise lost, The Lost City is a flawed success, boasting just enough truth and admirable purpose to justify the hazards of Garcia's passion."
0,"The film suggests a dutiful if clunky pastiche of The Godfather and a right-wing Reds, with Fellove and his brothers and parents representing a spectrum of possible responses to the Cuban revolution."
0,"Though the filmmaker's feel for his Cuban heritage is bone-deep, it's a glazed and dolorous movie -- a depressed epic."
1,"Lovely to look at, and its mixture of Cuban standards and Garcia originals is delightful to listen to."
0,"Somewhere amid the bric-a-brac -- hot rhythms, ocean breezes and political upheaval and melodrama -- a movie languishes. Garcia never really finds it."
0,"A pretty bauble, a trinket offered when the stakes of barter were life and death."
0,"It's barely coherent as it is, but at 2 hours and 23 minutes, The Lost City is simply infuriating."
0,"Too scattered, too confused, too patched-together to work dramatically."
0,The movie has too many stories to tell and tells none of them very well.
0,"Turgid, lumpy and almost unwatchably dull."
0,"Unfortunately, Garcia is inept as a director. His scenes are shapeless and bloated with self-important speeches."
1,Unsteady but often entrancing.
0,"Somehow simultaneously too much and not enough. At 143 minutes, it well overstays its welcome as a movie, but with a little more fleshing out it might have worked as a miniseries."
0,"It's handsome and heartfelt but mired in murky politics, plot inertia, musical montages and painfully pointed symbolism."
0,Garcia needed better guiding hands and eyes in the editing room to jettison the many parts that bog down the story.
1,"When it succeeds, the film conveys a bittersweet longing for a lost moment and the unfulfilled promise of a democratic Cuba."
0,"'The Lost City' is intriguing as a historical document and adequate as cinema, but it has a blandness at its core that no amount of spicy mambo and booty-quaking dance routines can disguise."
0,"Andy Garcia's preposterous vanity project The Lost City is an all-singing, all-dancing version of the Cuban Revolution."
0,"The script is scrupulously even-handed, but Garcia can't seem to get a grip on this sprawl."
0,"Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away."
1,The Breaking Point is crackling good drama.
1,Of Adam's Rib we might say...that it isn't solid food but it certainly is meaty and juicy and comically nourishing.
1,The performances (not least from Wayne and Hagen) are matchless.
1,"The film is a classic, and deservedly so: the conjunction of Tracy's sly listlessness and Hepburn's stridency defines 'chemistry' in the movies."
1,"Adam's Rib is a bright comedy success, belting over a succession of sophisticated laughs."
1,Katharine Hepburn conveys an extraordinary abundance of spirit.
1,Adam's Rib is one of the smartest comedies in years. It is a welcome return to the sophisticated spoofing that Hollywood seemed to have forgotten.
0,"Even though director-adaptor Mary McGuckian expended much creative energy trying to pump original spirit into the characters, she never brings any of them to life."
0,"Unlike the bridge, the movie unravels at a very slow pace."
0,"The stellar cast can do little to paper over the cracks in an awkward, unevenly-paced script that is composed of a series of sometimes-attractive scenes with little emotional undertow."
0,"Visually sumptuous but dramatically muddled and confusing, The Bridge of San Luis Rey ultimately comes across as a soporific costume drama featuring a gallery of miscast stars."
0,The Bridge of San Luis Rey raises an important philosophical question: Is it better to fall to one's death from a rickety rope bridge overlooking a deep gorge or watch this miserable movie about several people sharing that awful fate?
0,An endless powdered-wigs-and-feathered-pen slog.
0,So dully written and executed that you'll be wishing the production had collapsed instead of the swaying bridge of San Luis Rey.
0,"How bad could a movie be that features talent as serious as Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates, Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham and Geraldine Chaplin? That bad, alas."
0,An honorable but dull attempt to translate a neglected literary source to the screen.
0,"Audiences may wonder why a picture with Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates and Harvey Keitel would be so bereft of hype. After you've endured the film, all 120 airless minutes, you'll understand the rationale behind the quiet release."
0,"As a director, McGuckian is overwhelmed by the immensity of her cast, and her misguided attempt to make a Hollywood epic on a European production budget."
0,Best characterized as an honourable folly.
0,"Why do good actors pop up in bad movies? More perplexingly, why do so many good actors end up in the same bad movie?"
1,Losey rises magnificently to the occasion in his use of the Mojave Desert ghost town location.
1,"A bawdy, daring story."
1,The Prowler may be the creepiest of classic noirs.
1,"This hallucinatory film noir is still, for me, Joseph Losey's best film."
1,
1,"It's really a quick, deft analysis of a kind of world where corruption and easy answers are on the advance."
0,"The movie was made just four years ago by Argentinian director Fabian Bielinsky. It is called Nine Queens, and it is vastly superior to this blah U.S. remake from director Gregory Jacobs."
1,"The result isn't as compelling as Nine Queens, but it's a respectable caper movie in the tradition of The Sting and David Mamet's Heist."
1,"If you missed the original, Criminal is a reasonable facsimile."
1,"We know someone is pulling something, and someone is going to get away with something, and someone is going to be left holding the bag of cheese, but Jacobs keeps us on our toes."
1,John C. Reilly stars as a gimlet-eyed con man in this clever and diverting adaptation of the Argentine thriller Nine Queens.
1,"It's all done with sufficient style that, when we get there, the end no longer feels like the point."
1,Criminal does what every good con-game movie should: It keeps you guessing.
1,Criminal is the sort of movie David Mamet would love -- or make.
1,"It's hip, witty and fun, and will remind you why movies are made in the first place."
1,It's an auspicious debut for first-timer Gregory Jacobs.
1,Fans of con-man capers will have no regrets after watching Criminal.
0,"Although Criminal retains its source material's cleverness and intricate plotting, something seems to have been lost in the translation."
1,"The performances are winning -- Gyllenhaal is particularly sharp as an aggrieved sibling, and there's mutual zing in her scenes with Reilly."
0,An exercise where viewers are likely to ponder not 'How did the characters do it?' but 'Who cares?'
1,Reilly and Luna make a chemically appealing screen team.
1,"Jacobs -- who for many years was Soderbergh's assistant director -- keeps things moving at a sprightly pace, and cinematographer Chris Menges does a terrific job of capturing L.A. in all its mercurial glory."
1,"Maybe watching Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal is quite enough entertainment value for any movie."
0,The problems lie not with the actors but with a glib approach that exposes the flaws of the original story.
1,Those unfamiliar with Fabian Bielinsky's 2002 film will delight to this delicious deviousness.
0,"The constant shadow of doubt keeps the viewer from investing in the characters, because we suspect one or more of them isn't what they seem."
0,"In a way, the whole movie is a con job -- offering an inferior copy of something that wasn't too wonderful to begin with, while pretending that it has something new and stylish to sell."
1,"Doesn't exactly reinvigorate an overworked genre, but neither does it disgrace the format or the original movie."
1,A breathless and dazzling caper that knocks your socks off.
1,"It's such a pleasure being in the company of these actors as they work with character-rich material that if they burst into the audience and swindled us out of our wallets, we would gladly oblige."
0,"It's a listless, dutiful affair -- a cover version played out of obligation, not inspiration."
0,The disparity between Richard and Rodrigo is too great and the impossible coincidences of the ending are too far-fetched.
0,This is the kind of movie so full of coincidence and double crosses that you simply don't have the mental energy to go back and sort it all out at the end.
1,"Some snappy dialogue, fine performances and lots of shady atmosphere give Criminal a tasty B-movie flavor."
1,"What elevates Criminal into a delicious con in the league of Red Rock West, House of Games or Matchstick Men is John C. Reilly."
0,"Follows the original fairly closely, and because I already knew the plot secrets, it couldn't work on me in its intended way. As the recycled characters, dialog and events turned up, there seemed to be an echo in the room."
1,Reilly sheds a career playing dupes and schlubs and gives his first full-tilt electric performance.
1,"Jacobs has brought the barrio into noir, and that's no small achievement. If nothing else, it opens the door to a whole new galaxy of grift."
1,... unfolds like a David Mamet film ...
1,"With dashes of black humour and pointed glimpses of the American class system, Criminal is a taut con-versus-con game whose deft artistry isn't fully revealed until the last few minutes."
1,"A kind of who-done-what? puzzle. You'll probably enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the 2002 Argentine film, Nine Queens."
0,"Everything looks soft, squashy and sort of ugly."
1,"Taking us from God's-eye-views of the sparkling surface to the darkest depths, this ocean odyssey conveys a riveting sense of nature's infinite variety."
1,"Practically every shot in Deep Blue offers some sort of remarkable, jaw-dropping sight."
0,Those looking for a refresher course on the workings of the food chain should be in heaven. All others may yearn for a sushi break.
1,"Numerous films have explored undersea life, but few as comprehensively and as consistently compelling as Deep Blue."
0,Alternately mind-blowing and mind-numbing.
0,"Deep Blue is a beautiful movie, nicely scored and elegantly shot. But it's all about as thrilling as a good aquarium."
0,It's about half an hour too long and Pierce Brosnan's sonorous narration threatens to lull us to sleep on those rocking waves.
0,A beautiful but empty-headed documentary about the creatures that lurk in the sea.
1,"These iridescent oddities are pure science fiction, and they gave the grade-schooler in me a good 'Whoa!'"
1,This is as good a visual treat as you and your kids can expect.
0,"Even with consistently impressive camerawork, the movie still feels like the visual equivalent of elevator music -- with frolicking dolphins instead of Elton John ballads."
1,"A better action movie than most of what you'll see this summer, and there are certainly more visceral thrills."
1,This majestic film has all the hallmarks of Beeb quality workmanship.
1,"If nature films had genres, Deep Blue would be an action movie."
1,A sumptuous but occasionally soporific nature documentary.
0,"This is a nasty, nauseating, dispiriting movie and, to repeat, whatever you do, don't take the kids -- no matter what the G rating says."
1,"A magnificent look at the teeming, wildly varied life in and around the ocean."
1,Absorbing.
1,"Few storybooks have been more brilliantly brought to life, page for page, chapter for chapter, derring-do for derring-do."
1,"Movie pageantry at its best, done in the grand manner of silent spectacles, brimming over with the sort of primitive energy that drew people to the movies in the first place."
1,"Sumptuous and highly energetic, The Adventures of Robin Hood is grand with a capital 'G' on every level."
1,"In these cynical days when swashbucklers cannot be presented without an ironic subtext, this great 1938 film exists in an eternal summer of bravery and romance."
1,One of the few great adventure movies that you can pretend you are treating the kids to when you are really treating yourself.
1,Movies like this are beyond criticism.
1,"It is cinematic pageantry at its best, a highly imaginative telling of folklore in all the hues of Technicolor."
1,"If prankish Fairbanks was a man's Robin Hood, handsome, romantic Flynn performs for everybody else."

1,The band's perfectly mediocre pop (written and laid down by real musicians) accompanies a story that's both dramatic and hilarious.
0,Whore isn't titillating enough to appeal to the raincoat crowd nor weighty enough to warrant serious appraisal.
0,"The subjects can be amusing, chilling, or tragic -- but in the end, they offer few surprises."
0,"Whore, directed by the Spanish filmmaker who uses the pseudonym Luna, is a tedious, not-at-all titillating exploitation film."
0,A shallow film.
0,This relationship lacks a critical ingredient: passion.
0,"Franco's curly locks may make the target audience swoon, but his presence never allows the rest of us to completely sink into Tristan & Isolde."
0,"Well, I just had this weird feeling that things weren't going to work out for them. But even though you can see it coming, this director Kevin Reynolds just makes the whole thing drag on and on and on and on."
1,"Tristan & Isolde is gorgeous to watch. The film's cinematography shines as a stunning example of setting, costumes, choreography and visual mood. And the story is entertaining, epic in scope but without an interminable length."
1,"There is something undeniably pleasant about an entertainment like Tristan & Isolde that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more."
1,"Though Reynolds' film tops two hours (which in a season of epics seems almost trim), he keeps the action brisk."
1,"Tristan has its slightly silly moments, but rather like those fondly remembered epics of Hollywood past, its energy and entertainment value carry the day."
0,"Mindless, predictable and mildly entertaining."
0,"At its core is a pair of lovers no contemporary audience could possibly care for, and at the periphery are characters that threaten to become interesting but never quite do."
1,"The knights and ladies don't look like escapees from a Prince Valiant comic strip, but like physical, vulnerable, survivors of the conflicts left behind by the Romans."
0,It's just a pretty valentine with no real heart.
1,A handsomely produced and sporadically rousing re-retelling of the ancient Celtic legend about star-crossed lovers.
0,"The movie plods around, appears to pick up speed, but then falters. Worse, we never feel true sympathy for the lovers who are forced to risk all to meet in secret when fate and politics keep them apart."
1,"While Tristan & Isolde, a competent but uninspired film version of the legendary medieval romance, will likely fade from theaters and memories quickly, Myles' lovely face and spirited performance should linger."
0,We don't find a tale of transcendent passion but rather of two vain nitwits in a case of routine attraction.
0,"The story itself -- Tristan falls in love with Isolde first, only to see her married off as part of a cold-hearted peace treaty -- is merely dreary, full of overwrought villainy and thuggish jousting."
0,"Trying to underplay things, the actors practically sleepwalk. When someone finally gets the chance to shout, 'Seize him!' he does so with as much gusto as the guy who says, 'WINS news time: 8:45.'"
0,It's that rare movie that had me wishing I was at the opera.
1,"Tristan & Isolde is deadly serious, straightforward and surprisingly entertaining tragedy that reinforces much of what we think we know about the Dark Ages in Britain."
0,There's far more smiting than smooching -- more hewing of limbs than heaving of bosoms.
0,"Sorry, no magic here."
0,"In the end, Tristan & Isolde is never painful. It's just a bit of a dull blade."
0,This Tristan is strictly for those who prefer their romantic melodrama bloodied up a bit.
1,Franco looks appropriately troubled as Tristan. Myles is pretty and sweet enough to win hearts as Isolde.
0,"The fate of two nations hinges on the nondisclosure of the stolen kisses and secret trysts. But, boy, could I have not cared less."
0,"Tristan & Isolde wants to be an epic, but it has all the weight of a high school play."
1,"I can wholeheartedly recommend Tristan & Isolde, even to those who don't have a penchant for period piece romances. The movie has a lot to offer."
1,I dub thee tolerable.
1,"A serious, old-fashioned, history-heavy romance."
0,It's so cheesy and corny.
0,"The two leads, James Franco and Sophia Myles, generate a modicum of chemistry, despite being penned in by a clunky script."
0,Pretty and rather dull.
0,"Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat."
0,[Tristan and Isolde] moves so sluggishly that someone must have been dosing the cast and crew with Nyquil.
1,Strikes a good balance between action and romance in this version of the medieval legend.

0,Auds might do better having this one delivered.
0,Innocuous but forgettable.
0,"Amid all the discussion of crust and sauce and the proper consistency of each, A Tale of Two Pizzas lays on the cheese way too thick."
0,"Any way you slice it, A Tale of Two Pizzas is so ineptly written and directed that it's pretty soggy entertainment."
1,"Though it bears absolutely no relation to real life, this sweetly silly modern fairy tale possesses just enough charm to endear itself to secret sentimentalists."
0,"The filmmaker whose work this most resembles is Guy Ritchie, except that Kramer actually seems to be taking himself seriously"
0,"By the time this Malice in Wonderland reaches an inevitable crescendo, it's enough to make one want to hurry home and soak in a vat of Purell."
0,"A giddily awful, awfully giddy action noir."
0,"It's lower on the food chain than a mere exploitation picture because it clings so desperately to the notion that it's a serious movie about violence; it doesn't even have enough integrity to serve up cheap, sick thrills for their own sake."
0,A potential howler done in by a tendency to wear too much body tissue on its sleeve.
1,"In the gleefully violent Running Scared, the writer and director Wayne Kramer tries to go over the rainbow and put a self-consciously bloody spin on once upon a time."
1,"With a complex plot that unspools with surprising clarity, Running Scared displays a reckless intensity."
0,"The hallucinatory crime thriller Running Scared, written and directed by Wayne Kramer, is pretty awful."
1,"Running Scared goes so far over the top, it circumnavigates the top and doubles back on itself; it's the Mobius Strip of over-the-topness. I am in awe."
0,"Everything feels begged, borrowed and stolen from other better movies, from Quentin Tarantino's exclamation-point violence to the slo-mo bullet trajectory shots from The Matrix."
1,"If Running Scared sometimes looks like a storyboard sprung violently to life, Kramer's assured direction turns that into its greatest strength in the clinches, of which there are plenty."
0,It's like a gruesome merry-go-round filled with unpleasant characters and bad acting.
0,"If it's possible to admire his movie's heedless energy, it's also possible to hate its guts."
0,This is the kind of movie where character development consists of a guy mentioning in passing he has a meth lab in his back yard.
0,"Ethnic stereotyping, moral qualms and plot improbabilities aside, you just wish a movie like Running Scared wasn't so anxious to be exciting all the time: It gets so monotonous."
0,"There's clearly supposed to be tension between Joey's good and bad sides. Sure, he's a mobster, but he's also a family man, which makes him... gray. (Not black and white = very sophisticated.)"
0,"In the opening minutes of Running Scared, a drug deal goes bad and takes the entire movie with it."
0,"There is a child at the center of this ultraviolent story, and the devices used to keep us on tenterhooks regarding his survival are appallingly manipulative."
1,"A ferociously energetic piece of filmmaking, Running Scared makes the seedy Vegas milieu of writer-director Wayne KramerWayne Kramer's first feature, The Cooler, look as tasteful as The Sound of Music."
1,"Running Scared is for people who like movies, who don't need to have a movie mean something in order to enjoy it and who can delight at the sheer craft of a story designed only to shock, amuse and hold an audience."
1,"It's borderline irresponsible, a virtual horror movie of a gangster thriller."
0,"Kramer seems to be aping Quentin Tarantino's brilliant tangents in Pulp Fiction, but he doesn't have Tarantino's imagination or gift for dialogue."
0,This overlong fantasy of urban violence is so far over the top -- you might as well be watching a computer monitor while somebody else has a high time playing the video game Grand Theft Auto.
1,"Running Scared is a vicious and brutal B-movie jacked up to hysterical, hallucinatory proportions -- a pulpy, violent action picture that torments the viewer as much as its characters, and I mean that as a compliment."
0,"As the movie becomes more howlingly ludicrous by the second, it's tempting -- and not in a cynical way, either -- to start reading it as a parody of pornographic video game violence."
0,"But even beyond its sleazy pandering and sensationalism, the film's worst transgression is its exploitation of young children."
1,"An exhilarating bloodbath of a film, Running Scared may not be perfect, but it's got adrenaline, wild eyes and sleaze to spare."
0,Running Scared is not only toxic but irresponsible in the way it exposes young characters to a steady barrage of sleaze and violence.
0,"Running Scared is about as hard an ""R"" rating as you can get, with buckets of blood, full- frontal nudity and swearing that would peel gum from the sidewalk."
0,"A depressing piece of gun-crazy Hollywood scuzz that, with its gassy style and runaway immorality, makes a Tony Scott movie look like a Robert Bresson picture."
0,Filmmaking for people who find the films of Guy Ritchie too understated and wish Natural Born Killers weren't so slow-paced and minimalist.
0,It's ugly and it's vile and it's disgusting and it's creepy and it just got tiresome.
0,It says something when the most sympathetic character is a kid who shoots his dad with a stolen pistol.
1,"The end result of all these cross-mob confrontations is an orgy of nihilistic violence that is curiously exhilarating, I am almost ashamed to say."
0,"Presumably patterned after Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, but substantially more graphic, there is surely an audience for this empty brutality, but you would not want to know anyone to whom this picture appeals."
0,"No one in their right minds could call this a good film, but it's certainly unique."
1,
0,"We haven't even mentioned the hockey puck torture scene, or the relentless ricochetting camerawork, or the multiple last minute switcheroos -- it's got more endings than Lord Of The Rings."
0,"With audiences jaded by the usual sex and splatter, do the filmmakers have no qualms about juicing up proceedings with edgy but troubling material which clearly needs more conscientious handling? Apparently not."
0,The landscape will survive this desecration; it's questionable whether the actors will.
0,"An inexplicably dated, sexist Porky's knock-off."
0,The special effects simply thrust Ultraviolet in an Xbox 360 for action set-pieces that are kinetic and colorful but surprisingly unexciting. Do we really care if she dies when she's just going to be regenerated anyway?
0,"Ultraviolet wants desperately to be a provocative, high-concept action thriller. It is apparently trying to say something about fear and terrorism, paranoia and racism. But it looks more like a shampoo commercial."
0,"The tale, beginning with narrated flashbacks that make it curiously seem like a sequel, essentially is an excuse for a seemingly endless series of ultraviolet, uh, ultraviolent, action scenes."
0,"Wimmer has created no logical framework for flashy, ultraviolent and frankly cheesy sequences."
0,"Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping that's so total -- Sony's top-flight high-def cameras, visibly low-budget CG work, exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue --that it arrives a nearly lifeless film."
0,"Whether Six is a blessing or a boon to mutants or humans is one of the many things that are not clearly explained through all the flying bodies, flashing steel and grinding metal."
0,"Ultrastupid, ultra-incoherent, ultrasilly -- and way, way ultraboring."
0,Ultraviolet cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.
0,Wimmer ain't no Cassavetes.
0,"Uwe Boll would be proud of this movie. It's pretentious and oh-so-serious. The tone of the movie is one of high art, but it stinks like a landfill."
0,The Yule log was way more entertaining.
0,"It's not bad enough to be funny, but it's not without its moments. Most of those come when Jovovich, not the best with a catch-phrase, answers some challenge with a put-down she should have practiced more in between personal trainer sessions."
0,"Her sword is red, her eyes are blue and her movie is horrible."
0,Wimmer borrows all his best ideas from other movies...then spackles over his half-assed plot with a shiny aesthetic.
0,Crank your brain to its lowest possible idle and you'll still overthink Ultraviolet.
0,Ultra-dumb.
0,The only redeeming feature is a production design so outrageously mad that you will genuinely have no idea what you're watching for more than half the time.
0,"Some spectacular action, though obviously digital: free of risk, free of drama."
0,"Derivative, adolescent tosh."
0,"Despite the expository speeches draped over this like birthday bunting, the story remains largely incomprehensible."
0,"The most receptive audience will mainly be enlightened to know that you can make a movie as thoroughly unprofessional as this one and still get it released in 3,000 theaters."
1,"A serenely powerful, handcrafted film that navigates into a place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once called 'the tangled discords of our nation.'"
1,"It is a film that should be required viewing by all citizens, especially students, if we hope not to repeat this awful chapter."
1,"This doc recounting the tragic story of Viola Liuzzo, the only white woman killed during the civil rights struggle, doubles as a narrative of the nascent women's movement."
1,"Paola di Florio's poignant documentary tells the freshly outraging story of Viola Liuzzo, a white woman who was killed while volunteering with the civil rights movement."
0,There is altogether too much footage of daughter Mary wallowing in her mother's martyrdom.
1,"Paola di Florio's haunting documentary about Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit civil rights worker murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965 Alabama, adds to the case for ripping J. Edgar Hoover's name off the FBI building in Washington."
1,Home of the Brave... will make you want to stand up for what you believe in.
0,The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film. As overproduced and acrid as The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc and The Fifth Element.
0,Besson drags things out considerably for his young audience at 122 minutes. The CG work is clever but cannot measure up to Pixar's standards in cleverness or imagination. Nothing is fresh here.
0,"Director Luc Besson admits he knew nothing about animation before he started this project, and it shows."
1,"Predictable and overly busy, this sci-fi adventure should nonetheless appeal to game-savvy tots, especially those familiar with the source material."
0,"Luc Besson, the most-Hollywoodish of Gallic directors, has adapted his own series of popular (in France) kid-lit tomes to produce a glossy, expensive ($84 million) and long-winded mix of live action and computer animation."
0,"A mishmash with a distinctive but disorderly animation palette whose top-notch voice cast -- including Robert De Niro, Madonna and David Bowie -- gets lost in the muck."
0,"This children's epic is slowed considerably by a convoluted, multi-tiered plotline in which we bounce between the human world and the Minimoy one. None of the characters are compelling, despite the star-studded vocal cast behind them."
0,"There's no time to sort out the players or the story as things rush ahead at an overwrought pace. Huge amounts of backstory are just plopped down in front of us, so fast and furiously that it makes little sense."
1,"It's a pretty good picture, albeit a strange one."
0,"Arthur and the Invisibles makes an excellent case against casting animated movies with celebrity voices. There are people who make their living as voiceover artists, and they would have been infinitely better than the lackluster Robert De Niro."
1,"Luc Besson has never been one of my favorite filmmakers, but he seems to have found his metier in children's fantasy, and this semianimated adventure is enjoyable and imaginative despite its formulaic qualities."
0,"While technically polished and adequately executed Arthur, like most of Besson's movies, is a strangely soulless experience."
0,"Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies, but this part live, part animation effort is a mess, highlighted by creepy animation, derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast."
0,Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy who shrinks to microscopic size to find his missing grandfather.
0,[Arthur and the Invisibles is] a film for kids who want to know what headaches feel like.
0,"There's a reason American animated filmmakers don't use the great Robert De Niro, Jason Bateman and Madonna to voice their cartoons. These big names add nothing to this frustrating goulash of fairy tales and fantasy-film ingredients."
0,This kids' cartoon from France is such a surreally demented attempt to connect with children that it's the equivalent of foie gras breakfast cereal or a bleu cheese milkshake.
0,"Good intentions, a full complement of parts, and proper assembly do not guarantee a successful result."
0,"Directed by Luc Besson, this inventive family movie sets up the most delightful premise, then squanders it on the kind of yawn-inducing CG adventure you might expect from one of those long, plot-heavy cut scenes that slow down video games."
0,"Arthur and the Invisibles may be a tale for children, but it's got the bad habits of a profligate adult -- the thing borrows shamelessly from its betters and then pretends to be self-sustaining."
0,"An odd imp of a movie, Arthur and the Invisibles may actually be filled with a bit too much invention for the average kid."
0,"Too eccentric for kids, too silly for everyone else, it floats in a Neverland of breathtaking visuals in service of a story that pilfers everything (and I mean everything) from the Arthur legends to last summer's The Ant Bully."
0,"There are too many things out of whack here, and too many unanswered questions."
0,"The movie bing-bing-bings all over the place, repurposing fantasy novels, video games, Arthurian legends. Besson's grocery bill for all I know. Even the musical score has multiple-personality disorder."
0,"Luc Besson has made a fair share of artfully bad movies. Arthur and the Invisibles -- half-live-action, half-CG kid's adventure -- is (by a hair) more bad-bad, like The Fifth Element, than good-bad, like The Big Blue."
0,"Luc Besson's half-baked live-action/animated fantasy looks like it was invented on the hoof: it's erratically plotted, poorly animated, overly derivative and too insufferably cute to interest anyone above undemanding toddler age."
0,Besson's labour of love is a feast for the eyes but leaves the imagination distinctly undernourished.
0,"A lazy fairy-tale pastiche reveling in mite-size cherubs, which cribs from gnomic mythology, elvish lore, Harry Potter, Arthurian legend and can't-pay-the-rent melodrama."
0,"Here is an overproduced, oversugared semi-animated children's fantasy adventure from Luc Besson that made me want to cringe into my +h seat, never to re-emerge."
0,Strange and kind of meandering.
0,Stevan Mena's debut film carves up body after body in a ritual homage to the serial-killer genre.
0,The acting and dialogue is as silly as the potato sack the killer wears on his head.
0,Diehard horror fans may want to weigh in. The rest can see it soon at the video store.
0,"If ever a movie deserved to go directly to DVD, it's this dreary horror treatment."
0,"Tame and cheesy even by the modest standards of the genre, Eternal needs all the intellectual trappings it can find."
0,"Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, Eternal is one of those movies normally found slinking around the ether of late-night cable television."
0,"Real scares are few, in part because the major characters are unsympathetic."
0,"Bram Stoker would be, well, horrified."
0,Quite silly and not especially scary.
0,"It's impossible to overstate the silliness of all this, but it would still be a decent Halloween trick -- if it were Halloween."
0,"Perfect for watching on video on a cool Cape Cod night, but maybe not so arousing in an arthouse for 10 bucks and change."
0,That the acting is stilted and that the filmmakers and especially Pla take themselves so seriously serves to make Eternal deliriously silly camp fare.
0,"I wouldn't recommend this for theatrical viewing, but as late night cable fare, it's an acceptable way for an insomniac to pass two hours."
0,"There's no camp in this vamp; the lady, and the film, is a tramp."
0,"The exaggerated production values overrun everything, including director Charles Vidor, who hardly seems to know which way to turn."
0,A padded Ben Hecht script and Selznick's invariable tendency to overkill are equally to blame.
0,"This film, for all its size and color, doesn't do much more by Hemingway's book than was done by the sentimental version of it played by Helen Hayes and Gary Cooper some twenty-five years ago."
0,Sweep and frankness alone don't make a great picture; and Farewell suffers from an overdose of both.
0,"What Hemingway wrote as an interlude of amorous flutes and distant drums, Producer David 0. Selznick has scored for brass."
0,"Perhaps what is most irritating about the film is that too many times an exciting scene of Hemingway's is shucked out in favor of a distressingly inferior one invented (if I may indulge the Muse a moment) by Ben Hecht, who is responsible for the script."
1,"A quirky yet commercial commingling of black comedy, seriocomic psychodrama, heart-tugging sudser and buddy-movie farce."
0,"There's a good movie in the general proximity of The Matador, but it only crosses paths with the one you're watching in a couple of scenes."
1,Just sit back and enjoy the fun.
1,"The movie has a nicely modulated mix of comedy and pathos, but succeeds as much because of the two lead performances as Richard Shepard's writing and directing."
1,"It's a savage, breezy, occasionally obscene and sometimes poignant mix of comedy and crime."
1,"The general details and color of The Matador fade quickly from memory while Brosnan's gamy, inscrutable libertine is still exhaling Scotch vapor in your face."
1,"Eventually, you forget Brosnan's ongoing effort to set fire to his trademark creased-and-polished image and begin to share his apparent glee in traipsing through this seriocomic farrago of crime melodrama, buddy movie and sob story."
1,"Now that hoopla surrounding the holiday blockbusters has peaked, audiences will have a better chance at not overlooking this poignant comic gem."
0,"Julian speaks for the film when he says, 'I'm a wreck, I'm a parody.'"
1,The Matador gets a 151-proof tequila shot of sharp comedy from the droll byplay between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear.
0,"Pierce Brosnan plays a gold-chain-wearing sleazeball in The Matador, a weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis."
1,"Stepping into the role was a bold step by the retiring James Bond, and Brosnan's smooth fit comes as both a shock and a pleasure."
0,The Matador teeters between comedy and moral inquiry but doesn't quite make it either way.
1,"The cinematography is consistently hipster handsome, the script is bracing in its lewdness, and Brosnan adds no unnecessary weight to Noble's meaninglessness."
0,Richard Shepard's noirish movie is constantly couched in quotation marks.
1,Funny and touching.
0,"The film rapidly devolves into a lame buddy picture, part thriller, mostly goof."
1,"Good comedy depends on surprise, and throughout The Matador I had no idea where the film was going."
1,"The Matador is admittedly a trifle in the long view of cinema, but it's an amusingly adroit piece of work nonetheless."
1,"The movie's writer-director, Richard Shepard, balances the macabre and the sentimental, and understands that although his film contains questions like 'don't successful people always live with blood on their hands?' its real subject is friendship."
0,"A colorful, freewheeling tale that never gets beneath its darkly comic surface."
1,Unevenly paced yet darkly funny and consistently intriguing.
0,"The Matador strives for an airy, merry amorality, but it never quite achieves liftoff, though at times it comes close."
1,"In The Matador, Pierce Brosnan plays another man with license to kill, yet he gives a performance wildly unlike his suave superspy. In fact, it may be his best role yet."
1,The chief joy in this film is the balance of vulnerability and conniving slickness that [Pierce] Brosnan brings to his hit man and the easy kick that a middle-class husband and wife get out of knowing him.
1,This comedy is as dark as it is oddly unpredictable -- and sporadically hilarious.
1,"This edgy little movie may not cut as sharply as a killer's knife, but it carves out a very diverting niche all the same."
1,"A tart comedy about economic duress and the mind-set of a soon-to-be downsized hit man, it's also a salty celebration of the romance and necessity of friendship."
1,"Writer-director Richard Shepard's movie is just a sweet, broadly made buddy picture that happens to look a lot like an Almodovar production."
1,"[A] really, really strong film."
0,"It's painful to watch as the movie basically destroys itself in the second half, slipping from its elegant thriller setup to tired sitcom shenanigans."
1,"The destination isn't much to get excited about, but you're in good company along the way."
1,"Let the good times roll, and take a run at The Matador."
0,"Never as good as you'd hoped or as bad as you'd feared, The Matador is one of those of up-and-down experiences."
1,"Weird, but watchable."
0,"... a dark comedy that is missing the laughs to be funny and the darkness to be, well, dark."
0,"Nice characters and situations: unfortunately, writer-director Richard Shephard didn't have much idea where to go with them."
0,"Brosnan's irreverent charm makes this a welcome alternative to Bond nonsense, even if it's insufficient to compensate for dreary Kinnear ..."
1,Hope Davis' brilliant turn as Kinnear's naive but slightly naughty wife... is the cherry on director Richard Shepard's sundae.
0,Well-meaning but dramatically lopsided tearjerker bogs down in generic teen angst and domestic squabbling.
0,"Smile is like a dose of cod liver oil: It may be good for you, but it's no fun."
0,"There's little doubt that a nonfiction film would have been more powerful than this strained drama, which offers a Malibu brat as the audience's point of identification."
0,"Overall, it's pretty elementary stuff, along the lines of a Disney Channel TV movie."
1,This movie's so filled with admirable intentions that they practically spill onto the screen before it starts.
1,"Sure, it's mushy, but you can't make a movie called Smile and not be at least a wee bit saccharine about your intentions."
1,"This mysterious object may be Denis's most gorgeous film (which is saying something), but more than that, it's a fearless filmmaker's boldest experiment yet, a direct line from her unconscious to yours."
1,"The Intruder ... is exhilarating and exhausting, the kind of picture you don't bounce back from immediately."
1,Claire Denis's magnificent enigma of a film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who travels halfway around the world to begin a new life.
1,[S]hould you see The Intruder? Yes -- but only if you're willing to ignore bothersome concerns about narrative and let the poetic images take over your mind.
1,"Characteristically impressionistic, French director Claire Denis' latest meditation is simultaneously baffling and beautiful, and definitely not for everyone."
1,Denis composes a majestic dream book of shots and sequences.
1,"Never has Denis demanded so much from audiences as with this shimmering enigma, at once intimate and epic, but it's worth the effort and then some."
1,"A beautiful, complex work that challenges viewers to mentally sift interior and exterior journeys."
1,"An interior epic with epic exteriors, a film with very little dialogue, where the pictures (photographed by the great Agn챔s Godard), actors and the juxtaposition of both tell the story."
1,"While it may take a few viewings to sort the details out, much about L'Intrus lingers, shimmering quietly in the memory."
1,"Thanks to the charm brought to the role of Ralph by young Adam Butcher, and strong performances from Campbell Scott, Gordon Pinsent, Jennifer Tilly and Shauna MacDonald, credibility is achieved."
0,Unrepentant hokum.
1,"A fine, small movie that deserves a long run."
0,"Ralph Walker is no Max Fischer, and his monomania gets dull fast."
0,"It's as if Max Fischer from Rushmore turned, mid-movie, into Billy Elliot."
1,"An amiable sentimental fantasy, joining running, religion and a boy with a whole lot of problems into an earnest production that entertains even as it milks some of its situations for all they're worth."
1,Touches the heart in unexpected ways.
0,"This crude, inspirational tear-jerker is as sweet as a bowl of instant oatmeal smothered in molasses."
1,"Written with the glee of a scheming Catholic schoolboy, but its geniality outstrips its plausibility."
1,A tart and tender comedy that pulls off a little miracle of its own by being genuinely heartwarming without leaving any cloyingly sticky emotional residue.
1,McGowan employs well-apportioned measures of droll humor and emotional urgency while spinning the story of Ralph Walker.
1,A charmer with heart.
1,[The] film never runs out of surprises.
1,It's worth seeking out this bittersweet comedy with its emotionally resonant story and stellar performances.
1,"Even when it's pushing the limits of shameless manipulation, this cheeky Canadian film has charm and wit."
0,You can't argue with the message. But its well-worn homilies might give you reason to question the messenger.
0,"It's hard to dislike schmaltz as mild as Saint Ralph, but let's try: The film is as bland as a communion wafer, sentimental as a Christmas homily, and predictable as the liturgy."
1,What began as a too familiar coming-of-age story set in an all-boys Catholic school steadily morphs into something arguably as familiar but more satisfying -- a triumphant sports tale.
0,Your interest is bound to fade long before Ralph does.
0,Writer-director Michael McGowan must be exhausted after all the tugging he does on our heartstrings in this sentimental drama.
1,Writer-director Michael McGowan proves there's a reason people keep making underdog sports movies.
0,"It succeeds in flashes, but the movie's mixture of humor and inspirational fluff never quite meshes."
0,"As predictably uplifting movies go, Saint Ralph isn't completely charmless."
1,"Funny, touching and uplifting."
1,Canadian writer-director Michael McGowan has packed it so full of earnestness that viewers end up jogging along.

1,The Baxter nods to better-behaved comedies of the past.
0,"Sex doesn't figure into The Baxter, Showalter's strained romantic comedy; exaggerated arrested development does, of a guy kind that congratulates adult men on their dweebishness, assuming that dweebishness is of the hipster Brooklyn variety."
0,"Showalter pushes too far: Nerdiness, after all, can be only so attractive."
0,"A Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet."
0,Savvy viewers will see through this pastiche of shopworn goods.
0,The Baxter is more than a little out of step in a summer peppered with crude or idiosyncratic wallflower romantics.
0,"If [Showalter's] acting is misjudged, his direction is merely uninspired."
0,The only way to even guess that humor is being attempted here is to monitor the comical faces mustered by the actors.
0,There are enough laughs in it if you're willing to settle.
0,"Provides a few laughs, but only a few."
0,"A tender love story and a dead-on lampoon of the genre, but its main drawback is that Showalter is egregiously miscast in the title role."
0,"The more the film stresses and strains to be funny, the unfunnier it gets."
0,"Michael Showalter is a funny man, but ... how to put this gently ... not a funny movie star."
0,"The problem with The Baxter is right there at the center of the movie, and maybe it is unavoidable: Showalter makes too good of a baxter. He deserves to be dumped."
1,"No great shakes, The Baxter nonetheless has a quiet loopiness going for it."
0,"While trying really hard to make Elliot a lovable loser, Showalter too often just renders him shrill and annoying."
0,Showalter all-too-slavishly follows the lock-step school of formula romance.
0,"Mildly cute while thoroughly forgettable, the chief achievement of The Baxter is it serves to remind viewers how thoroughly adorable Michelle Williams can be, even in something this inconsequential."
0,"The Baxter has many of the ingredients of a good-natured indie date movie. But when the lead performance isn't one of them, it gets difficult to recommend."
0,The Baxter is a self-conscious one-man show that obliterates the fine line between 'quirky' and 'annoying.'
1,There are enough laughs that those who enjoyed The 40-Year-Old Virgin might want to take The Baxter for a whirl.
1,
0,"Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny: Even in her slapstick there's pain. She's almost too good: It's not until she's left a scene that you realize the movie isn't working."
1,Showalter tackles his mission with energy and an upbeat attitude that makes him a winner as a lovable loser.
1,"The performers are fresh and offbeat, with the diminutive Peter Dinklage (Elf, The Station Agent) especially funny as a gay wedding planner named Benson Hedges."
0,The spark that an original point of view might bring to the oft-told tale is missing.
0,"Conventional, straightforward and very much within what used to be called the Traditional of Quality, this handsome film is a respectable literary adaptation but lacks dramatic urgency and intriguing undercurrents."
1,"The quality of mercy is strained, but by some strange feat it doesn't dissolve entirely."
1,"It's irresistible to read his sorrowful and seemingly classical take, from a filmmaker known as much for the schisms in his personal history as for the lurches in his work, as something much more personal and poignant."
1,That Polanski chose this as the movie he wanted to make for his own children feels motivated by more than a septuagenarian dad's desire to take a $60-million stab at a bedtime story. It feels inspired by a need to tell them who he is.
1,It still stings in unlikely places.
1,"With tact and enthusiasm, Roman Polanski grabs hold of a great book and rediscovers its true and enduring vitality."
1,A near-masterpiece.
1,This is that rare movie version of a great novel in which watching is reading.
0,"Polanski and his Pianist scribe Ronald Harwood have chosen to tell it in as simple a manner as possible, as though they had been given a Masterpiece Theatre assignment to dispatch."
0,"Polanski's adult fans deserve something more than a film for the kiddies, and Dickens deserves better treatment than merely 'tasteful.'"
0,Drab and unfeeling.
0,"Polanski's take will spark debate among Dickens lovers, but audiences won't respond as warmly as they have to Lean's classic."
0,"Polanski delivers an acceptable yet thoroughly uninspiring twist on the orphaned Oliver, who gets a raw deal every which way."
0,"A work of craft that could be flying the Masterpiece Theatre banner. You know, an earnestly worthy adaptation of a literary classic, as faithful and polished as it is ponderous and unprovocative."
0,"Dickens knew that melodrama answers to something permanent in our nature; without it, any version of Oliver Twist draws perilously close to the genteel."
0,"The first question I have is, why? Why would Roman Polanski, one of the most innovative directors of the last half-century, want to adapt a story that has been told again and again?"
1,"Perhaps it will take a school trip to encourage kids to see Oliver Twist, but that's one permission slip parents should sign."
1,"Seeing Polanski's version of this most Dickensian of all Charles Dickens' tales, I felt full and wanted no more versions (please, sir!), having now seen the definitive one."
0,The film is high on production values but short on heart.
0,Polanski's Oliver Twist is craftsmanly and relatively unsentimental.
1,Polanski's film is visually exact and detailed without being too picturesque.
0,When was the last time you walked out of a Polanski picture talking mostly about the sets and music?
0,"It's noble, high-minded and safe, and I can't help thinking that I would have preferred an audacious but honest failure."
0,"Great expectations are unavoidable when Roman Polanski takes on a Charles Dickens classic. Alas, his version of Oliver Twist fails to live up to them."
1,A grounded and unusually matter-of-fact adaptation.
1,"Poignant and primal, Roman Polanski's splendid adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic pricks the heart and the conscience."
0,"In Oliver Twist, it's the viewer who is punished."
1,"Oliver Twist is a lovely, tony picture, but it isn't exactly essential."
1,"Nitpickers may squawk over missing elements, but the film doggedly hits on the book's big themes: the power of innocence, the cruelty of class."
0,"Oliver Twist as presented by Roman Polanski is pretty much the same as Oliver Twist presented by anyone else, except perhaps it's a bit duller."
1,"As handsomely made, well-acted, dramatically unflinching and heartfelt as it is, Polanski's Oliver is a movie more admirable than emotionally affecting."
0,"Polanski's Oliver proves surprisingly uninspired, taking nearly the entire movie before it belatedly springs to life."
0,"Polanski could have made Oliver as haunting as his 2002 Academy Award-winning film, The Pianist. Yet his new effort falls just short."
1,"The film is worth seeing, but it won't hold a cherished place in your moviegoing memories."
0,It's as though Polanski had set the story's foolproof motor on cruise control and left the room; the tale is well told but told without personality.
0,"Technically sound and surprisingly faithful to its source material, Roman Polanski's version of Oliver Twist comes across as uninspired and flat."
1,It retains the book's emotional punch and darker elements - the spectre of the gallows is a running motif - and presents them in a way likely to engage younger viewers without patronising them.
0,"Please sir, can we have some less?"
0,"As his own producer and director, Mr. Wayne has unfortunately let his desire to make a ""big"" picture burden him with dialogue. His action scenes are usually vivid, his talk scenes are long and usually dull."
0,"An elephantine, historically inaccurate, stridently patriotic tribute to the handful of Texans who faced assault by 7,000 Mexican baddies."
0,"In spite of the painstaking attempts to explore the characters of the picture's three principal heroes (Bowie, Crockett, Travis), there is an absence of emotional feeling, of a sense of participation."
0,Interminable.
0,"[It] would be a fascinating exercise -- both artistic and anthropological -- if one word of G were authentic, artful or even borderline believable."
0,The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is a fitting backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Great Gatsby.'
0,"The filmmakers are going for something operatic here with their mix of love and loss, rap and race. They miss. By a lot."
0,"The problem with G is not merely that the ending doesn't work and feels hopelessly contrived. It's also that the plot adds too many unnecessary characters and subplots, so that the main line gets misplaced."
1,"In nimbly sidestepping the burden of textual fidelity, director Christopher Scott Cherot's freeform Fitzgerald riff captures the novel's sense of unrequited yearning better than any of Hollywood's more slavishly faithful attempts."
1,An unpolished but entertaining tragedy filled with outstanding performances and memorable moments.
0,"You should never make a movie about boundless, conspicuous wealth on an indie budget."
0,"We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the sha-fizzle-dizzle."
0,"[A] poorly acted, directed and written (but slick-looking) vanity project."
0,"The women are shrewishly materialistic, the men are manipulative or violent and the Polo wardrobes look fabulous on everyone. It's an ugly affair overall, but at least you can say you've never seen such beautiful shirts."
0,"The book was about class and the American dream. The movie is too, though it's most interested in the soap opera machinations of the plot."
0,"Christopher Scott Cherot's drama is an honorable attempt laid low by a verbose script, cheap production values, and a general tendency toward soap opera."
0,"There is scarcely a minute's worth of believable human behavior on display in G, which builds to a climax as incoherent as it is ludicrous."
0,
1,"I still thought there were enough good performances, great visuals, and an interesting examination of a lifestyle in a way that we haven't seen a lot of times in movies for me to recommend it."
0,No green light but the one mistakenly given to start production.
0,"Another strikeout, further destroying F. Scott Fitzgerald's film batting average."
0,
1,A minor British classic and a valuable record of the hedonistic Swinging 60s.
1,"Of course he gets his comeuppance, in an ending that has all the moral weight and sincerity of a DeMille sex'n'sawdust spectacular. Good performances, though."
1,"Behind its alley-cat philosophy, there's some shrewd sense, some pointed barbs and a sharp moral."
1,Caine plays the sodding little spiv with a raucous charm that makes Alfie seem more interesting than he actually is.
1,"For all its implicit misogyny, the original 1966 film version of Bill Naughton's play remains durable because of Michael Caine's career-defining performance as the cockney ladies' man."
1,"An amusing, moving and meaningful picture. Although for much of the way it tinkles along with the innocent merriment of a carousel, it dips into reality for its climax, and makes a valid and indelible impression."
0,"This is the kind of movie where a madwoman's outburst leads her to throw a mug that just happens to be filled with gold sparkles -- which can then be photographed cascading down on all the adorable loonies, in slow-motion."
1,"Startlingly direct, if unavoidably preachy, The Second Chance takes aim at Christianity's racial divide and the corporatization of faith."
0,"Sure, there are lots of positive messages about following your calling and seeing how others live, but that message would better resonate with the audience if the story wasn't so bland."
0,"[The film is] designed to launch Christian pop singer Michael W. Smith as a movie brand name. It doesn't really succeed at that, but it does manage to send a positive message in a pretty polished movie, a message aimed at regular church-goers."
0,"[The film is] sabotaged by hackneyed dialogue, sluggish pacing and a listless performance by Smith, who only springs to life when he's singing."
1,"A movie-of-the-week treatment of race and class, the film credibly portrays the day-to-day workings of an urban ministry."
0,It's not the message that bothered me but the obvious way in which it's delivered.
1,Second Chance delivers its parable of spiritual growth with enough tender nuance that it doesn't merely preach to the choir.
0,"As divided as the two very different churches at its center, The Second Chance reps an uneasy marriage of spiritual conviction and dramatic expedience."
0,"A contrived, rather unpleasant English-lingo thriller set in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, Moonlight takes a precocious love story between a young rich girl and an Afghan boy to kinky limits where few auds will want to tread."
1,"Not only is the candid (but never prurient) treatment of early-teen sexuality and drug use too hot to handle, but the narrative blend of fairy-tale wonder and nightmare logic feels sui generis."
1,"In this English-language Dutch thriller, a 13-year-old girl and a young Afghan drug courier fall in love while fleeing his employers."
1,Moonlight is a disturbing and daring thriller with an exceptional performance by 13-year-old Laurien Van den Broeck.
0,"A wild dream that spins into a nightmare, Moonlight isn't quite as provocative as it aims to be."
0,"There's an air of prefab provocation about the whole thing, and viewers should know that the director has a penchant for squirm-inducing images, not all of them strictly necessary."
1,"When it comes to the logical marriage of action, adventure, and science fiction, few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens."
1,"The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have, and, for once, the ads don't lie."
1,"""Absolutely smashing!"""
1,Makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills.
1,"A flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."
1,Aliens ends up as a wild and woolly roller-coaster ride of a movie which should attract anxious crowds of thrill fans as it cuts a swath through theaters from here to Alpha Centauri.
1,"There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles."
1,One sequel that surpasses the original.
1,"The trouble Ripley has found this time is exponentially bigger and scarier than anything she encountered in Ridley Scott's memorably minimalist, eerily elegant 1979 film."
0,Count me out of the fan club for this one.
1,[Aliens] is a spectacular example of state-of-the-art science fiction simply because it never tries to be overtly spectacular.
1,"It's blaster action, not Gothic future-horror. Fortunately, director-screenwriter James Cameron has shaped his film around the defiant intelligence and sensual athleticism of Weaver, and that's where Aliens works best."
1,This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s.
1,"Action thrillers assail but rarely test us; this is the tautest, most provoking, and altogether most draining example ever made."
1,"Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast."
1,"Beyond dispute, however, is the film's timeless worth as a cathartic work, especially in terms of its accidentally commentary on the sexism of the corporate structure."
1,"Sigourney Weaver is merely terrific... When she straps on her armament to do battle with the aliens, she makes Sylvester Stallone look like a pipsqueak."
1,"[Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil."
1,"You can thank a capable cast led by the estimable Lucy Liu, and work by writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez that succeeds in making the formulaic seem fresh."
1,"[Bette Davis'] veteran actress Margo Channing in ""All About Eve"" (1950) was her greatest role."
1,Mankiewicz's 1950 gem is a wickedly cynical cocktail of laughter and deceit in which everyone has an angle to play.
1,"Is there anyone alive who hasn't seen All About Eve -- anyone who doesn't love movies, that is?"
1,"A motion picture that, because of its priceless dialogue and unforgettable lead performance, will never lose its luster."
1,"A fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire. The legitimate theatre had better look to its laurels."
1,Mankiewicz's flair for dialog is so perfected that all three actresses shoot fireworks whenever they open their mouths.
1,"The hoped-for tone of Restoration comedy never quite materializes, perhaps because Mankiewicz's cynicism is only skin-deep, but the film's tinny brilliance still pleases."
1,[Features] more quotable dialogue in one movie than most screenwriters manage in a lifetime.
1,"For old-school Hollywood movie-making at its most polished, literate and sophisticated there is really nothing to match it."
1,"Put simply, one of the greatest movies ever made."
1,"The peerless tale of two rival drama queens, playing as the central attraction in the BFI Southbank's Joseph L Mankiewicz season, and rightly so."
1,"Here is a real Christmas treat: a restored version of Joseph L Mankiewicz's jet-black 1950 comedy about Margo Channing, elegant leading lady of the theatre, superbly played by Bette Davis."
1,A total joy.
1,The Zanuck production investiture is +h in every department.
1,"It crackles with smart, smarting dialogue."
1,What makes the picture seem so good (what makes it eminently worth seeing) is the satirical touches in its detail and the performance of Bette Davis.
1,"Joseph Mankiewicz was Hollywood's midcentury master of comic drama, and All About Eve, from 1950, was one of his signal achievements."
1,"All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout."
1,"Joseph L Mankiewicz's film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as [Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd], but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood."
1,"It is similar to a good many films that have gone before it, but Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed the picture, has been so ingenious in his treatment of the subject that he has come up with a thoroughly entertaining movie."
1,"All About Eve ranks among the smartest comedy-dramas in many, many years."
1,"Never has a film, both in story and in technique, been brought more closely to the stage than All About Eve... Its appeal and its success depend almost entirely on gesture and conversation."
0,"In this distasteful film from Salvador Litvak, a Jewish family tries to race through a Seder, but drug use, possible incest and some jokes at the expense of the autistic slow them down."
1,"When Do We Eat? is as imperfect as the Stuckmans' Seder, yet it has some decent punchlines, a strong cast and a good heart."
0,"Cliches and loud stereotypes as fresh as year-old matzoh infest When Do We Eat?, a farce about a wildly dysfunctional Los Angeles family's disastrous Passover Seder."
0,"A self-consciously zany dysfunctional family comedy, When Do We Eat? strains so hard to be outrageous that it sacrifices characters for caricatures. They might have had something if they'd let everybody relax, be themselves and enjoy dinner."
0,Another entry in indiedom's contest to create the most dysfunctional family.
0,It borders on painful to see this cast go through the motions of this uninspired script.
0,Watching this movie is kind of like being sprayed with emotional vomit.
0,But even the film's seeming singularity proves deceptive once it becomes apparent that When Do We Eat? is less a Passover movie than a Thanksgiving or Christmas movie dolled up in Jewish drag.
0,"Even Jewish audiences will be hard-pressed to find something to enjoy in this highly stagy, claustrophobic depiction of a Seder populated by one wacky family that seems to include every stereotype in the book."
1,"Its strong cast is loud and lively, and the bickering banter has snap and drive."
1,A cute little Matzoh of a movie.
0,"Crass, chaotic comedy."
1,"The movie's most distinctive feature is its cast, which has the fake lived-in comfort of a TV clan."
0,"Oh, what a distasteful film."
1,... worth a look.
1,A haunting and disturbing film.
0,"This abrasive Passover comedy-drama is extremely difficult to sit through, and if its makers weren't all Jewish, it would be considered anti-Semitic."
0,Litvak's movie almost immediately barges across the line separating the comically absurd from the outright obnoxious.
0,"Manages to be broad, mawkish and mean-spirited all at once."
0,"[A] most unfabulous, unfunny, and unwatchable embarrassment."
0,The mostly unfunny -- and unfabulous -- trifle never rises above sitcom level.
1,"A frothy lark with a decided sense of the outrageous, sincere affection for its characters and their romantic plights."
0,"There's so much ill-conceived fluff floating about the 'elusive true love' themes that by the finish, Ethan Green hasn't as much substance as a good Looney Tunes."
0,"Not un-entertaining, but director George Bamer's debut feature may play better on video."
1,"Ethan Green may not exactly be fabulous, but it is pleasantly diverting."
0,"With words streaming out of their mouths instead of into bubbles, Ethan and his gang of past, present and future lovers sound laughingly unbelievable."
0,The film's tone veers from misjudged sincerity to shrill sketch comedy of the broadest stripe.
0,"In his directing debut, David Vernon, formerly a first assistant and second assistant director, opts for the look of a cable TV pilot."
0,This feels like a school play that someone has dragged to film school and turned into a final project.
0,Tiresome romantic comedy that reinforces every imaginable gay stereotype.
0,George Bamber's film is bouncy and agreeable but has a certain flatness to it; never making the case for its existence as a movie rather than a comic strip.
0,The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green can't be accused of false advertising. This adaptation of the underground comic strip is mostly unfabulous.
0,[Director Fisher] appears fixated on Los Angeles as a nihilistic phantasmagoria.
0,"At the end of the antiheroes' ropes, at the end of writer-director Chris Fisher's genre exercise, guns have been drawn, blood has been spilled, cops have been thwarted from going straight, and nothing has changed."
0,Cuba Gooding Jr. sheds the halo that has threated to strangle his career by playing a corrupt cop in a nasty little genre film set in Los Angeles.
1,"It makes Training Day seem like a film about good citizenship, but Dirty is also a luxury vehicle for two actors whose every appearance on screen is a boon."
0,This isn't a film made by someone who knows anything about cops. It's a film made by someone who's seen a lot of cop movies.
0,The machinations of the plot are so murky as to be not worth following.
0,The only suspense is how long it's going to take for this movie to finally drag to an end.
0,"As good as the leads and the supporting cast are, and as much action as gets packed into the film's relatively brief running time, none of it draws us in dramatically."
0,"We get it. All of you guys watched the Tarantino movies and you watched the Peckinpah movies. Enough, give us something original."
1,A no-nonsense dramatic response to the LAPD Rampart scandals of the '90s.
0,Dead on arrival.
0,What will terrify the audience very early on is the realization that there's better acting in the video game than on the big screen.
1,"Debuting director William Brent Bell, who wrote the script with producer Matthew Peterman, keeps the pace brisk and the pot bubbling."
0,An anemic attempt to update the horror genre's imperiled-teens-meet-bloodletting-uber-fiend substratum.
0,"It's unlikely that Stay Alive could ever have been a good movie in the traditional sense, but it might have been better if Bell and co-writer Matthew Peterman had done more to exploit their gaming premise."
0,Perhaps the worst horror film to not have Uwe Boll's name in the credits.
0,"The star of Stay Alive is a cutting-edge video game, but the film still has hackneyed horror at its heart."
0,A notion of an outline of a rough draft of a killer video-game flick.
0,"There's a fascinating and terrifying story to be told about Elizabeth Bathory, the dramatically depraved 17th century sadist known as the Blood Countess. This ain't it."
0,Here's a movie that tries to be a video game but is less entertaining than a vending machine.
0,"This is a cool/potentially creepy idea only if you're in high school and goofing around with your friends at the movie theater. For everyone else, this isn't just a preposterous premise for a horror movie, it's a source of unintentional hilarity."
0,"The hybrid of cyber antics and bayou creepiness doesn't quite jell, but it all ends bloodily, and in an efficient 85 minutes, too. I'm not complaining."
0,"Videogames are no longer brainless, so why are videogame movies so slow to evolve?"
0,"Teen fodder like this isn't known for sophistication or storytelling depth, but the filmmakers seem to take the film's video-game theme as permission to eschew even the horror genre's exceedingly lenient minimums for characterization."
1,"... while its narrative style -- elliptical, fragmented, even eccentric at times -- is ambitious and imaginative, it sometimes makes for a loss of clarity and momentum."
0,"Stuttering like a busted console, the film's lack of invention is only rivalled by a paucity of gore which will seem positively comical to gamers long since inured to cyberspace slaughter."
0,Never has a title been more horribly at odds with the way you're actually going to feel while watching the movie.
0,"There's a gothic backstory to all this, which makes no sense but looks pretty cool."
1,"All in all, an unusually amiable and well-made comedy..."
1,"Martin has become a superb physical comic, and Tomlin brings some unexpected warmth to a cruelly written part. A manic fuzziness takes over in the last reel and spoils some of the pleasure, but it's still a sympathetic effort."
1,"Mr. Martin's astonishing performance is the film's most conspicuous asset, but the entire cast is good."
1,"It scores a lot of points by speculating on the ways in which a man and a woman could learn to coexist in such close quarters. Against all the odds, a certain tenderness and sweetness develops by the end of the film."
1,"Martin is his usual combination of flat cynicism and crazed childishness, indulging in some inspired Jerry Lewis-like clowning with his arms and legs hopelessly out of synch."
1,"Martin vaults to the top of the class with his brazen, precise performance. This one goes in the time capsule."
1,"Patently ridiculous, but acceptable because of the charm of the characters."
1,"Once the body-snare joke is under way, however, invention tends to flag and much of the ensuing humour explores the realms of fairly obvious smut -- brightly enough managed, though, if yon have a weakness for that."
0,"At first the film is content to play the situation for raucous laughs, trading on the embarrassment of two sexes sharing the same body. But, once the parties start experiencing finer feelings, the film finally becomes too awkward for comfort."
0,Most of the film is about as funny as falling off a cliff while trying to solve a crossword puzzle.
0,"Despite some sketchy story elements, much of it is pretty intoxicating -- that is, until the unambiguous life lessons bring pic down to earth with an earnest splat."
1,An atmospheric ensemble piece boasting several richly portrayed characters.
0,The gossamer spell is undone when the script topples into melodrama and then a too-tidy resolution.
1,"The filmmakers were clearly not interested in the ending but in exploring the characters and the situation, and they do that with sophistication and genuine feeling, both for the people and the environment."
0,As swoony and verbose and serious as an adolescent's journal entry.
1,"As coffee drinkers know, not all beans are equal, but the meaning of inequality gets an entirely different spin in Marc and Nick Francis' handsome and astute doc, Black Gold."
0,Nowhere near as probing as it could or should be. Valuable points are blunted by too many talking heads.
1,"Black Gold, a compelling documentary about the international coffee industry, might discourage you from ever drinking a cup of joe again. At the very least, it'll make you think deeply about what's going into that cup."
1,"No mere Western-guilt-inducing harangue, this highly informative documentary by British brothers Marc and Nick Francis is a model of patient storytelling."
1,"A beautifully made, provocative and very righteous documentary."
1,The documentary Black Gold tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story.
1,Black Gold is more an Al Gore-style message of hope than a total downer.
1,A mesmerizing documentary illuminating the human element in one corner of modern global trade.
1,A dry but enlightening documentary.
0,Meskela's is a story worth tackling again -- but without the over-caffeinated approach.
0,"Compared to a documentary like Darwin's Nightmare, which found disturbing visual analogues for the moral rot of global trade, Black Gold makes most of its points in words, not pictures."
0,"Although some scenes register with strong impact, there also seems to be a lot of padding, and the overall narrative is ultimately too diffused and unfocused for the film to have the sociological impact it so obviously desires."
1,Guaranteed to make you think twice about what you're paying for what you're drinking.
1,"This is a documentary that gets a lot across while avoiding cliches and easy exploitation, even in famine-ravaged places where more horrific images must have abounded."
1,More dynamism and knowledge in the telling and fewer cheap shots at young Starbucks workers in Seattle wouldn't have gone amiss.

1,"Black Gold moves at an inexorable pace, painstakingly building a case until suddenly it looms very large and casts an even longer shadow."
1,"If that $2 cup of Starbucks didn't jolt you awake, this documentary by Marc and Nick Francis might do the trick."
1,"While the film is quick to posit fair trade as a solution, it fails to answer why, even with Meskela's admirable initiatives, his coffee farmers still struggle to buy shoes."
1,If you don't buy Fair Trade coffee after this you never will.
1,"True, fair trade coffee is not the newest story around, but Black Gold still makes for arresting viewing."
1,Mr. Rossen has assembled in this starkly unprettified film a piece of pictorial journalism that is remarkable for its brilliant parts.
1,"Not only has this movie stood the test of time, but its content is as uncomfortable and relevant today as it was the day the film premiered."
0,"Today, its realism seems bland, its moralizing forced."
1,A fine adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer novel.
1,"It is a film that vividly impresses, with dramatic sureness the chicanery of politics as have been practiced in the past and may crop up again."
1,A poisonous political process from our not-so-distant past dominates Robert Rossen's classic film about the rise of a Southern demagogue.
1,It is one of the most vital and honest films to come out of Hollywood in a long time.
1,"Strong stuff, aided by great photography."
1,"The cast Is tremendous, though only three or four carry the heavy end of the log. Broderick Crawford makes a very good job as Stark, whom he portrays as a likable U.S. reprobate, in whom there are still sparks of decency."
1,[An] unpretentious and absorbing video doc.

1,Street Fight sputters with anger and despair at the durability of dumb-cluck demagoguery in American politics.
1,A tough and brave little documentary about the brutal 2002 Newark mayoral election.
1,"James is his own worst enemy in the documentary, behaving in public as a near caricature of Boss Tweed. But he won and is now serving out his fifth term."
1,"The story that first-time feature filmmaker Curry tells is extremely compelling, but where he really scores is in addressing politics and race in a way that allows events to speak for themselves."
1,"In brief, Marshall Curry, the young director of Street Fight, has hit the documentary jackpot."
1,"If you didn't already realize that politics can be a dirty business, then Marshall Curry's Oscar-nominated documentary will set you straight."
1,[Marshall] Curry's picture is must-see fare for any and every observer of the curious world of American politics.
1,The documentary is simple and strong and small. Its grit lifts it above its mechanical shortcomings.
1,"It's utterly fascinating, and if you don't follow New Jersey politics, you will be kept in the dark about the outcome of this 2002 race almost to the end."
0,"The material is so slight it can hardly bear the weight of music, and it sinks altogether during a series of the most incompetent and clumsy dance numbers I've ever seen."
0,"The conjunction of truth and lies hardly seems accidental in a film that sets out to recall a kind of filmmaking now lost, but succeeds only in denting pleasant memories."
1,Funny and real.
1,Indie coming-of-age dramedy about a precocious Chinese-American youth whose family operates a sleazy roadside motel signals arrival of a singularly promising filmmaker.
1,"There's little originality in the joy rides, first kisses, and clashes with bullies, yet this 2005 debut feature by writer-director Michael Kang captures the small triumphs of a boy becoming a man."
1,"Michael Kang's small, perfectly observed portrait of a Chinese-American boy captures the glum desperation of inhabiting the biological limbo of early adolescence."
0,"The Motel, Michael Kang's modest Sundance applause reaper, doesn't deserve to be shotgunned for the sins of 30 other movies. But the underwhelming syncopation of make-nice clichs is too familiar."
1,"Michael Kang Kang makes an impressive feature directorial debut with The Motel. But the person to keep an eye on is Jeffrey Chyau, a student at the Bronx High School of Science, who is a delight in the lead role."
1,"Like the best independent films, The Motel realizes that life is made up of minor pleasures and tiny epiphanies, not sweeping character arcs or big dramatic moments"
1,"Unlike so many indie films, Michael Kang's gently empathetic debut embraces eccentricity without drowning in its own hip irony."
1,The film about of a teenage Chinese-American boy struggling with adolescent issues while working in his family's fleabag motel has the precise brevity of a well-crafted short story.
1,A well-worn coming-of-age tale enlivened by pungent detail and a sharp visual sense.
1,"There is honesty and integrity in the filmmaking and the performances, which make The Motel among the best character studies of the year."
1,"It's a modest triumph of unflattering realism, proving yet again that a camera, a few good actors, the right material and a sensitive director are all you need to illuminate any particular aspect of humanity."
1,Perhaps The Motel meanders a bit too much -- hard to do in a 76-minute film -- but it is an engaging little movie.
1,"The Motel gives the lie to all those mainstream teen sex comedies starring happy, horny gwailos ."
1,"Such a heady combination of greed, girls and goals, all set to a pulsating funk background, should provide even a hardened football refusenik with 90 minutes (+ stoppage time) of entertainment."
1,Full of drama and fascinating anecdotes.
1,"An entertaining documentary that won't change the world, but should leave you spellbound for 90 minutes."
1,This intermittently fascinating documentary chronicles the rise and fall of the Cosmos--which is also the rise and fall of U.S. soccer.
1,"...a stylish scramble of evocative footage, groovy music, and crazy-candid reminiscences from key players still proud to score."
1,"Told in a breezy, fast-cut style, and backed by a boisterous soundtrack that ranges from Puccini to James Brown, Lifetime focuses on the players -- on the field and off -- that made the Cosmos such a super, if short-lived, team."
1,"Giddy, gossipy and endearingly unslick, Once in a Lifetime chronicles the rise and fall of the most famous soccer team in the United States with slapdash glee."
1,"If nothing else, the energetic documentary Once In A Lifetime proves that an audience once existed for soccer in this country, and could be cultivated again."
1,The documentary offers enough color and depth to hold your interest and leave you keen to see the World Cup finals.
1,"No Hollywood scriptwriter would dare make up a tale as outrageously unlikely -- but, as it happens, true -- as the one so entertainingly told in the documentary Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos."
1,Once in a Lifetime performs a belated autopsy on the Cosmos and the North American Soccer League and basically concludes that they died of impatience.
1,Far more entertaining than it has a right to be.
1,Anyone who wants to relive this flamboyant but fleeting chapter in America's uneven soccer history should not miss this.
1,"You don't need to be a soccer fan to, like Cosmos fans, fall for this captivating tale, told in Rashomon-like style."
1,"Lively, free-wheeling amusement."
1,"An energetic and often enjoyable documentary, particularly for soccer fans."
1,Once in a Lifetime does a wonderful job of showing that this collection of foreigners playing a foreign sport forged one of the great American sports stories.
0,"The movie is only so-so, borrowing a little from the VH-1 school of popumentary but lacking the snazzy production values."
1,"Once in a Lifetime would have benefited greatly from historical and outside perspective, but the story on screen is such a kick that even monotone narrator Matt Dillon gets caught up in the excitement."
1,"Once in a Lifetime, which relies on interviews and archival footage, may not be a great documentary, but it certainly gets its points across."
0,... treats its audience like a bunch of attention deficit disorder cases.
1,... accomplishes the minor miracle of making you mourn a sports team you likely never knew existed in the first place.

1,Closely observed story of the mental and family pressures that can lead someone to accept an exorcism.
1,Sandra Hueller deservedly won an acting prize in Berlin (she could have taken home 'most conflicted character' as well).
1,This quietly unnerving psychological study from German director Hans-Christian Schmid wields its ambiguity about religion and science like a double-edged blade.
1,Like The Exorcism of Emily Rose ... Requiem is loosely based on the real-life story of a West German woman who died in 1976 after a series of failed exorcisms.
1,Just as haunting as a horror film and far more heartrending.
1,"Requiem isn't a horror movie so much as a thwarted coming-of-age story, like Carrie without the bloody reckoning."
1,"You won't find rotating heads and vomit in the exorcism movie Requiem. Instead, German director Hans-Christian Schmid relies on a frighteningly realistic performance by Sandra Huller as blue-eyed blonde Michaela."
1,[Sandra Hller's] intensity is so compelling you truly have no idea if those demons are real.
1,"Quietly devastating and unbearably moving, this is a soul-searching classic."
1,"In lesser hands, Requiem would seem merely bleak, but Schmid makes a rigorously urgent and compelling film out of Michaela's odyssey."
0,"The nonsensationalistic results are also somewhat ho-hum -- and oddly less convincing than Friedkin's lurid mess, let alone the elegant satanism sagas of Tourneur and Polanski."
1,"The confusion and panic and everyday interactions in Requiem feel honest and true-to-life, which has nothing to do with how factual it is, or isn't."
1,"Stage actress Sandra Huller delivers a stunning, understated performance..."
1,"The movie ends a little too abruptly, but it features a heartrending performance from Sandra Huller that brought her the best actress award at this year's Berlin Film Festival."
1,"A naturalistic and thrillingly powerful film, with a stand-out performance from Hller at its centre."
1,"Working from an economical and intelligent script by Bernd Lange , Schmid directs his first feature with the easy conviction that eluded the makers of the preposterous Emily Rose."
0,"Over-complicated script, which tries to mix science, ghost cliches and protags' personal problems in a single pot, starts OK but gradually runs out of steam after the first 40 minutes."
1,"The film relies heavily on dramatic music for its thrills and some of the effects are a bit cheesy, but it appears to be so well meant that these flaws are easily forgiven."
0,Enjoyably rude but uneven.
1,"A flotilla of L.A. residents gathers in an unlandscaped recreation area in Baldwin Hills to canoodle, attempt suicide, plot revenge and dig into one another's psyches in writer-director Kurt Voelker's high-spirited if slight comedy, Park."
0,"It's all harmlessly naughty at the outset, but when it comes to juggling all those characters and their intersecting scenarios, Voelker lacks the dexterity of, say, Robert Altman."
1,There are plenty of laughs in the outrageous predicaments and the actors are obviously having a ball.
0,"None of the characters seems particularly believable, except Lake's; she brings some feeling to a thin role. And the campy, ""outrageous"" comedy is pretty thin, too."
0,"Suicide, infidelity, spousal abuse and arrested development are the building blocks of Park a wearisome comedy."
1,"Sustains a disturbing, somnambulistic mood..."
1,A densely etched portrait of a young man's descent into insanity.
1,Worth seeing for the delightful banter between Feore and Bouchard.
1,"As with all buddy movies, Bon Cop Bad Cop succeeds on the strength of the leads' rapport."
0,"The political maneuverings are of some historical interest, but modern relevancy is hard to find."
1,A workmanlike costumer that distills Blighty's long battle for the abolition of slavery and the personalities behind landmark antislavery legislation into a tidy story of conscience and perseverance.
1,"Michael Apted's Amazing Grace, from a screenplay by Steven Knight, turns out to be blessed with inspirational nobility and comic eccentricity to bring it to emotional fruition."
1,"Michael Apted's Amazing Grace is a beautifully chiseled blunt instrument. No, it's not subtle, but how subtle was slavery?"
0,It leaves the blood unstirred.
0,Apted is without a doubt one of the foremost documentarians working today. His Up Series represents a cinematic hallmark. His feature credits are less certain.
1,Amazing Grace is a case of good works done well...[an] admirable historical drama.
1,"[Apted's] picture, openhearted and enthusiastic, is partly an ode to Wilberforce and partly a love letter to the simple act of taking action."
0,"Like Steven Spielberg's glossy Amistad before it, Amazing Grace shies away from the texture and complexity of color, scurrying instead for the safer platitudes of black and white -- good and evil."
1,Director Michael Apted and his team understand the challenges of this kind of story and have met them with intelligence and energy. [He] has managed to be true to the outsized emotions of the story without giving way to sentimentality.
0,"[Director Michael Apted] has an unfortunate penchant for bland stateliness, and never more so than in Amazing Grace."
1,"Amazing Grace arrives Hollywood-slick, a polished British period piece. It manipulates, but then again, so does the song that gives it its title. Movies, like hymns and history, should give us a good cry."
0,"As written by Steven Knight, it seems so taken with Wilberforce's moral magnificence, it forgets to involve the audience, too."
1,That rare bird: a tear-jerker about the House of Commons and the antislavery movement in England. Michael Apted's idolatrous portrait of abolitionist William Wilberforce is wall-to-wall with intriguing characters and deeply felt performances.
0,"The rhythms [director Michael Apted and editor Rick Shaine] establish are jumpy and unsteady, afraid of allowing a scene to breathe and flow naturally. If the script were more alive, these matters of visual technique would matter less. But not much less."
1,"If you seek a movie that is uplifting, enlightening and ennobling, then Grace is for you."
1,"Amazing Grace, a prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce, carries a strong whiff of piety. It isn't a bad smell; there are notes of roses and treacle in the mix, but also elements of sweat and pain."
1,"A detailed, affecting biography of one of the great souls who moved humanity forward."
1,"Amazing Grace isn't quite an accurate title for this entertaining history lesson, but no one will ever write a song titled 'Amazing 20-Year Period of Parliamentary Maneuvering to End Britain's Role in the Slave Trade.'"
1,"Michael Apted's compelling and highly informative Amazing Grace is an apt celebration of America's Black History Month, even though its story takes place in England."
0,Director Michael Apted tells the story with dry devotion to parliamentary procedurals and a worshipful approach to Wilberforce. But [actor] Gruffudd lacks the intensity and charisma to pull it off.
1,"Amazing Grace is the stuff of great lessons and inspiration and hope, and if it's all delivered with a bit too much moral push, well, moral push apparently was what William Wilberforce was all about. There's another word for such dweebs: Heroes."
1,"Director Michael Apted has turned out a movie that might be best described as faithful, both in its attention to accuracy and in its acknowledgement of the role faith played in righting one of the great social wrongs."
1,"In building his movie around a single issue, Apted succeeds in capturing a rough-and-tumble side to politics that never feels too far removed from our own day."
0,"I'm sure [director] Apted meant well, but Amazing Grace comes across as a surprisingly graceless biopic narrowed down to one white man's uncomfortable burden."
1,"The film is inspiring. When Wilberforce finally achieves victory, Lord Fox makes a speech, in which the opening words, sadly, still ring true today: 'When people think of great men, rarely do they think of peaceful men.'"
1,Screenwriter Steven Knight gracefully articulates the many domestic and international forces at work.
0,"It's a doughty movie, stuck halfway between Masterpiece Theatre and Classics Illustrated."
1,"As square as this movie is, it has been made with eloquence and jaunty high spirits, and it tells a good story that is virtually unknown here."
0,"It is to be hoped that Amazing Grace is not the only, or the last, cinematic celebration of 200th anniversary of abolition, for there are more stories to tell, more imaginatively."
0,So much to admire and so little to amaze.
1,"Accessibility is one of the movie's virtues: without dumbing down, it makes the workings of Parliament seem as gripping as a good suspense thriller."
1,"Grufudd is fine, passionate and single-minded, though overly Romantic, and quietly upstaged by the extraordinary Benedict Cumberbatch."
1,"Apted's unexpected crowd-pleaser is inspirational, but also surprisingly entertaining."
0,It's neither amazing nor graceful.
0,"A decent cast under Michael Apted's direction does its best, but it's dull, naive and dramatically inert."
1,"A good -- and important -- story, not always well told."
1,Eloquent direction lifts this beyond a genre whodunit.
1,"Stylish, sexy and deeply emotionally resonant."
0,"Given that underwhelming police thriller The Silence is technically a made-for-TV movie, it might not be counted against helmer Cate Shortland as yet another example of the dreaded disappointing sophomore follow-up."
1,"If it's scruff we're after, then production designer Melinda Doring obliges with compellingly old-fashioned interiors, occupied by gnarled narks and retirees."
1,"Sure, the bombast is extreme, and, yes, it spends more time on tall tales than impact reports, but this vigorous, energetic doc captures the allure of a business that has never thrived on subtlety."
1,"The story is fascinating, if a little overlong, and makes you want to see a high-profile, big-name Griselda Blanco movie happen, like, tomorrow."
1,"A rogues gallery of flamboyant gangsters paint an anecdote-rich portrait of the drug trade, while a steady stream of cops, coroners and crime reporters furnish social commentary."
1,"An exhaustive, exciting and ultimately exhausting history."
1,"Set during the cocaine wars of the late '70s and early '80s, this documentary is out to reveal how Miami vice really worked."
0,"Parts of Cocaine Cowboys manage the impossible -- making cocaine boring. But the film doesn't shy away from presenting horrific images: We see blood-streaked walls, bullet-perforated bodies and Katie Couric's haircut circa 1981."
1,"If The Godfather movies were based on real gangsters and some of them were still around to talk about the good old days, they might be as fascinating as the characters in Billy Corben's documentary about the cocaine import business in 1970s Miami."
1,"An exercise in blood-soaked nostalgia, a look back at an era (the late 1970s and early 1980s) when Miami was a bad and dangerous place to live."
1,"Cocaine Cowboys is kinetic and absorbing, the documentary equivalent of GoodFellas."
1,As sensational as Scarface and a lot livelier than that Miami Vice movie.
0,A hyperventilating account of the blood-drenched Miami drug culture in the 1970s and 80s.
0,The only thing more boring than listening to someone on drugs may be listening to someone brag about how many drugs he used to sell.
0,"While the filmmakers clearly got a contact high from hearing all these war stories, most civilians will find a little of this goes a long way."
1,"At half the length it would have been twice as good, but nevertheless it stokes a nostalgia some may have for a magic period in Miami history when it was ever so briefly the American Casablanca."
0,"After beginning at a healthy clip, the film becomes mired in endless remembrances of debaucheries past and Miami's descent into lawlessness."
1,"This is an ugly film, but with an undeniable allure."
1,Forget Scarface and Miami Vice. Cocaine Cowboys is the real deal -- a down-and-dirty look at the high living and illegal drugs that dominated south Florida in the 1980s.
0,This documentary on Miami's lethal '80s cocaine scene is cut fast.
0,"The Jan Hammer music on the soundtrack works overtime to assure us that Cocaine Cowboys is the real, nastier version of Miami Vice"
0,"It's the sort of glamour-meets-violence drugs-crime story on which lads' mags thrive: unqualified, over-reverent and hysterical."
0,"Grisly crime scene snaps accompany the story, which makes Miami Vice look like a tea party and Florida like hell on earth."
1,The haystacks of cash and coke are laughably insane - as is the head-count: thousands of people were gunned to death. This is the only state in the world where Scarface might raise a smile.
1,Too often the film crosses the line between recording his subjects' illegal activities and aggrandising them.
0,Ropey graphics and sub-Scarface synth music simply add to the feeling that you're getting a low budget experience.
1,A documentary examining the Miami drug wars of the early 1980s in exhaustive - and occasionally nauseating - detail.
1,"You may be able to work out where it's going, but it's an enjoyable ride nonetheless."
1,If only it had taken the characters' lead and strayed further from the beaten track...
1,Gone but not forgotten.
1,First-time director Ringan Ledwidge conjures up an effectively creepy mood to accompany three young backpackers on an ill-fated road trip across the Aussie desert.
0,[The] film is undeniably topical but the lack of emotional investment in its characters renders it more intelligent than engaging.
0,"Part war drama, part political thriller, part romance -- and wholly uninvolving."
0,... an inevitably dated contemplation of the complexities of the American occupation of Iraq ...
0,"The Situation is, to put it kindly, a spotty piece of work."
0,Awkward and half-digested.
1,"Philip Haas's deftly paced, well-written, and brilliantly infuriating Iraq War thriller is not only the strongest of recent geopolitical hotspot flicks but one that has been designed for maximal agitation."
0,"An overstuffed, unengaging drama."
1,"Haas here imagines Iraq as the sun-bleached setting for an especially bleak film noir, in which love is treacherous, good intentions lead you-know-where and the line between good and evil is always shifting."
1,Audiences expecting this film to wring any kind of order from the ongoing chaos may find that The Situation merely reflects this 'situation's' rat's-nest confusion and seeming hopelessness.
0,"The situation in The Situation is grimly photogenic, yet persistently opaque."
0,"The narrative has no direction. There is no central problem to be resolved, no goal to be reached."
1,A powerful story about a frustrated American journalist risking her life to develop sources among Iraqi citizens who themselves are risking their lives to talk to her.
0,"[The Situation] plays like one long monologue, spread between a dozen characters."
0,"Set in wartime Iraq, The Situation is exploitation cinema of the most narcoleptic kind."
0,"It fails to strike an emotional chord, however, with a meandering narrative and heroes who spout rhetoric like pundits."
0,"The Situation is promoting itself as the first American dramatic feature film to deal with the occupation of Iraq. While that may be true, it turns out not to matter that much."
0,"The film would have made a serviceable drama, perhaps, if [writer] Steavenson and [director] Haas weren't so inured to trite utterances."
1,The Situation does an admirable job of guiding us through an almost hopeless quagmire.
1,"A gripping briefing on the post-Saddam morass of Iraq. The tactical calculus used by sheiks, insurgents, CIA operatives, soldiers, and civilians is ugly, but it's not inscrutable."
0,"There are a half dozen people in colorful supporting roles all of whom have their own truths. And all of whom are far more interesting, as characters and actors, than [Connie Nielsen]."
1,"The Situation' is bound to stir up controversy because of the way Americans are portrayed, and anything that gets people talking and thinking is for the good. It brings the war home, where our soldiers should be."
0,"[Haas'] attempt to convey the tangled relations between sheikhs and insurgents, occupiers and civilians is undercut by Wendell Steavenson's mightily overwritten screenplay."
0,The concept is strong and expertly fleshed out; it's just a pity that Hollywood tropes are allowed to invade.
1,Beneath the melodrama is an insider's account of the seemingly inconsequential details often edited out of dispatches from the front.
1,"The essential message in this strongly felt film comes clear: 'It's Iraq.' It used to be bad, but now it's worse. And anyone in his right mind, including Iraqis, wants to get out."
0,"Snow Blind calls itself a documentary, but it never stops feeling like the in-house channel on a ski-lodge television."
0,"Though some of the action cinematography is stunning, and practicing snowboarders will love the sense of camaraderie established, it's not riveting entertainment for the rest of us."
0,"It's understandable that Scott wants to highlight snowboarding's diversity, but perhaps a winter-sports documentary shouldn't try to cover the waterfront."
0,"Christopher J. Scott's film chronicling the rise of one of the world's fastest-growing sport is best geared to fans, presenting those of us with merely a casual interest with far too much information and repetitive footage of snowboarders in action."

0,"Hopkins claims it's a comedy, and perhaps John Turturro's live-action cartoon of a mogul producer suggests so, but what does it all mean? That art can be just as shallow as Hollywood?"
0,"Either one of the most self-indulgent vanity projects in the history of the Hollywood star system, or a rare revealing look at a distinguished actor who usually keeps his real self out of the spotlight."
0,"Slipstream is bold, experimental, off-the-wall kicky and utterly exasperating."
0,"Say this much for Anthony Hopkins' project: If he's going to indulge himself as a writer-director-star, it's probably better that he goes completely off the wall."
0,"I'm glad that Hopkins has apparently been using the bland, middlebrow stage of his acting career to experiment with massive doses of psychotropic chemicals and open the doors of perception and all that. Next time, maybe he'll just write a manifesto."
0,Slipstream ultimately winds up an avant-garde film that just ain't all that avant.
0,"At 96 minutes, this vanity/insanity project runs a bit long; five minutes would have been plenty."
0,"Slipstream is an experiment in visual stream-of-consciousness, but stream-of-consciousness fares better as a literary form than a cinematic one."

1,No one is spared in this whip-smart comedy about the entertainment industry.
1,"A high-energy rags-to-riches satire about a deranged New York paparazzo and a wannabe thesp, Delirious is hilarious."
1,The movie is exhilarating in a way that only hard-won knowledge of the world can be.
1,"Tom DiCillo's Delirious is a mild Midnight Cowboy, a minor King of Comedy, and mainly a vehicle for Steve Buscemi as a lower Manhattan-based paparazzo."
1,"In the end, I don't know that Delirious has all that much to say about the fame game, but you'll laugh nonetheless."
1,"The prickly camaraderie between Buscemi and Pitt puts Delirious back on track, abetted by a hilarious turn by Gina Gershon."
1,"Despite some plot holes, Delirious hits the bull's-eye with razor-sharp performances and dialogue."
0,Tom DiCillo?셲 angry comedy Delirious subjects modern celebrity culture to a microscopic examination that shows the toxic virus of fame squirming under its lens.
1,It's an achingly funny film that is also a little sad around the edges.
0,"Too many different stories are vying for attention here, and none of them are very good."
1,"Delirious, is among DiCillo's best, and returns to the central theme of his career: the elusive and destructive nature of fame."
1,Buscemi makes this pathetic and potentially lethal shutterbug a figure of surprising humor and compassion.
1,"There are some hilarious scenes here, and some moments so sad they'll make you wince."
0,"It would be nice to see a sharp, funny, penetrating satire of the new, kicked-up culture of empty media fame, but Tom DiCillo's scattershot buddy movie Delirious isn't it."
0,"DiCillo gets at how celebrity culture can erode a person's dignity and self-worth, and Buscemi's performance strikes just the right note between unctuous bottom-feeder and loveable loser. It's unfortunate that the rest of the movie tends to get too glib."
1,"Delirious, by writer-director Tom DiCillo, has a special quality because it does not make paparazzi a target but a subject."
0,"...it depends so consistently on plot contrivances and other movies (The King of Comedy,Midnight Cowboy, even All About Eve) that it often comes across as wannabe muckraking."
1,"Someday, far in the future, a team of archeologists will dig up the black, wizened, still beating heart of New York City, and it will look exactly like Steve Buscemi."
1,"Tom DiCillo's Delirious, from his own screenplay, presents a paparazzo's worm's-eye view of the ridiculous world of celebrity culture."
1,"With Delirious, writer-director Tom DiCillo has crafted a wonderfully giddy meditation on the nature of fame, the people who sell it and those doing the buying, and their mutually parasitic dependence on each other."
1,"As always, Buscemi masters his portrayal of needy desperation, but he still makes Les admirable for his capacity to go with the flow."
1,"For all its time-worn situations and observations, Delirious has a truth or two to impart about our lust for celebrities."
1,DiCillo's themes are loyalty and friendship and betrayal and redemption.

1,Steve Buscemi's adaptation preserves the original's biting basic scenario while adding a few Americanizing tweaks to this tale.
0,"While it is never dull, and occasionally sparks, material fails to ignite."
0,The least concrete and most artificial of Buscemi's films. But that's as much because of the situation as Buscemi and David Schechter's slippery script.
0,"This veneer of pseudo-adult psychological realism doesn't stop the film from being trashy, awkward and implausible, something like a stage play that might have seemed challenging in 1976."
1,Any doubts as to whether Sienna Miller is a gifted actress should be laid to rest by Interview.
1,"Premise of the Dutch film's remake seems less believable here, but the acting is compelling and believable."
1,"The back-and-forth between the performers is tensely choreographed, and Buscemi does a good job opening up the action, which mostly takes place in a Manhattan loft."
1,"Buscemi's Interview moves forward in static bursts that are contained by the avid, yet unobtrusive direction and the intensity of the two principals."
1,"Interview doesn't say anything new regarding our obsession with celebrity or, to paraphrase Janet Malcolm, the moral indefensibility of journalism. But the way [Buscemi and Miller] psychologically thrust and parry more than carries the film."
1,"Interview is mannered, implausible, and stagy, but queasily compelling all the same."
0,"Pierre is such a weasel, Katya is such a narcissist and the outcome seems so pre-determined, it's hard to care whose belt gets the notch. The adroit performances of Buscemi and Miller almost make it matter."
0,"Director Steve Buscemi is not to be faulted for his filmmaking or acting skills, but as co-writer he could have done better than the false-sounding dialogue."
0,"Buscemi creates an intriguing, if contrived, drama about the battle of the sexes."
1,"Miller is so good -- dumb, smart, wounded, wounding, a lollipop of sweet poison that you'd buy every day until it killed you -- that you feel you not only understand her but all actresses."
1,"Buscemi can play a hangdog cynic better than anyone, and Miller seizes her opportunity to express every emotion an actress can be asked to express."
1,"Vaporous and chilled to freezing, Interview lacks a single honest moment, but it does have plenty of diverting ones."
1,"I've sat through so many claustrophobic examples of the genre I forgot how exhilarating, how pure a great one could be. Interview is a great one -- electric as theater and cinema."
1,"The results may not seem to be taking place on planet Earth among verifiable humans, but, taken in the spirit of gladiatorial battle, the film is often fascinating."
0,"The most impressive thing about Interview is how much shock it manages to muster over the walloping nonrevelation that, now more than ever, hype begets headlines. Next up: the rich are getting richer!"
1,"Despite the fact that both protagonists are equally appalling, the screenplay seems to have a soft spot for the woman. However, this doesn't take away from the fun of watching the two characters tear each other to pieces."
0,"Despite a few interesting twists and ambiguities, the main revelation -- that the reporter is an insufferable snob -- doesn't seem worth the 84 minutes devoted to spelling it out."
1,"Kind of fascinating, especially in the ways that Buscemi and Miller make their performances into commentaries on the types of characters they play. When actors are really turned loose to play actors, they can achieve merciless accuracy."
0,"Ultimately, pointless. One comes away from Interview exhausted."
0,"The end result of this showcase for Buscemi's writing, acting and directing chops is so uneven and mixed in small details and overall tone that it's anybody's guess if it's one for the Oscars or the Razzies next year."
1,"A bitter, darkly funny little slice of arsenic, with some of the most stinging dialogue since Closer."
1,Mr. Buscemi and Ms. Miller prove that they are fully up to the task of carrying a whole movie on their shoulders without any help from the other characters.
1,"Interview slyly keeps you watching, wondering who will emerge from this long night's journey."
1,An eminently watchable contest between two actors at the top of their games.
0,"I'll just say that Buscemi, who also directed and co-wrote, knows a lot about making movies but little about journalism."
0,Interview has its moments but they can't prevent it from feeling a little long winded and unsatisfying. The premise makes it sound more interesting than the in-theater experience delivers.
1,"Stick with it for Miller's gutsy tour de force and the kick of watching Buscemi, as actor and filmmaker, turn an experiment into a mesmerizing battle of wills."
0,Buscemi's film conveys the spirit of its source material but doesn't make a satisfying transmogrification out of its homage.
0,This movie keeps falling out of rhythm just when it should be picking up pace. It's a fitful piece of wrong beginnings and false ends.
0,"Interview feels more like a lab experiment/tribute than a committed, personal drama, leaving us with the sense that Buscemi wanted to feel more connected to this material than he actually did."
0,"A mixed bag of realism and arch, dramatic exaggeration."
1,"Ultimately, this two-hander feels limited in scale, but frisky and diverting while it's on."
1,"Interview is well-made but depends almost entirely on its acting. Neither of the two principals let it down, even when the screenplay isn't quite as sharp as it could have been."
0,"It pretends to be about the games of deceit that go on between men and women, but it's really just a squib on the culture of celebrity, and the cynical conclusion that's meant to pull us up short is feeble and silly beyond patience."
1,"The friskiness of this pas de deux is something, and the acting duet enough of a selling point."
0,"A talky, tricksy but never particularly convincing or involving drama."
0,"There can hardly be a bigger waste of time than this conceited and self-indulgent two-hander directed by Steve Buscemi, remade from a Theo Van Gogh film."
0,The constant see-sawing of emotion eventually becomes repetitive and wearisome.
1,"Essentially it's a game of verbal ping-pong and, even if cynicism wins the day too easily in the end, the interplay is lively and intriguing."
1,
0,"A large portion of the movie is given over to gymnastics competitions, which are not explained or photographed well enough to be very interesting."
0,This whole movie may have been concocted on a synthesizer.
0,"Cast and crew are guided by the director from manipulative cliche to manipulative cliche, as everyone tries his or her best to overlook the fact that Gaylord, despite his athletic prowess, has little or no show-business talent."
0,The characters are laughable; the gymnastics are unattractive. There is nothing to recommend this film.
0,"It's a pretty ridiculous story, and screenwriters Evan Archerd and Jeff Benjamin never figure out a way to generate any real suspense, drama or inspiration."
0,"Unfortunately, as far as acting exercises go, Gaylord couldn't score a 5."
1,"Uneven but often hilarious. Bad-taste quotient is cranked up here, ditto the overall conceptual giddiness."
1,"The product of restless comic imaginations that would rather bounce to the next idea than milk the previous one for every drop. Some viewers may be exhausted by the barrage, but few will complain of not getting their money's worth."
1,"The Ten, admittedly, is not Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue. [Director] Wain's pieces are just jumping-off points for screwball improv and inspired throwaways."
0,One problem: The movie's just not funny.
0,"The Ten's biggest letdown are the interstitial sequences featuring Paul Rudd, [who is] usually the best thing about some of the worst movies."
0,"Anytime you compile a series of vignettes and call it a feature film, you're going to have hits and misses. It's the nature of the structure."
0,"Despite many giddy moments, the conceit becomes gradually more exhausting, until somewhere around the seventh commandment you're ready to choose God's wrath over any more overproduced, A-list-acted throwaway TV sketches."
0,"Where Kieslowski's work always had a goal and a sense for how real people think, nothing about The Ten suggests that the filmmakers ever thought any further than the next meager, uncomfortable titter."
1,"Like the comic masterpieces of [Woody] Allen's '70s heyday, the first five short films represent a brilliant, laugh-out-loud combination of grad-school braininess and vaudeville goofiness, highbrow absurdity and lowbrow shtick."
0,You really have to be in the mood to get into The Ten's forced goofiness.
0,The Ten never breaks out of jejune noodling and into something truly provocative.
0,A lame and irritating comedy that is an endurance test to sit through.
1,"Not so much blasphemous as it is very silly, and it lives up to the one unbendable commandment of comedy: It's funny."
0,It's more a frivolous spoof than a pointed satire.
0,"Multi-segment movies tend to be notoriously uneven, and this definitely proves to be the case with The Ten."
0,"The Ten is so proud of its own wit and irreverence that when you fail to be equally impressed, you are likely to wonder if your own sense of humor is, in some way, deficient. Rest assured it is not."
1,Darkly satiric.
0,"A Decalogue for special-ed students, The Ten leans too often toward the bizarre and the bewildering."
0,"This is one of those films where the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety, and it misses more often than it hits. The jokes are transparent. It's not difficult to divine what's supposed to be funny."
1,"The actors are so good, and so funny."
1,The Ten is devious and inspired enough to juice you past any weak spots. Thou shalt be amused.
0,"By flaunting its own stupidity, The Ten practically dares you not to laugh at it, like a stand-up comic who sells an unfunny joke through the ferocity of his delivery."
0,Perhaps the Bible needs an 11th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bore. That might stem misfires such as The Ten.
0,"If there were Ten Commandments for filmmaking, one would certainly be: Thou shalt not pass off sketch comedy as a feature film, especially when charging $9 a ticket."
0,The Ten is nowhere near a 10. Let's call it a six.
0,"Thou shalt be funny. Thou, in this case, isn't."
0,"Those worried about incurring God's wrath by seeing The Ten, don't concern yourselves -- by watching the film, you've suffered enough."
1,...brings to mind the fondly remembered Kentucky Fried Movie/Amazon Women on the Moon anthos from the '70s and '80s.
0,"The movie demonstrates a smart movie geek's obsession with the rhythms and gory details of horror storytelling, undermined by a pompous insistence on spiritual lessons of the tritest kind."
0,"The movie seems more like a '50s science fiction film of extreme paranoia or an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" that even at a swiftly paced 90 minutes feels padded."
1,"Effective nonsense, chilling nonsense, occasionally wrenching nonsense."
0,"After the insufferably dense mermaid mythology of Lady in the Water, Shyamalan clearly wanted to keep things simple. He whizzed straight past simple to simplistic."
1,"The Happening is a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense and a solid lead performance from Mark Wahlberg."
0,"There are scattered moments of craft throughout, but the gulf between his lofty aspirations and feeble accomplishments has seldom been wider or more chuckle-inducing."
0,The Happening stutter-steps its way in this direction and that to a disappointing ending.
0,"As for The Happening, his throwback horror flick that plays like The Birds meets The Blob, it's beyond good and evil. It's dumbfounding."
0,The Happening wants to scare us without providing a cause -- a trick only Hitchcock has managed.
0,"Instead of shocks, we get moments of tension, suspense and violence between stretches of running scared. Nothing wrong with that, except that the stretches are awfully long in places. And in the end, it all comes to not much."
0,Feeble gust of an environmental horror story.
0,Woeful clunker of a paranoid thriller.
0,"A patchy, uninspired eco-thriller whose R rating (a first for Shyamalan) looks more like a B.O. hindrance than an artistic boon."
0,"Shyamalan tries to give the events a scientific underpinning. But his logic is spotty, so what are meant to be eerie moments are not convincing."
0,Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous. The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method.
0,"The whole solemn concoction is preposterous and not always in a fun way -- even at 99 minutes' running time, the movie provides plenty of opportunities for watch-consultation in the dark."
0,"The screenplay is a mess, filled with unfunny moments of intended humor and funny moments of unintended humor."
0,"It's an entertaining movie, which is half the game, but it's not scary, which it should be. Neither is it something to be taken seriously, though it's intended to be."
0,"Shyamalan's such an eager recycler, grinding out the same ideas and images again and again. The man who showed such promise less than a decade ago has been leaving a diminishing creative footprint ever since."
0,"We don't care. It doesn't matter if they live or die, if there's a happy ending, or some kind of twist. The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or -- best of all -- not to bother with."
0,"The plot is absurdly preachy and illogical, and the dialogue uneven, with stinging lines followed by stinkers."
0,"If Shyamalan's ever going to do something different then he should have made something manic, dark and twisted. But that's not Happening."
0,No one will watch any of Shyamalan's recent films twice. A movie that features Wahlberg suggesting everyone try to outrun the wind can barely be watched once.
0,"The final explanation, which comes as no surprise, is more preposterous than profound. If you want to see a scary movie about humans wreaking havoc on their planet, watch An Inconvenient Truth instead."
0,"Wahlberg turns in one of his worst performances ever, but then he's saddled with preposterous scenes (like one where he tries to placate a ficus) and such lame lines as ""Could this really be happening?"" Funny, I was wondering the same thing myself."
1,"A subtle, measured work, which means there will be many who find it dull and pointless."
0,No mere actor could possibly escape the toxic dialogue oozing from M. Night's pen -- that's merciless.
0,It's downright stupid.
0,The shock value wears off quickly and writer-director Shyamalan strands us in a boring cautionary tale with an infantile eco-message about humanity needing to live in harmony with nature -- or else.
0,"Mr. Shyamalan is plagued by a bad case of Robin Williams Syndrome, characterized by a desire to inspire and change the world through mediocre entertainment 창"" in this case, accompanied by ample and frequently creative bloodshed."
1,Shyamalan's approach is more effective than smash-and-grab plot-mongering. His use of the landscape is disturbingly effective. The performances by Wahlberg and Deschanel bring a quiet dignity to their characters.
0,It's also a bit sneaky of Shyamalan to set us up for a paranoid 9/11 thriller and then go all Greenpeace on us. He's trying to be socially conscious but he doesn't have the reformist's temperament. He has the temperament of a self-infatuated messiah.
0,You feel like you're not watching the end of the world but the end of a career.
0,Shyamalan wants the rustling of wind through greenery to evoke the same shudders in The Happening that the gathering of birds did in Hitchcock's The Birds
0,"If what audiences are looking for is a thrill ride, or even a pervasive eeriness, The Happening's just not happening."
1,"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters."
0,"Maybe Shyamalan has been plugged into those other worlds for too long. Judging from what is on offer here, he needs to become more acquainted with the emotional language of this one."
1,"It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip."
0,癤풞ll that's missing is the head alien of Plan 9 From Outer Space dropping by to lecture the populace for disrespecting nature: 'Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!'
0,"For a movie with the potential for so much global-warming electricity, it's disappointingly low on voltage."
0,"The Happening is an awful letdown, yet it leaves you with something new, as a gently waving tree -- that classical image of pastoral tranquillity -- mutates into a harbinger of doom."
0,"[A]n astonishment, so idiotic in conception and inept in execution that, after seeing it, one almost wonders whether it was real or imagined."
0,"At first, a great deal happens, then nothing much happens for quite some time, then something so underwhelming happens that one is left wondering, 'Did that really just happen?'"
1,"Speculative pic on how Gaul's answer to Shakespeare found inspiration in an involuntary gig giving a nobleman acting lessons is sumptuous, touching and often laugh-out-loud funny."
1,A very silly film.
1,"All in all, it's a breezy, jestful and enjoyable divertissement, in which Duris is given free rein to showcase his considerable versatility."
1,"It is all jolly, harmless and amusing - at least until we get back to the ""real"" France and the ornate wallpaper starts shimmering again."
1,"A bit curate's eggy, sometimes funny and always goodlooking, but neither a particularly good tribute to a great playwright nor a comedy with much weight behind it."
0,"It's impossible to avoid comparison with Shakespeare in Love, which similarly made out that many of the great man's plays were really disguised autobiography; but the earlier film had a lightness of touch and variety of tone missing from this one."
1,"Moliere is an exceptionally likeable period comedy, powered by impeccable performances from Luchini and the wonderful Laura Morante."
1,"This is no biopic, but pure fantasy, a sort of ""Moli챔re in Love"" infused with the bittersweet romantic spirit of the playwright's work."
0,"Romain Duris may be a superb actor, but a light comedian he ain't. You need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing."
1,"The film feels distinctly skinny, as if half the cast haven't arrived. The symmetry of the story is almost too perfect. Several leaps of faith are wildly silly."
1,"This is the sort of period movie -- that would leave a modern audience with faces of stone. Yet the film, directed by Laurent Tirard, has something. To be exact, it has Fabrice Luchini and Laura Morante..."
1,Laura Morante proves once again that she is one of the most intelligent and attractive actresses in the world.
0,"Festooned with oodles of museum-worthy 17th century sets and costumes, Moliere is the sort of slightly naughty but literate frolic that congratulates the audience for its good taste; in other words, it's a bit of a snooze."
1,A period piece enlivened with slapstick and mischievous wit.
0,This movie about the crucible of imagination has none of its own.
0,"Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known as Moli챔re, wrote more than 30 plays, every one of them a hundred times more witty and insightful than the movie Moli챔re."
1,"The actors elevate what might have been fluff into a genuinely moving tale, and the action is so much fun that it doesn't even matter if you've seen Moli챔re's plays before."
1,"A conventional biopic would probably elide most of this period, which was before the pioneering satirist scandalized the establishment with plays like Tartuffe, but the disarming farce Molire, to its great credit, isn't really a biopic."
1,"Moli챔re is a restful diversion, perhaps too restful, but still acceptable. And the actors go a long way toward bringing it off."
1,Director and co-writer Laurent Tirard's pleasant but tame approach to his birth-of-a-major-world-dramatist portrait has its virtues.
0,"Woefully miscast as the seminal 17th-century French farceur Moli챔re, the intense, black-maned young French movie star Romain Duris never seems more comfortable than the brief moments when he's rotting in a dank jail."
0,"In making a comedy about a writer famed for his perfectly tuned wit, the filmmakers have inspired other expectations. The result is as off-putting as biting into a confection in which the sugar has been replaced by salt."
0,Moliere hardly matches the clever mockery of its 17th century inspiration.
1,"Through homage to Moliere's works and by the film's own example, [director] Tirard reminds us that comedy can provoke both laughter and thought."
0,"As a piece of speculative biography, the movie is unpersuasive."
1,"Like the playwright's comedies, at its best Moliere shows the depths beneath the archetypes."
0,"Lost in the exercise is any insight into Moli챔re's writing or any relevance to today, making his achievements seem more frivolous -- and considerably less amusing -- than they actually were."
1,"An extravagant and thoroughly irresistible story of intrigue, romance, comedy and artistic inspiration."
0,"Director and cowriter Laurent Tirard are clearly under the sway of Shakespeare in Love, but the talented Duris is miscast as the wily Moliere, and Moliere has none of Shakespeare's giddy charm."

0,Country rapists have their way with Gillian Anderson and poke Danny Dyer's eye out. The duo want payback.
0,This nasty and nonsensical rape-revenge thriller is a feature-length exercise in wrongness.
1,Straightheads has the pornographic ingredients of a first-rate cult thriller.
1,It's clear from the start this isn't a revenge drama that's going to wimp out at the end.
0,Note to the writers: Just because a movie is a mystery doesn't mean everything in it has to be.
1,"Less accessible to general auds than The Sun, pic deserves major accolades from fests as well as discerning arthouses."
1,Stark but moving snapshot of men on the front line of a nation's nightmare.
1,"Sokurov applies a thoughtful, humanist spin to the Chechen war - or any war - in this quiet mediation."
1,"Spare yet tactile, a mysterious mixture of lightness and gravity."
1,"Alexandra is a much more modest undertaking, but is just as compelling. And Galina Vishnevskaya, an 81-year-old opera singer, is wonderful as Alexandra."
1,"Alexander Sokurov's Alexandra feels like a communiqu챕 from another time, another place, anywhere but here."
1,Aleksandr Sokurov's anti-war drama Alexandra opens with a curious image and spends 90 minutes squeezing it for all it's worth.
1,"In the hands of visionary filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, this simple material makes for a haunting drama about war, generational relationships and the human condition."
1,"Alexandra is a pleasure to watch, but it's also one of those lovely, unclassifiable movies that flourishes better with repeated or prolonged exposures."
1,"The sepia tones and the claustrophobic camerawork are instantly recognizable as Sokurov's work, and so is the emphasis on family intimacy."
1,"The film is built on a massive incongruity: Watching this octogenarian drag her little bent-up wheeled luggage cart, amid rolling tanks and military transport trucks, you're looking at two eternal verities%u2014war, and civilians caught up in its wake%u20"
1,"Remarkable, how little Sokurov tells us, while telling us so much."
1,Sokurov is able to say things about the terrible conflict without obvious polemic but to the maximum possible effect. That's largely why he is one of the most audacious and original directors in the world today.
0,"His sepia images of war's futility are beautiful, and Vishnevskaya's face is a compelling one, but they cannot compensate for the soporific anti-narrative."
1,"The eerie haze of the visuals, the half-babble of music and the toneless, teasing dialogue dance attendance on the strangest ghost of all: Galina Vishnevskaya."
1,"But Aleksandr Sokurov, with the mesmerising and subtly disorientating directorial style that he has mastered, makes it feel emotionally real and imaginatively true. A wonderful film."
1,A bone-weariness pervades every inch of the film; even the light is bleached dry of vitality.
1,"Apart from a thoroughly irritating background track of schmaltzy classical music, this is Sokurov at his shortest and most digestible."
1,"It's also quietly challenging, in its own way, not least in its portrait of old age, its trials, new freedoms and the privilege of changing one's mind before it becomes too late."
1,"At least one critic has called this Sokurov's most political film, but on its deepest level it considers not a particular war but the complex feelings between mothers and the young men they send out into the world to kill or be killed."

1,Morgan Neville's quick-paced documentary The Cool School recounts the rise and fall of Ferus Gallery and the mark it made on American art.
1,A lively film that doesn't linger too long on any one thought or with any one interviewee.
1,"What The Cool School does so well, through its color accents and black-and-white photography...is impart a sense of discovery."
1,"No one emerges very well defined from this historical shuffle, but those who know the artists' works, or names such as Hopps and Blum, but have never heard them speak, will find The Cool School absorbing and informative."
1,"All told, and well told, this is essential history."
1,"Documentarian Morgan Neville takes an appropriately lively, left-field approach to The Cool School's eye-opening history of the Beat-era Left Coast art scene -- a lesser-known chapter in the story of American modern art."
1,Diverting.
1,"The Cool School, a breezy, lively documentary about a thin slice of the Los Angeles fine art scene in the 1950s, is easy on the eyes, and the ears too."
1,Cool School is a must for anyone interested in 20th century American art.
0,The Cool School is a history of the LA art scene which will be most interesting for those who are involved in it.
1,Morgan Neville's 'The Cool School' is a slickly packaged document of the burgeoning modern art scene in LA during the late '50s and early '60s which sadly submerges its fascinating subject matter in technical clutter and contrived set-ups.

0,"A particularly nasty slice of medical-themed horror, Marc Scholermann's film is the sort of thriller in which the tenderest scene depicts an autopsy."
1,"Much like Crank, it's the guiltiest of guilty pleasures."
1,"Even squeamish viewers are apt to be captivated by the tight, credible scripting; these 20-somethings talk and behave like today's irony-clad young sophisticates. And whatever your opinion of the subject matter, you can't fault the filmmaking."
0,"Like its characters, the pic is too clever for its own good, allowing the meticulously researched scenario to be undone by implausible behavior and gaping plot holes."
1,"Gleefully brimming with body parts and bad behavior, Pathology is a fun piece of flamboyant tastelessness."

0,A Christmas Carol is a whiz-bang 3-D thrill-ride with all the emotional satisfaction squeezed out of it.
0,"A Christmas Carol is, in its essence, a product reel, a showy, exuberant demonstration of the glories of motion capture, computer animation and 3D technology. On that level, it's a wow. On any emotional level, it's as cold as Marley's Ghost."
0,"Shortchanging traditional animation by literalizing it while robbing actors of their full range of facial expressiveness, the performance-capture technique favored by director Robert Zemeckis looks more than ever like the emperor's new clothes."
1,"Disney's A Christmas Carol is a marvelous and touching yuletide toy of a movie, and the miracle is that it goes right back to the gilded Victorian spirit of those black-and-white films of yore."
1,"Even as [Zemeckis] uses the 3D process to turn A Christmas Carol into a rollercoaster ride through a solidly built fantasy world, he never forgets that at bottom the tale is an awful warning about how egoism and greed can destroy your humanity."
1,"Just when you give up on it, usually in the middle of its latest, extraneous, gyroscoping thrill-ride sequence, Zemeckis reminds you that he's capable of true visual dynamism, enhanced but not wholly dictated by the digital landscape he so clearly adores."
0,Have we learned nothing from The Klumps?
0,"To put it bluntly, if Scroogely, Disney's 3-D animated version of A Christmas Carol is a calamity."
0,"By the time A Christmas Carol finishes piling its many shiny presents with their many bells and whistles under the tree, there's no room left for tears for Tiny Tim. Bah humbug indeed."
1,"Zemeckis' movie may lack the emotional impact of the 1951 British version of A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim as a truly transformed and happy Scrooge. Nevertheless, it's a visual treat that respects and artfully enhances its source."
0,A re-telling should either present a resonant or fresh thematic take. This Christmas Carol seems like a pale ghost of Dickens' magical Christmas classic.
0,"Carrey's performance as the miserly misanthrope is lost amid effects more typically encountered in theme-park and video-game adventures. (P.S.: Is it just me, or does it also peeve you that the Mouse House claims proprietary rights on Dickens' title?)"
1,"It's nice of Hollywood to go to all the trouble but, honestly, Dickens doesn't need the help."
1,"Charles Dickens wrote the book 50 years before movies even existed. He wrote for the imagination. And until now, movies haven't been able to measure up."
1,"Shockingly, the new film turns out to be very good, at times close to brilliant: a darkly detailed marvel of creative visualization that does well by Dickens and right by audiences -- when it's not trying to sell them a theme park ride."
0,"The holiday spirit feels real, but the film does not."
0,It's eerie rather than wondrous.
0,"Too much of the film is geared around 3-D wizardry. Unneeded sequences pop up for purely ""wow"" baiting."
1,"Robert Zemeckis finds eye-popping, high-tech new life in Dickens' hoary chestnut."
1,"The story that Dickens wrote in 1838 remains timeless, and if it's supercharged here with Scrooge swooping the London streets as freely as Superman, well, once you let ghosts into a movie, there's room for anything."
1,"By Fezziwig, that story still works and tugs at the heart. It would even if each ghost's visit weren't scored with overly-suitable Christmas carols."
1,How they made it into this Disney adaptation unprettified is a Christmas miracle in itself.
1,Zemeckis' film preserves much of Dickens' original dialogue and detail while amplifying the utter ethereal strangeness of the ghosts.
1,There's a lot of dark magic in this Dickensian Yuletide.
0,Want the creeps for Christmas? Then check out the latest version of A Christmas Carol.
1,Does this entertainment achieve a timelessness beyond its exquisite source material? Not even. Yet there's pleasure to be had and relief in feeling the filmmakers didn't Scrooge it up either.
1,"The movie may be yet another retelling of an iconic story, but visually it is often quite breathtaking."
0,"Zemeckis captures all the story's terror, but its pathos has always been the real challenge, and it mostly eludes him."
0,"You don't identify with Scrooge at any point, nor is blatant fakery scary. Picture The Seventh Seal with sock puppets."
1,A branded piece of shiny seasonal entertainment.
1,A splendidly mounted and visually imaginative animated 3D version of the classic novel.
1,"Cinematographer Robert Presley and the design team provide many instances of graphical triumph, influenced by silent cinema."
0,"A Christmas Carol should be as cosy and familiar as piping-hot tea and buttered, toasted crumpets, not a brain-battering sensory assault that feels like downing tequila shots on a rollercoaster."
0,"There is a weird lack of passion here, almost condescension, a sense that Scrooge's agonised moral journey into his past is potentially pretty dull, and so Zemeckis is always livening things up by whooshing the old miser excitingly through the night sky."
0,It's a heartwarmer that doesn't have much of a heart itself.
1,Disney's excessively hyped A Christmas Carol revels so richly in bringing the Dickensian details to sumptuous life that you wind up forgiving it for possessing a stop-motion soul.
0,It's like taking a Christmas wreath and dipping it in wax or laminating a Christmas card in plastic. Zemeckis risks creating another Yule ghoul: the Ghost of Christmas Without Soul.
1,"As the lead character, Carrey's CG-created body is spindly and bent, and he has fun with his vocal performance, turning every word into a strangled hiss."
1,"Dickens purists can stay away. Others can feel free to sample the rollicking aerial views of Victorian London, the droll and scary elasticity of Carrey."
1,Scores high on swooping visuals and meticulous draughtsmanship.
1,"A Christmas Carol is a worthy stab at mixing old and new, a vintage tale done with some fresh dazzle and a reminder that the movies can still bring the wow."
1,"At its best, this revamp gets the eerie oppressiveness of London fog and Marley's rattling chains just right -- we all know the moral, but Zemeckis does remind us what a spine-chilling yarn it is."
0,
0,"Zemeckis tries to juice things up by staging numerous chase scenes up and around London, but do we really need ""A Christmas Carol: The Action Picture""?"
1,"The motion capture animation is top-notch and it's hard not to be impressed with what Robert Zemeckis has wrought, even if there's the occasional sense he's pandering to an audience that can't get through a 90 minute story without a few yuks and a chase."
0,"What the film suffers from is a want of common comfort, despite its nominally redemptive, happy ending."
1,"While for some there is something disconcerting about the lifeless eyes of the otherwise life like characters, it certainly lends itself to large 3D cinemas, with rubber faced characters and grand sweeping movement."
1,[An] expertly assembled and engrossing documentary.
1,"Charting the thin line between courage and foolhardiness, it's a poignant portrayal of the excruciating emotional odyssey of all involved."
1,"Stories celebrating heroic journeys are commonplace, but this is a sobering, anti-heroic tale of an ordinary man who set out to attempt the extraordinary... and failed through a cruel combination of bad luck and bad judgement."
1,"The pic should suck even landlubbers into a whirlpool of gripping adventure, overblown ambitions and sheer human folly."
1,"Deep Water confirms all the mythical terrors that lurk in our dreams of the sea, and the best person to watch it with would be Melville."
1,"Given that the tedium of months on the open seas could and did drive a man insane, co-directors Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell have done a commendable job of making Deep Water... well, not boring."
1,"His story is a footnote in sailing history, to be sure, but a fascinating one."
1,"A spooky, moving doc that chronicles the first solo attempt to circle the world by boat."
1,"Deep Water is a documentary, but it's also one part adventure film, one part Greek tragedy, and one part meditation on the role of the 'hero' in modern society."
1,"An enthralling documentary about an Englishman named Donald Crowhurst who, in 1968, set off on a solitary, nonstop circumnavigation of the globe."
1,"A fascinating documentary about the first single-handed around-the-world sailing race, begins like a Boy's Own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy."
1,Remarkable.
1,One of this year's better studies of the human soul.
1,Osmond and Rothwell do a commendable job of mining a rich archive of material.
1,Osmond and Rothwell's depiction of his unraveling is an exquisitely structured drama.
0,To reveal Crowhurst's decision would be to spoil a stunning tale. Deep Water is not itself comparably stunning.
1,"Deep Water is a stunning documentary that not only beautifully elucidates a nearly forgotten incident but touches on crucial themes involving isolation, sanity, self-worth, impossible dreams, the nature of heroism and limits of human endurance."
1,"For this gripping and amazing documentary, such truth emerges not just from the facts, but also the poetry of men who redefine themselves in a risky race on small sailboats."
1,"Some beautiful shots give unexpected texture to the film, such as an underwater capture of a boat from below, with prisms of light surrounding it. And its final image is a quiet heartbreaker."
1,"As directed by Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell, the movie breezes along at a highly watchable clip, thanks to fluid, affecting intercutting of archival, black-and-white footage and present-day interviews."
1,The details just get stranger and stranger.

1,Actually better than its premise and its trailer might lead you to expect.
1,"The story's a bit dog-eared, but the voice cast adds plenty of energetic bite."
0,"You could say Beverly Hills Chihuahua is Lady and the Tramp meets Viva Zapata!, but seriously, I've seen zestier attitude in a Purina commercial."
0,"While CGI works its ventriloquism on the doggy mandibles, it neglects the human contingent, who are left to fend for themselves amid the manipulated menagerie."
1,"Sublimely silly and oddly poignant, Beverly Hills Chihuahua -- that's right, the one with the talking canines -- is Lady and the Tramp for lap dogs, Roots for pooches, Legally Blonde told from Bruiser's point of view."
0,"For kids who like dogs and grown-ups who don't mind a movie filled with pro-adopt-a-shelter-dog messages, it could theoretically be worse."
1,A surprise charmer that mixes family-friendly slapstick with shrewd adult humor.
0,"Like CNN, the film assumes it needs nothing more than our unlimited interest in the drama of a white female gone missing in a foreign country."
1,"Sure, it's essentially Legally Blonde told from a dog's perspective, down to Chloe's newfound self-awareness, but darned if it isn't awfully cute."
0,"For most of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, all I could think about was Drew Barrymore. What might she have been up to while she recited her lines for Chloe, the spoiled yet sad-looking live-action Chihuahua that speaks in her voice."
0,"The good news: Beverly Hills Chihuahua is not the apocalypse-signaling, cultural abomination its trailers make it out to be. The bad news: That's pretty much the best thing that can be said about it."
0,Beverly Hills Chihuahua is hardly Best in Show when it comes to Disney dog movies.
0,"Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast."
0,The film is Beverly Hills Chihuahua. The audience is the fire hydrant.
0,Beverly Hills Chihuahua approaches but never quite achieves a truly spectacular level of absurdity.
0,"If Chihuahua is no Babe or Charlotte's Web, at least it's in the Alvin and the Chipmunks ballpark. Just remember nobody went to the pet store and grabbed a chipmunk on the way home after that one."
1,"Depending on your tolerance for talking Chihuahuas, this live-action comic offering from Disney could make for a fun family night out."
1,Chihuahua turns out to be a pretty good family comedy that is more than the sum of its effects.
1,"Aside from some obvious racial stereotypes and voices that occasionally stray into Frito Bandito territory, Chihuahua has charm to spare for the adults, while offering plenty to keep young pups enthralled."
0,Ticket buyers older than 8 should simply close their eyes and ponder a more stimulating concept: Beverly Hills Cujo.
1,"As depressing as it is to find so many gifted artists reduced to making a talking-dog picture, Beverly Hills Chihuahua turns out to be genuinely sweet."
1,A welcome surprise.
0,"I spent a lot of time in the early scenes wondering how much Jamie Lee Curtis had to be paid to go on cooing in a demented way as Viv, Chloe's besotted owner."
0,"Beverly Hills Chihuahua isn't terrible. OK, it's kind of terrible, but it's a talking-dog movie, and anyone who goes to a talking-dog movie without being prepared to step in poop deserves to ruin his shoes."
0,It kind of reaffirmed a lot of cultural stereotypes.
1,It's cute and sweet and funny.
0,"In a triumph of animal wrangling and CGI tinkering, the canine cast turn in better performances than some of the humans."
0,This piece of egregious silliness from Disney - featuring live-action canines with CGI moving mouths - isn't quite as awful as it sounds.
0,"You want to cringe as the picture begins, but you end up quite enjoying it."
0,"Despite the mega-wattage of pic's starry cast, theatrical prospects seem dim for this clumsy melodrama, which looks and sounds no better than an average made-for-cabler."
0,"The movie is one long argument, tiresome and repetitive, that produces more heat than light."
0,"We're in the twilight land of the sensitive indie ensemble piece, something American stars gravitate to for reasons of range and prestige, but which ends up being more cathartic for them than for us."
0,"It's not a bad film - Lee directs with subtle grace and the cast is predictably strong - but it's saddled with too many characters, not enough drama and a strong sense of overfamiliarity."
0,"Julia Roberts, Willem Dafoe and Emily Watson are strictly slumming it in this saccharine melodrama."
0,A sickly sweet family drama stuffed with exceptionally high-profile performers - so much so that they threaten to overwhelm it just by their presence.
0,"A heavy, entertaining but slightly forgettable family drama."
1,"Consistently watchable and sometimes rather moving, although it is a rather slighter piece than the film-makers seem to think."
0,"An agonisingly sincere drama of familial dysfunction, this is notable for some very basic miscasting."
1,A watchable but ultimately blah family drama.
0,"It's a tragedy, in all of the wrong ways."
0,"Despite an A-list roster, the performances are universally one-note, a fact largely attributable to a script overflowing with blunt dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism."
1,"The relationships are lived-in and complex, with the same hopelessness that we find in real life. People don't change."
0,Lee doesn't trust his storytelling or the audience.
0,"""Fireflies"" is probably too convoluted to pave the way for more roles of this sort, but watching Reynolds get inside Michael's pain, you hope it won't be long until something will."
0,[A] middling effort about the fights and reconnections experienced by a family gathered due to an unexpected tragedy...
0,"A fraught family drama that shows us the same family in past and present, 22 years apart. It might have been more effective if it had followed a chronological order."
0,The emotional effectiveness varies from moment to moment between not pushing too hard or simply not pulling hard enough.
0,A dreadful exercise in navel-gazing that resides in a particularly trite corner of Pat Conroy-ville.
0,A dispiriting rehash of dysfunctional family clichs that seems to last longer than Thanksgiving Day dinner.
1,"The actors are all good and a few scenes -- an opening family argument, a crucial battle when Michael finally fights back -- are painfully moving."
0,"This histrionic family drama must have looked good on paper to attract such a big-name cast, but on the screen it comes off as glib, rushed, and underdeveloped."
0,
0,Seeing isn't believing.
1,An effective if redundant fright flick.
0,"When it comes to showing something to end the second-rate horror drought, The Eye is blind."
0,"The major problem is the death of a horror film: It's startling, but not particularly scary."
0,"The most frightening aspect of this supernatural horror film -- a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller -- is that there was a 114-minute version, before someone took pity and snipped it down to a lugubrious 97."
0,Yet another inferior remake of an Asian horror film.
0,"The movie is watchable -- never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top. But we've been here before, no?"
0,"The most vivid aspect of The Eye is its poster image, that of a huge female eye with a human hand gripping the lower lid from the inside. The least vivid aspect is the way Jessica Alba delivers a simple line of expository dialogue."
0,The Eye is the latest Western deconstruction of a successful Asian horror movie and it is louder and more literal than its inspiration.
0,"The script is credited to Sebastian Gutierrez, who penned Snakes On a Plane, a movie that knew how to have scares and sex and a bit of fun. What happened?"
0,"With every twist of the second-hand plot telegraphed far in advance, you don't need to be clairvoyant to see where this is going."
1,Effectively creepsome until it bogs down somewhat in plot explication.
0,One can't turn a blind eye to such conspicuous failings.
0,"Eventually the conventions of romantic comedy take hold, with the humor declining precipitously."
1,"Cook is most amusing while emphasizing his sardonic edginess, a trait that may eventually serve him well in some anti-heroic (or downright villainous) dramatic role. Better still, he establishes an effectively fluid give-and-take with Hudson."
0,"My Best Friend's Girl isn't just a misfire; it's a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations, and it's hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except, perhaps, Dane Cook's fan club)."
0,"The actors (especially Alec Baldwin, as Tank's horndog dad) elevate the material slightly, but such piffle will just fill you with longing... for a better movie."
0,"The movie spends a lot of time trying to be cute, vulgar and cutely vulgar. But it forgets about character, plot and believability."
0,Isolated bits don't add up to much here.
0,"In order for My Best Friend's Girl to work at all, it needs a leading man with the charisma to suggest the soulful, lovelorn gentleman behind the crude serial womanizer."
0,The inexplicable romantic comedy career of Dane Cook marches on.
1,"There are no surprises here, but speedy pacing and a smattering of laughs along the way, as well as a knowing turn by Alec Baldwin as Tank's even more piggish father, make My Best Friend's Girl a date not entirely to be skipped."
0,"Ultimately, its most unforgivable sin is that it's simply not funny."
0,"An ugly, strictly-for-meatheads comedy that can only be recommended to couples who wear matching Tie Domi Toronto Maple Leafs jerseys out on a date."
0,"It borrows from much funnier movies such as Hitch, Wedding Crashers and My Best Friend's Wedding. Never has a romantic comedy seemed less romantic or less comedic."
1,Cahan's curious and increasingly sincere slant on modern romance outshines its efforts to please Cook's MySpace fan base with gross-out gags (some of which are damned funny).
1,"Dane Cook proves why he is one of American comedy's favourite big-time naughty boys in this fast, funny, foul-tongued but sweet-natured adult-skewed romantic comedy."
0,"If you like watching anarchy in action, this exhibition has its moments, but the anti-woman humour underpinning it -- and Cook's whole performance -- does cast a pall."
0,"There's something genuinely transgressive beneath the movie's rom-com surface, though director Howard Deutch keeps retreating to the safety of frat-boy humor."
0,
0,"The pacing is too pokey by half, and the payoff is a wrenching disappointment."
1,"Before flying off the rails in the final curve, The Midnight Meat Train rolls quite smoothly as a mid-'80s-style psycho-killer thriller a la The Hitcher."
0,"We hate to side with the big bad studio, but The Midnight Meat Train -- despite a great title -- really does stink like month-old human flesh."
1,The film hurtles towards the final 'revelation moment' like runaway train. If only it had stopped to take on board some of Barker's heavy mythical dread.
0,"Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura, who kicked off his career with 2000's impressive micro-budget zombie flick Versus, delivers plenty of stylish visuals and an admirably unrestrained attitude to gore."
1,"this devilishly ambiguous thriller leaves viewers to decide whether to take the conventional or the less-traveled tunnel through its narrative network - and the results are a stylishly bloody descent into madness, murder and hell itself."
0,"It's hard to find the genuine heartfelt moments in The Lucky Ones, a story about three Iraq War soldiers on a brief road trip back in the U.S., under the clutter of narrative contrivances and coincidences."
0,"It isn't unpleasant to spend two hours with these three soldiers, although it might have been more enjoyable to spend the time getting to know them rather than force-feeding them artificial road bumps."
0,It's something of a well-intentioned mess.
1,"The Lucky Ones isn't dull, and the actors do quite nicely, especially McAdams, who's feisty, gorgeous, and as mercurial as a mood ring."
0,It's finally all too familiar.
1,"Even when it feels contrived, The Lucky Ones is enhanced by Mr. Pea, Ms. McAdams and especially the terrific, always surprising Mr. Robbins, in performances so likable and well timed they carry you aloft, like a flag."
1,"Director Neil Burger keeps things light, and the actors are more than engaging. ... But there's something centrally pat and predictable about the coincidence-laden story."
1,"If a couple of the plot devices seem contrived, The Lucky Ones makes up for them with sharp, heartfelt performances, and a deceptively easygoing narrative style."
1,A thoughtful study on the way foreign wars can reverberate here at home.
1,"This formula is fraught with pitfalls, but the characters and the actors redeem it with a surprising emotional impact."
0,"The plot functions in a rudimentary fashion setting up one contrived complication after another, engendering a desire, despite a few amusing scenes and pleasant company, for the trio to arrive at their respective destinations as soon as possible."
0,The Lucky Ones takes a decent premise -- three soldiers returning from Iraq facing domestic challenges upon their arrival home -- and crams so much forced drama into it that the movie devolves into a hack buddy picture.
0,"This is not the worst of the Iraq-themed movies of the past few years, and it's possibly the best acted of any of them. But you wish the bonding of these three people wasn't diluted by the trite scenarios and artificial circumstances of their saga."
0,"As they hit the road, the scenes play out like TV sitcom vignettes with little holding the centre together. We find out details about the characters lives, but never feel we know them."
1,"McAdams and Pea are affectingly vulnerable, while Robbins convinces as a family man with strong paternal instincts."
0,The Lucky Ones has plenty of heart and courage. If it only had a brain ...
1,"Like its lead characters, Lucky is wounded, lost, and impractical, but it has a messy, winning humanity and an agreeably leisurely pace that almost redeems it."
0,"It gets so preoccupied with all the local color and colorful locals, that it forgets about the people on this journey -- or their ultimate destination."
0,"Cheap, ignorant, tone-deaf and condescending."
0,Its lack of emotional thrust doesn't inspire the viewer to feel one way or another.
0,It's all merely unbelievable.
1,How unusual. How enjoyable.
0,"The chemistry between the three soldiers is strong, but their journey rings hollow."
1,"By structuring this as a comic road movie, writer-director Neil Burger manages to examine the emotional isolation of returning vets without sinking into a bog of despair."
0,[A] far-fetched take on Iraq War homecomings.
1,"With a smooth, light touch, The Lucky Ones focuses on the idea that the present and the people who factor into it are all we really have."
0,"The Iraq war has thus far produced no truly memorable dramatic movies, as opposed to documentaries, and the losing streak continues with The Lucky Ones."

0,Pegg exudes his usual air of faint self-congratulation playing an unlikeable prat whom nobody in their right mind would prefer to the high- flying Azariah or indeed to anyone.
1,Schwimmer often resists an easy laugh in favour of a poignant moment and thereby heightens the sense of urgency during Dennis' last dash for glory.
1,"What should be dreadfully synthetic actually plays as a pleasant time-passer, thanks to a goodly supply of one-liners, and Pegg and Newton's facility for investing a string of hokey plot devices with genuine warmth. Formulaic, yet disarmingly enjoyable."
0,"...excessive product-placement has turned the film into one enormous ad for Nike, with all the chilling humourlessness that this implies."
1,...despite lacking marquee stars could do well with the date-night mainstream.
0,"There are no surprises here -- just broad, frequently slapstick gags that don't avoid but do tamp down a bit on the bodily-function school of yokkery."
1,"Run, Fat Boy, Run stays out of sitcom quicksand long enough to make you think that Schwimmer has a knack for this comedy-directing thing."
0,"I wouldn't believe that Run Fat Boy Run was co-written by Simon Pegg if he weren't up there on the screen in teeny briefs and with his gut stuck out, trying to endear himself to the American audience in material maybe a notch above Rob Schneider's."
1,Pegg has staked out a peculiar slant on genre material that ventures beyond irony toward rehabilitation -- and nobody plays blithe humiliation with more style.
0,This is yet another parody that falls victim to the desire to become what it's intending to satirize.
0,"Director David Schwimmer bloats this slapdash concept into dim, witless overkill."
1,"It has meaning and sentiment and a nice pay-off for its finale. But without more laughs, Run Fatboy Run is awfully winded by the time it crosses the finish line."
1,"Clumsy and inept in demeanor but a whirlwind of comic energy, with an air of self-congratulatory winsomeness, Simon Pegg steals this otherwise minor but enjoyably unpretentious little comedy and pockets it like a Mars bar."
0,"Run Fatboy Run isn't particularly hilarious or moving, but it's got just enough humor and pathos to render its myriad flaws almost forgivable. Almost."
0,"Run Fat Boy Run is hard to love, thanks to the tedious romantic-comedy cliches to which it subjects its characters -- and us."
0,"The project represents an uncertain Britification of a script by Chicago native Michael Ian Black, and the result finds itself stranded somewhere out in the Atlantic, mid-crossing."
0,Snarkiness and sentiment are in constant battle for supremacy throughout Run Fat Boy Run with no chance of a comfortable draw.
0,"[Director] Schwimmer shows some skill by keeping the mood light and making no notable missteps, but he still comes away looking like someone trying, and failing, to play Judd Apatow, the reigning champion of realistic, emotional comedy."
1,"It may be the kind of film that will make you smile more than laugh, but you'll smile a lot. And although it practically forces you to root for its hero, you won't mind a bit because the hero is played by Simon Pegg."
0,"One thing Schwimmer does do right is keep the story moving swiftly. You're in, you're out, no harm done -- unless you want that hour and a half back."
1,"Amiable, consistently amusing and surprisingly affecting, it has the flavor of a Nick Hornby novel, with its focus on an overgrown boy struggling to grow up and be a man."
1,"Run, Fat Boy, Run is the directorial debut of actor David Schwimmer, who is much better behind the camera than in front of it. Here, he's taken material best suited to sketch comedy and turned it into a feature of no small heart and humour."
0,"Tere's nothing edgy or new about Run, Fat Boy, Run."
1,"This is a romantic comedy light on romance but heavy on comedy, and it's well cast to skew in that direction."
0,"Enough already. I mean, I don't have anything against comedies about dopey guys who win the love of a good woman by competing in ridiculous Olympian contests. But if I wanted to see a really funny one, I'd rent a Rocky movie."
1,"The kind of movie that's apt to be dismissed a goofy lark. It is that. But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running."
1,"Thanks to a jaunty Brit-rock score and likable characters all around, the movie's easy to watch and occasionally pumps up the emotions."
0,"There's much too much of everything in Run, Fatboy, Run. Every ounce of comedy is so forced and full-on ridiculous that when characters express even a smidgen of sentiment, it feels like a parody."
1,"This is not a film with blazingly original ideas or a groundbreaking script - I guessed the ending before the movie even started - but it has a sweet nature, an abundance of laughs and plenty of Pegg to spare."
0,"From storyline to characterization to style of comedy, everything about the directorial debut of former Friends star David Schwimmer is a nod to accommodation, compromise and consensus."
1,"There's a cheeky, cross-continental exuberance to Run, Fatboy, Run that lifts it over its predictability and keeps you laughing louder than you know you should. It's an upfront guilty pleasure without pretense; what a pleasant surprise."
1,"Run, Fatboy, Run isn't going to win any prizes for fresh questions. But it's just fleet enough to hold its own in the middle of the pack."
0,"Run Fat Boy Run might as well have been written by a rushed piece of software. The program calls for a surprise engagement, a street fight complete with crotch punches, an apartment eviction, and a runaway child -- all in about five minutes."
1,"Deserves credit for not working us over the way so many modern comedies too. It brings us to the finish line with energy to spare, instead of leaving us feeling sapped."
0,Schwimmer's sliced cheese mediocrity gets him off the hook; not so for the usually inventive Pegg and Black and their arms race of bland jokes and cheap male nudity
1,"Sure it's predictable. Sure it's a slight effort, but I still think it's pretty funny and charming."
0,This feeble premise limits the movie to perfunctory gags about the hero's sloth and some canned underdog drama.
0,
0,"The film jogs along uncertain whether it is aiming to be an episode of Friends or a Farrelly brothers farce. Overrun with fart jokes, it is fitfully funny and hamstrung by a sentimental and implausible plot."
1,"Amid the laughs, the one thing Closing Escrow proves is this: It's a lot more fun watching other people trying to buy or sell a house than going through it yourself, particularly if Realtors like the ones here are involved."
0,The film would have worked better if it had stuck more closely to real estate as both the source and target of the satire.
1,"If you can watch it without weeping over your own predicament, you'll see some serious talent bursting out."
1,"No matter how ridiculous the characters come off, they're more than just punch lines. In fact, despite their quirks, [they're] improbably endearing."
0,"A spoof, sometimes a funny one, and sometimes just plain overkill."
1,"A sometimes laugh-out-loud send-up of homebuyers' worst instincts, the extreme behavior of real-estate agents and what happens when the certifiably insane save enough for a down payment."
0,"The obviously improvised proceedings -- at least let's hope they're improvised -- fail to produce the desired laughs, with frequent pauses after punch lines that will only result in lengthy silences."
0,"Sadly, Whiteout wimps out, starting out like The Thing and winding up like CSI: South Pole, wasting whatever it has going for it."

0,"Whiteout is a conventionally jam-packed, dutifully ludicrous action thriller."

0,Stupefying journey to the bottom of the earth.
0,"For all its frozen blood, assaults with ice axes and killer weather, Whiteout turns out to be only a pale imitation of the thriller it might have been."
0,The severely nonthrilling thriller Whiteout moves like winter in Antarctica. Who the flake greenlit this blobby blur?
0,"While the setting can be mesmerizing, little else about this movie is captivating. It's a standard-issue thriller, with a twist you see coming a continent away."
0,"No event occurs without a character telling us what we're seeing. This unwelcome commentary is so overdone that it becomes, by the end, an invitation for audience participation. All together now: It's a body! Looks like it's been shot in the head!"
0,"The film is all panicky zooms and badly staged action dotted with random forensic gross-outs. And, just for the fun of it, an amputation scene."
0,"The movie then becomes one of those murder mysteries where everyone is a suspect, and the murderer himself is the least likely candidate of all. Dispelling all logic, you should be able to figure out this whodunit in the opening minutes."
0,A ham-handed murder mystery.
0,"Has a perfunctory, by-the-numbers approach to its story and its characters."
0,"...the whole cast delivers numb, almost affect-less performances; the cold must have got to them."
0,"Even in a whiteout, you can see the plot twists coming."
0,"John Frizzel's over-worked soundtrack keeps telling us how exciting everything is, but it feels as if we're frozen in time. Not so much a white-out as wipe-out."
0,"A whodunnit set on a scientific research base in Antarctica that slowly becomes a ""Who cares?"""
0,"Despite Beckinsale's impeccable features appearing to be rendered in porcelain, her performance is far from lifeless...she does the best with the material. It's just a shame the same can't be said for the film-makers."
0,"What's missing from Whiteout is the pervasive sense of paranoia that you'd expect, or hope for, from a thriller set on the coldest and most isolated land mass on the planet."
0,"Its worst offense is assuming the audience is so dumb that it'll be shocked by one of the most telegraphed endings in movie history. On second thought, maybe the filmmakers got their wish: Whiteout is shocking, shockingly bad."
0,"By eliminating so many suspects before the obligatory drawing-room denouement and final deadly confrontation, it's a given that the audience will feel cheated when the real bad guy turns out to be the only possible contender."
0,Should fade faster than a polar bear in a blizzard.
0,"Apart from a lascivious shot of his scantily clad star, director Dominic Sena keeps the action fairly swift under blizzard-like conditions: at times we seem to be watching people fight inside a snow globe."

1,"Filmmaker-actor Ray McKinnon voices his Southern droll in this amusing, feel-good comedy."
0,Black Irish boasts many memorable scenes and fine characterizations but ultimately plays more like a series of snapshots come to life than as an organically satisfying story.
1,A small-bore Southie coming-of-age drama whose heart is just a bit bigger than its cliches.
0,While the film has many well-observed moments...it ultimately suffers from its relentless piling on of crises.
0,"It may be manna for teen girls but any kind of critical eye will find it about as convincingly made as the last St Trinian's movie. It is played, though, with lively abandon."
0,"On balance, gouging one's eyeballs with a chopstick would be more fun than watching this crummy tween comedy about a Californian princess."
0,"The types are such extremes that the partisans in the audience will continue to hate American brats and English snobs respectively, rapprochement between two sets of caricatures seeming unlikely."
0,"A tweenie comedy with an uplifting American-style sports movie awkwardly bolted on, it's a mess - far inferior to the recent Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging."
0,"All amiable enough, but still a bit tame compared to, say, Clueless, or Lindsay Lohan's Freaky Friday remake."
0,It's Mean Girls meets Malory Towers and as such it's strictly for a tween girl audience.
0,This celebration of mid-Atlantic compromise is one for the youngest and most forgiving of teenage girls.
0,"The screenplay by Lucy Dahl (daughter of Roald) dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another."
1,Competent if mechanical helming debut by editor Nick Moore.
0,A movie full of egregiously overdramatic stupidities.

1,Aaron Woolf's we-are-what-we-eat documentary King Corn is a lively introduction to the corn industrial complex.

1,King Corn insists that we recognize the Corn Belt's beauty and intelligence along with its somewhat self-induced plight.
1,Deftly balances humor and insight.
1,"King Corn is entertaining enough, but it's also a moral, crucially skeptical road trip down the food chain."
1,"While there's no startling news here -- most people know that high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a staple in food processing and isn't particularly good for us -- this documentary neatly, and often humorously, summarizes a very unhealthy situation."
1,"A breezy diary from a pair of first-time farmers, as well as a wry rebuke to a nation devoted to eating cheaply but not necessarily well, King Corn makes its points without much finger-wagging."
1,"Simultaneously nostalgic and sinister, King Corn mixes full-blown Americana with fast-food follies in the Iowa heartland."

1,"Sure to inspire debate in France and Germany and of obvious interest to anyone who follows the roots of modern international terrorism, doc probes gray areas in the colorful life of its controversial, limelight-courting subject."
1,Engrossing.
1,The title Terror's Advocate is both a statement of fact and a worrisome understatement in a documentary as slippery as its subject.
1,"Jacques Vergs had defended a lot of people, and it's his Zelig-like journey through the politics of the postwar 20th century that is the contentious subject of Barbet Schroeder's unwieldy, unforgettable film."
1,That [director] Schroeder doesn't offer simple explanations gives his tale honesty and fascination.
0,Talk about a hard sell.
1,"Jacques Vergs is such a compelling, complex and contradictory character that if he didn't exist someone would be obliged to invent him. It is the gift of Terror's Advocate to simply present Vergs as is."
1,"Terror's Advocate is one of the most engaging, morally unsettling political thrillers in quite some time, with the extra advantage of being true."
1,"If nothing else, Terror's Advocate offers a useful summary of the last half-century of global politics, and how changing public perceptions can make goats out of heroes."
1,A brilliant study in the link between moral corruption and narcissism.
1,A panorama of European radicalism.
1,"Jacques Vergs makes for compelling documentary film fodder: He is arrogant, cosmopolitan, politically unpredictable and enmeshed in the roots of modern international terrorism."
1,"Schroeder's film, which combines interviews with many of the key figures in Vergs' career with grainy historical footage, lets its subject speak for itself but leaves little doubt of where the filmmaker stands."
1,"For just a moment, ignore politics. Consider Jacques Vergs simply as star. The radical French lawyer is an absolutely compelling figure onscreen: exotic, resolute, beguilingly smug."
1,The movie functions crackingly well as a non-fiction international thriller.
1,"The lawyer's intense isolation, his solitary, perverse rage against the world, against France, against conventional opinion, is felt most deeply."
1,
1,The story Schroeder unfolds is also his own-that of a generation that had its humanistic sympathies manipulated by unscrupulous people with agendas of horror.
1,Braun and his team manage to make this knotty situation lucid and palatable. Darfur Now could conceivably make a difference in enlisting people to the cause.
0,"While its activist subjects are indeed laudable, the film squanders much of its running time on ephemera."
0,"The argument can be made that the subject's urgency excuses the need for artfulness; the opposite, of course, is true."
1,"There are wounding tales of rape and murder, of parents watching their children massacred, in this clear-eyed documentary account of the genocide in Darfur."
1,"[Its] approach is effective at mobilizing audiences to support charitable causes, but it doesn't always translate into compelling viewing. (Feel free to stop reading this now and check out savedarfur.org, darfurgenocide.org, or helpdarfurnow.org)."
1,"Darfur Now is a worthy if inconsistent attempt at collaring a concerned audience and saying, You, too, can make a difference."
1,The best material is the result of the rare opportunity to shoot inside those refugee camps: hearing firsthand testimony from victims about the catastrophic horrors inflicted on their villages is forceful and persuasive.
1,"A quiet, methodical call to action."
0,The documentary Darfur Now proves that -- no matter how important the subject matter -- following various people around with a camera doesn't necessarily make a film.
1,"This is the kind of film that doesn't end after the credits roll, and it's a gold-star example for what a documentary should do: inspire."
1,"Provides context and an invaluable human face to a story that too many Westerners perceive as distant or irrelevant, if they perceive it at all. See Darfur Now, and you won't read the daily news the same way again."
1,"By showing the struggles and efforts of about half a dozen people, it puts a human face on the tragedy."
0,"In movie making, as in life, it's not enough to mean well. The real challenge is in being meaningful."
1,"Both important and engrossing, devastating yet inspiring."
1,"At 99 minutes, the documentary presents a quick but thorough lesson."
1,"It's a brutal mess, and Braun doesn't sugarcoat things."
0,A documentary exploring the roots and reason of African political corruptness and its history of a tribal violence that shows no signs of abating might have done more to raise real outrage.
1,"Nelson Mandela may not have defeated South African apartheid, but his story mobilized worldwide protest, which explains the focus on individuals in this effective advocacy film about the genocide in Darfur."
1,"If it accomplishes nothing else, Darfur Now locates Sudan on the map -- More than that, the film provides faces for the people of Darfur."
0,"Darfur Now is effective pamphleteering, but only an occasionally compelling documentary film."
1,All the stories are fascinating.
0,"A disquieting, and somewhat disjointed, call to arms."
1,"The depressing subtext is that even with detailed proof of ongoing genocide, it takes movie stars to get to the movers and shakers, and to get worthy movies like this one into theaters."
1,Informative and effortlessly gripping.
1,"Slick, impassioned, and guardedly upbeat."
1,"The title says Darfur Now -- not Darfur Then, not Darfur Sometime. But the question it asks emphatically is, Darfur Now What?"
1,"Thoughtful, sobering, hopeful, despairing, inspirational, depressing, and just in time for the holidays comes Darfur Now, a documentary about genocide in the Sudan."

1,"It's superior Bollywood soap, saved by the acting, which just about manages to raise it above sud-level."
0,This directorial debut by Clint's daughter gets stuck in a one-way dramatic track.
1,A capable but modest directorial debut by Alison Eastwood.
0,"The opening act is strong, but the story's trajectory is so obvious this often seems to be traveling along tracks as well -- into a valley of soap suds."
0,"It's becoming a bit tiresome watching Kevin Bacon suffer, and he isn't done any favors by this thudding weeper."
0,"Mr. Bacon, Ms. Gay Harden and Mr. Heizer are talented enough almost to bring off this fragile conceit -- almost, but not quite."
0,"As lovely as some of the footage looks and as committed as are the three lead performances, they serve only to make Rails & Ties play like an exceptionally well-acted and well-made Lifetime movie."
0,"There's a chance that a good film might have been salvaged from these questionable ingredients, but Eastwood opts for the tried-and-true approach of tearjerkers past."
0,Scripts [don't] come any sudsier than Micky Levy's awesomely bathetic Rails & Ties.
0,"While it features three strong performance and the debut of a promising filmmaker, the story line is obvious and rather melodramatic."
1,"[Director Alison] Eastwood has the advantage of two very fine actors, Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden, who have the ability to lift the most mediocre of material into another realm."
0,"A movie that should have had some more work done to it, and could have been better if it had, arrives with all its flaws carefully preserved."
0,"The only conceivable reason for Warner Bros. to (barely) release this mush is as a favor to Clint Eastwood, whose daughter Alison directed."
1,A modest but emotionally affecting drama.
1,"Fortunately for first-time director Alison Eastwood, Rails & Ties is populated by three sensitive actors who tread carefully through Micky Levy's anachronistic script."
0,Rails & Ties is so self-consciously unadorned that it feels as if its director didn't want us to think that she was trying to make a cinematic statement. She hasn't.
0,All the astute acting in the world can't bring such a preposterous story into the station on time and intact.
0,"One highly unlikely circumstance after another become laughable, preventing you from being moved by the family tragedies depicted. They beg for tears, but a script this chock-full of holes is unlikely to elicit the desired effect."
0,"I think somehow the filmmakers lost the way, lost sight of the people inside the plot."
0,There's just not much here to recommend at all.
0,"It's hard to get over the implausibility of the premise in Micky Levy's script, even though the characters themselves acknowledge that they're in a ridiculous situation."

1,"A fascinating first-person account of drug kingpin and ruthless gangster Nicky Barnes, whose outrageous story of rise, rule, rage, and revenge requires no such stylistic filler."
1,"Legendary '70s heroin kingpin Leroy ""Nicky"" Barnes is filmed like a deposed king in exile in Mr. Untouchable, Marc Levin's slick look at one of New York's most notorious criminal masterminds."
1,"It's fast and furious, and it proves that crime doesn't pay, unless you know how to do it right."
1,"Nonjudgmental without being morally dense, the film makes human sense out of an inhuman example of addiction capitalism, '70s style."
0,"Marc Levin, whose last documentary, Protocols of Zion, was a gutsy examination of post-9/11 anti-Semitism, has an even tougher job on his hands with Leroy 'Nicky' Barnes: making the man interesting."
1,What emerges is a portrait of a complex man.
1,"Sometimes persuasive and sometimes sadly comical, but always fascinating."
1,"It's not a pretty picture, but it sure is a compelling one."
1,Mr. Untouchable is never dull.
1,Less a dispassionate examination than a celebratory infomercial on its central character.
1,"[Director] Levin skillfully mixes the Barnes interviews with news clippings, 1970s street scenes and the recollections of Mr. Untouchable's former associates."
0,One seriously confused documentary.
1,"Does the movie glorify Barnes and his nefarious profession? Probably, but show me a movie about the drug trade that doesn't hook us first with guts and glamour before the moralizing fall."
0,

0,"The backstories keep piling up, with nods to The Shining, The Ring, and a dozen other gothic supernatural chillers, yet the result doesn't remotely scare you -- rather, it keeps explaining why you should be scared. That's why we're not."
1,An unusually sensitive take on schizophrenia.
1,"Auds will experience the joy of discovery in Greco's fact-based drama -- not just in its perspective on schizophrenia and the effect of the disease on one Florida family, but in Joe Pantoliano's cliche-demolishing performance."
1,"Greco's sincerity is so palpable that the frequent uplift feels deserved, but with just-passable filmmaking and the demeaning score, Canvas falls somewhere between powerful indie and made-for-TV diversion."
0,"Despite its admirable qualities, Canvas fizzles and falls into cliche."
1,I can see why it was a hit at film festivals. I only hope it now gets its due in theaters.
1,First-time filmmaker Joseph Greco draws on personal experience for this devastating yet honest portrait of an ordinary Florida family.
1,"Though Harden has the showier role, a subdued Pantoliano is the movie's real star. Sometimes, the quietest performances are the most powerful."
1,"Canvas is a serious film about mental illness and a sentimental heartwarmer, and succeeds in both ways."
1,"Canvas is a movie that rings emotionally true, despite structural contrivances and dim, washed-out color."
1,"Canvas is worth seeing for the acting, but the disease-of-the-week conventions and hackneyed visuals pretty well knock the wind out of its sails."
0,Canvas just doesn't sketch a sufficiently vivid portrait.
1,"Writer-director Joseph Greco makes a nice feature-film debut telling a true, disturbing story about a 10-year-old boy struggling to cope with a schizophrenic mother."
0,It's like a public service announcement with dialogue.
1,"Though Canvas may not deviate much from the formula followed by so many other movies about families imperiled by health crises, it's unusually perceptive about the ways that loved ones process (or fail to process) the resulting stress."

0,"When the most intriguing thing about a film is the production design, you know you're in trouble."
0,How can it be that a movie as beautiful to look at as Saawariya is so...boring?
1,"Of all the film's rococo pleasures-the lavish dance numbers, the dramatic rainstorms, and even the gold dust that puffs out when Sakina beats her rugs -- Mukherjee's richly textured diva is the most mesmerizing..."
0,"For audiences unaccustomed to the format, the film runs too long -- though it is short by Bollywood standards -- and is repetitive, sentimental and cliched."
1,"Saawariya is 2 hours 11 minutes of wide-screen close-ups, fanciful sets, colorful costumes, bellybuttons, almost-kisses and 10 pumped-up, achingly sweet songs."
0,"Saawariya entices, fitfully springs to life but finally outstays its welcome by a good half-hour."
0,See this movie if you need to get some sleep.
0,"Disappointingly, neither India's most artistic director nor his new discoveries can prevent this song-packed extravaganza from being a beautifully crafted bore."
0,
0,"Sony's first major delve into the lucrative global Bollywood market is an admirable, ambitious misfire."
1,"As an undemanding slice of masala entertainment, it's more than worthy of the Yash Raj quality stamp."
0,"For a film which invites us to 'come, let's dance', there is not a single number which encourages us to. Bring back the cheekiness of the choli!"
1,"Period detail is lovingly rendered (it's a nice touch to have people smoking in the cinema), while the technology is wonderfully '60s."
1,"It's good disposable entertainment that offers the right mix of character identification, plot unpredictability, and suspense to keep viewers interested throughout."
0,"It's left to Caine to wink and nod at his own contribution to real caper classics of the 1960s and '70s, produced with more emphasis on fun and less on instructive fact-finding."
0,Flawless is anything but.
0,"Michael Radford's leisurely paced Flawless digs itself into a deep, cavernous hole in its opening scene and never manages to crawl out of it."
1,Flawless makes an entertainingly nostalgic journey to old Britain -- that black-and-white world we remember from long-ago Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean movies.
1,"For all its stodginess, however, Flawless is a reasonably good time, for one reason. The reason's name is Maurice Micklewhite, better known as Michael Caine."
1,Those of us who'll happily watch Caine in pretty much anything will find enough pleasures here.
0,"This is supposed to be a caper movie. Shouldn't it have a heroine who looks as if she could, you know, conceivably, caper?"
0,The plot contortions that very slowly unfold under Michael Radford's arthritic direction in Flawless are not much...entertaining.
1,"There is a nice sense of style, and appreciation for tense face-to-face confrontations among characters trying to ignore the temptations around them. It's sort of the opposite of the current robbery flick The Bank Job - all substance and no flash."
1,"A nicely made if slightly stodgy jewel heist flick that offers Michael Caine one more juicy, low-key role and Demi Moore another step back up the ladder to career revival."
1,"Flawless is a gimcrack, a genre exercise, yet it's a confidence game in the best sense of the phrase. [Director] Radford knows the rules - when to bend them, when to break them, and when to play by them. That's an increasingly rare skill."
1,"Flawless, directed with a fine eye by Michael Radford, is a diamond-heist thriller that will make you nostalgic for the smart, classy caper films of a certain era."
1,"Flawless is a fictional tale, but something in director Michael Radford's conscientious, methodical presentation gives it the feeling of true history. Watching it is like watching a historical dramatization of something that never really happened."
1,"Flawless is a mildly diverting period heist movie in which an odd couple conspire to loot an evil London diamond company, for which they both work."
1,[It's got] some neat little twists and turns.
1,"The inspired pairing of Demi Moore and Michael Caine as a pair of thieves in the diamond-heist semi-caper movie Flawless goes a long way toward overcoming the film's slack, leisurely pacing."
0,Screenwriter Edward Anderson drops the South African angle in favor of more conventional developments and has a hard time bringing this across the finish line without a number of implausibilities.
1,"For about 100 of its 108 minutes, this film treats the viewer to a stylish, suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly, money-grubbing corporate types."
0,"The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare. Almost everything about the film is second-rate: the direction, the plotting, the intrusive modernist production design."
0,Fatuous and soulless.
0,"You will need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing, and, to be quite frank, the heist itself is not dramatised all that excitingly or clearly. But I quite like thrillers featuring enormous circular vault doors."
0,"Calling a diamond-heist movie Flawless is a valiant choice - especially when it's anything but. Suspense is essential to this genre, but here you couldn't care less what happens next."
0,"Demi Moore will do as the ghost of Hollywood past, rattling her jewelled accessories like a drag-queen Jacob Marley."
0,If only the plot was as sleek.
1,"Yet for all the imperfections, Flawless is a film you find yourself rooting for. Heists involving a keen sense of history are pleasant to stumble across."

1,"There are no big surprises, and only a handful of unexpected developments. But Kutcher and Diaz are undeniably appealing...nd the scene-stealing supporting players...go about their petty larceny with amusing adroitness."
1,Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz hate on each other with dynamite verve in What Happens in Vegas.
0,"Sadly, about the nicest thing I can say about What Happens in Vegas is that I didn't hate it -- although I suppose that's something."
0,"I didn't laugh much, and I never felt even an inkling of 'aw, cute!' romance -- but I didn't want to claw my eyes out, either. If that counts as a success, then I guess it's a hit."
1,"Not that What Happens in Vegas is any kind of great movie, but it's an exceedingly bright comedy that never makes you feel stupid for enjoying its brisk pacing, smart lines, sound construction and superb comic acting."
0,"What Happens in Vegas, one of those junky time-wasters that routinely pop up in movie theaters, won't make you laugh much or at all."
0,Complain all you want about the affable slobs in Judd Apatow comedies; at least they're not tools.
0,"So many things, small and large, erode any sense of fun here. The movie looks like crud -- like it, too, stayed up and drank all night."
0,"What Happens in Vegas . . . should have stayed in Vegas. Or in New York, where most of this predictable, uninspired film takes place. Or in Hollywood, where such lamebrained ideas are hatched."
0,Full-contact marital warfare connects with every body part save the funny bone.
1,What Happens in Vegas contains enough unbridled silliness to salvage its lowbrow high concept.
0,What Happens in Vegas... should have stayed in development -- forever. This ramshackle -- and occasionally repulsive -- farce doesn't even deliver on the minimal promise of its title; most of it takes place in Manhattan.
0,"What Happens in Vegas refuses to take a gamble. Like a bleary-eyed gambler repeatedly tossing a pair of dice, it tiredly goes through the motions."
1,"Here's a romantic comedy that is goofy, highly implausible, sometimes over the top, often in bad taste, and resolutely empty-headed. In short, it's the best example of its genre to appear on the screen this year."
0,"Why do we have to suffer through movies like What Happens in Vegas, which is the worst-in-breed not only for this year, but very likely in living memory."
0,"We all know what happens in Vegas -- and we know, without having to watch it, what happens in this movie."
0,"Considering that the title of the movie was conceived by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, it's not a huge surprise that What Happens in Vegas is stocked with product placement."
0,"You'd think the combination of Diaz, Kutcher and Vegas would be good for at least a little sexy, silly fun. But don't bet on it."
0,Screenwriter Dana Fox (the dreadful Wedding Date was hers) and director Tom Vaughan can't find much fun or romance in this. What Happens in Vegas ... offers none of the surprises that screen comedy so desperately needs.
0,"It's called What Happens in Vegas, but it should have been called What Happens in Hollywood as it pretty much defines contrived studio comedy."
0,"For an idea of the level of wit, several gags are built around the name 'Dick Banger'."
0,"While Diaz and Kutcher make their clich챕d characters as likable as possible, you can bet on this: Any movie named after an already-stale ad campaign isn't likely to gamble on the unexpected."
0,"The latest uptight chick/slacker dude romantic comedy is so formulaic, you could win big if you placed bets on what's going to happen next."
0,"What Happens in Vegas feels oddly stilted yet desperate, as though its principals felt the need to overcompensate for the too-neat symmetry of opening scenes with over-the-top violence and bright orange tans."
0,Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz almost pull off Vegas despite everything. And there's quite a bit of everything.
0,Who knew the title wasn't simply clever (inviting the rejoiner 'stays in Vegas') but a dire warning of a bad movie ahead?
0,"It was inevitable that an annoying catchphrase would one day become the title for an annoying movie. What Happens in Vegas is not only annoying, it's also incompetent -- a bad mix."
1,"Though likely not a film you'll remember a month after seeing it, it does hit most of the right notes for a good date flick."
1,The felicitous pairing of Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher overcomes the mechanical setup of this amiable screwball comedy about mismatched Manhattanites who wed in Las Vegas following a drunken first date.
0,When it was over I felt vaguely embarrassed. I wasn't just leaving a movie theater. I was taking a walk of shame.
0,"What happens in Vegas is exactly what you would expect: It's formulaic, slapsticky, silly and loud, until it goes all gooey in the end."
1,What Happens in Vegas . . . boasts the not inconsiderable appeal of good-looking people having a good time -- even while having a bad time.
0,"What Happens in Vegas should damn well have stayed in Vegas. Instead, the thing has leaked out as a movie that, one grey morning this week, swiped 100 minutes from my life."
0,"Amid the bright lights, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher fail to generate even the faintest of erotic sparks."
0,"The screenplay is awful, the direction is bland and the performances are beyond redemption."
1,The combined verve Diaz and Kutcher bring to the table saves a routine time-killer from being entirely forgettable.

1,"Appaloosa is a pleasingly spacious piece of work, but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological duel."
0,"Ed Harris reunites with Viggo Mortensen, his co-star in A History of Violence, and the chemistry is easygoing and understated. But he should have left the direction to someone else."
0,It's high time for the western to be resuscitated as a genre; a picture that just pokes along amiably isn't enough to get the job done.
1,Appaloosa is gripping entertainment that keeps springing surprises.
1,"In the early going, Appaloosa does an efficient job of establishing the tense standoff between lawmen-for-hire Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen, and a tyrannical rancher (an extravagantly sinister Jeremy Irons)."
1,Appaloosa satisfies all its requirements but never breaks a sweat.
0,"Mannered, episodic and slow."
1,It's a pleasure to watch such gifted actors interact in a classic genre.
1,Harris follows his strong helming debut Pollock with a contribution to the western movie revival that looks and sounds like a classic.
1,"Ed Harris has the kind of head that would look great on a coin, but it looks even better on a movie screen, as he turns his chiseled features this way and that."
1,"Beautifully photographed by Dean Semler, Appaloosa is the best Western since Open Range and shows there's still life in this most unfashionable of genres."
1,"Though the leads do fine work, their efforts often feel slightly futile."
0,"It's unfortunate for everyone concerned, and for the film, that the train chugs into town one day."
1,"Appaloosa shows a square jaw and a steely gaze, but also a smile and a wink."
0,"The top-heavy plot takes over, and the picture makes a beeline back to tepid convention."
1,"In all, Appaloosa is good as far as it goes -- everything in it feels true -- but I wish that Harris had pushed his ideas further."
1,"This, though, is not so much a comedy as a western with the ironic undertones that someone like Hawks would appreciate while telling a story such as Rio Bravo."
1,"A pity that Harris's homage to westerns should be compromised so intrusively. For most of its length, in terms of its themes, pacing and visual sweep, it's a treat."
1,"Photographed handsomely with wide-angled majesty, the film does precious little myth-making, though Harris subtly twists some of the genre's conventions."
1,"This is no revisionist western designed to shock life into an unfashionable genre, rather a film that respects the conventions of the traditional western."
1,"These are horse-opera fundamentals; having given them short shrift, the film just shuffles down its lonesome trail into the horizon and out of your memory."
1,"Ed Harris, working from a Robert Parker novel, has crafted a meticulously detailed, newfangled old-fashioned morality tale of hard men who go soft when a woman comes between them."
1,"Appaloosa is an archetypal western with touches of the modern buddy comedy. Though it falls short of these classics, it is a little bit Destry Rides Again and a little bit more Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
1,What is seductive about Appaloosa is its easygoing rhythm.
1,"Ambition is a great quality in a filmmaker, especially when it's realized. Yet there is something to be said for just telling a story, and with Appaloosa, Harris does a fine job of it."
1,
1,"Dialogue, much of it lifted straight from Parker's novel, proves mostly engaging."
1,"Harris displays a quiet, unshowy confidence and a genuine fondness for the genre, capturing the horses and guns and saloon glasses in a soft, almost-sundown light."
1,"Harris co-wrote, directed and stars in the film, which is filled with humor, action and clever turns."
1,"There's a refreshing vein of understated humor running throughout the production. It's neither forced nor unnatural and it keeps things from becoming too somber, even when the bullets start flying."
1,"From its first, mournful brass theme, Ed Harris's Appaloosa nails the look and feel of a classic Western. This is an old-style, laconically macho, six-shooting horse opera made with an obvious and unapologetic love of the genre."
0,"After Appaloosa establishes its slightly modern characters in a traditional setting, it has nowhere to go but toward the completely expected."
0,Harris directs with a steady hand and sharp eye for the best in his fellow actors.
0,"Mortensen should certainly do another western, soon. Preferably he should do one with a real sense of danger to go along with all the neat, tidy, highfalutin' honor and decency."
1,In its own quiet way it delivers the goods.
1,"A warmly made, slightly offbeat movie about friendly devotion. It also happens to be a western, and every man in it is grizzled or wizened or both."
1,"Filled with dusty light, craggy facial features and broad landscapes, it's a solid story that honors the traditions of the genre as it reworks them."
1,"For its first hour or so, Appaloosa is a crisply paced pleasure, mostly thanks to the interplay between Harris and Mortensen."
1,"A fine dramatic comedy with fresh characters, witty dialogue and a keen interest in how relationships must have developed among frontier folks, tyrannical ranchers, no-nonsense lawmen and -- oh, yes -- the complicated women on that frontier."
1,Appaloosa takes the traditional notion of a lone lawman fighting injustice and turns it successfully on its head.
0,"It was at times incredibly slow and even poorly edited, and I've never understood the appeal of Renee Zelwegger."
1,Ed Harris does it better than anybody.
1,Brush away the dust and you'll find a sense of nostalgia and romanticism about lost American values and altered social hierarchies.
0,"The often impressive Mortensen can't make Halder much more than a stereotypical academic milquetoast. Other perfs come off just adequate, though not for lack of effort."
1,Absorbing drama about a good man who is blind to the horrors of Germany's Nazi regime.
0,"Despite its rather highbrow pedigree, Good's journey along its predetermined path from book burnings to concentration camps reeks of middlebrow button-pushing, which the cast's clipped British accents do nothing to dispel."
1,"Good is pretty schematic ??betraying its theatrical roots, perhaps. It's also a little drawn out. But it demonstrates the surprising power of character flaws in drama."
0,A really terrible movie based on what I imagine was a far more interesting 1981 play.
1,A subtle and quietly devastating film directed by Vicente Amorim from John Wrathall's delicately written adaptation of a play by C.P. Taylor.
0,"Though the film opens with an intriguing burnished look, it bogs down about halfway through with talkiness and uneven pacing. When reality finally dawns on Halder, it is not only too late for him to redeem himself, but too late for the audience to care."
0,"To those who wonder if we really need Hollywood to give us more Holocaust stories, I would argue yes, just better ones than we get with Good."
0,Good is an anemic screen adaptation of C. P. Taylor's play about a respectable 'good German' who passively acquiesces to Hitler's agenda.
0,It definitely wouldn't have done anyone involved with Good any harm to ask what relevance heavy-handed history plays have to do with the world of today.
0,"Morally speaking, everything about Good is tidily correct. But it is more a predictable parable than a full-fledged narrative."
0,"There are some striking locations and certainly the era continues to fascinate audiences (and, particularly this year, filmmakers). Too bad, then, that this is such a disappointment -- awkwardly directed and flatly scripted."
0,"We know just what each character will do, and exactly where each path will lead. And we're never wrong."
0,"The banality of evil has met its match in the banality of Good, a Holocaust parable that barely registers a pulse."
0,Viggo Mortensen looks the part but never brings it home with great conviction or passion. I never believed in the character and that greatly diminished the film's ability to argue its ethical case.
1,"Good has a stagy fustiness, but it's worth seeing for Mortensen, who makes this study of ??a 'good German' look creepily contemporary. He shows us the horror ??of ignorance."
0,Good contributes very little to a conundrum that has occupied historians and psychologists for half a century.
1,The subject -- self-deception and failure of nerve in an unjust world -- is too messy and horrible to laugh away.
1,"Mortensen ably carries most of the weight, with a minimalist performance."
1,"By all accounts, Taylor's play was a more experimental piece than this film, in which the production values, like the acting, veer between the acceptable and the stodgy."
0,"It's a thought-provoking theme, which is rather let down by a thoroughly unconvincingly turn from Mortensen."
1,"To its credit, Good is at least a piece with something serious to say, with little of the meretricious responsibility-deflecting that The Reader dealt in."
0,"We're gearing up for a clunker of a climax involving musically gifted interns at the world's sprucest concentration camp. Mortensen wears it well, but this feels like very old hat."
0,"It may have been a good stage play: people say it was. But its author, the late C.P. Taylor, was not around to stop it becoming a lousy film."
0,"Mortensen isn't bad, though he looks merely absent-minded rather than anguished."
0,"The original play, once dubbed one of the 100 best of the century, is fleshed out with skill by Amorim but somehow his film never comes fully to life. Even its melodramatic ending falls flat."
0,"Bears a superficial resemblance to ""The Conformist"" and ""The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,"" with their sense of dreary complacency, oppressively museum-like spaces, and curiously drab natural settings, but ultimately ""Good"" is less evocative"
1,"A film that is a combination immigrant/resurrection tale, Visitor tilts toward the soulful rather than the political and could be this year's humanistic indie hit."
1,Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy demonstrates that the critical acclaim for The Station Agent in 2003 was no fluke.
1,"A marvelous film, small in expense but big in stature."
1,"This audaciously issues-loaded indie drama works, improbably and entirely, on account of the marvelous, often familiar-looking, rarely starring character actor Richard Jenkins and his perfect performance as a stodgy, widowed economics professor."
1,This is a simple story of human drama that provides an incentive to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater during a spring that has not provided many such reasons.
1,"Tom McCarthy's The Visitor, from his own screenplay, is nothing short of a triumph for 60-year-old character actor Richard Jenkins, in his first leading role in a feature film."
1,This is a small picture that explodes the boundaries of what size really means. Sometimes it's the smallest gesture that makes you feel most alive.
1,"The curious thing about The Visitor is that even as it goes more or less where you think it will, it still manages to surprise you along the way."
1,"The Visitor, featuring an award-caliber performance by Richard Jenkins as the prof, is a heartfelt human drama that sneaks up and floors you."
1,"The Visitor is a low-key, naturalistic, beautifully observed character study about the quiet angst of the buttoned-down soul."
1,"All the main characters are inherently decent, and the humanity of their saga, which centers on illegal immigration, makes for a deeply moving film."
1,"Best movie I've seen so far this year? Hands down, it's Tom McCarthy's superb The Visitor, which turns Richard Jenkins, one of the best character actors in the business, into a full-fledged star."
1,Both director and cast exhibit the dedication of those who truly believe in the message at hand.
0,"McCarthy is so careful not to take a political stand that his film seems neutered by good intentions. In the spirit of squishy humanism, he soft-pedals a hard-hitting topic."
1,"The Visitor tells of renewal through love. Its song is tinged with sadness, but stirring all the same."
1,"The Visitor gives viewers a perceptive, deeply personal take on the timeless immigrant narrative, in which the most epic journey is finally one of self-discovery."
1,"Both halves of the story ring true in their way, but they don't ring out in harmony."
1,"Richard Jenkins and ""The Visitor"" make lovely music together. It's a case of a veteran character actor slipping on a leading role like the most comfortable pair of pants in the world."
1,This gifted writer/director knows how to illuminate those moments in which people realize they have become essential to each other -- that each person's life has been gently changed by the other's presence.
1,"McCarthy puts a mark on each film, identifying it as distinctly his own. A couple more like them, and he'll be knighted an auteur."
1,"This is a film of our times -- paranoid, heartbroken, disillusioned -- and the rare recent American movie whose characters react the way actual people might."
1,The script here is very strong.
1,[Richard Jenkins] gets the role of a lifetime in this powerful second film by writer-director Thomas McCarthy.
1,"The Visitor is a small movie, but its emotions could not be writ any larger."
0,The film becomes less about the suffering of immigrants who have never enjoyed the embrace of Ellis Island than the righteous indignation of a liberal intelligentsia raging against its own powerlessness.
1,"The story of Vale's revitalization and his grief is compelling but simple, free of any sentimentality, and marked by powerful performances from Jenkins and Hiam Abbass, who plays Mouna Khalil, Tarek's mother."
1,"At first glance Walter isn't a guy you want to spend two hours with. But by the end of the film, you don't want to see him go. Jenkins is like that: He sneaks up on you and steals your heart with light-fingered skill."
1,"The Visitor is a tiny treasure of a movie. This is a wistful comedy that quickly finds its rhythm, but never lets that groove become a rut."
1,"A beautiful, quiet, measured movie about the death of some American values since September 11, 2001."
0,
0,"Husband-and-wife helmers Melisa Wallack and Bernie Goldmann make all the wrong choices, from the grimacing they've encouraged their large (and largely wasted) cast to indulge in, to the musical riffs that signal each and every dramatic beat."
0,"When all is said and done, Bill is let down by Bill."
0,"Even a hilarious turn by Kristen Wiig as the owner of a doughnut company can't save this clich챕d, meandering story from playing like American Beauty lite."
0,"Male midlife crisis presents as pathological self-loathing in Meet Bill, an imperative to which the only sane response is: No thanks."
0,This movie never should have seen the light of day.
0,"The story of a man (Aaron Eckhart) grappling with middle-age ennui at work and at home feels done to death, as does the distracting addition of a spunky rich-kid high schooler."
0,"Teeters between film genres, not ever quite making up its mind what it strives for."
0,"Pic is dramatic but lacks a dynamic; one can sense the director's intent and affection for the form, but also see that working in this stylized vein does not necessarily come easily for a filmmaker of his hitherto more naturalistic tendencies."
1,The movie is a goof on Hitchcock and Sirk -- a period (late forties) soap opera with nasty sexual undertones and the omnipresent threat of murder.
1,"Stylish without being overly stylized, intelligent without being boring, Married Life is a classy throwback to the good old days when subtlety meant something at the movies and watching Hitchcock was a good reason to stay home."
1,Sachs gets terrific performances out of his actors.
1,[The] four principal actors are such worthy vehicles for sustaining the throbbing pace and shifting moods of this chamber piece that it's difficult to single anyone out.
1,Married Life is much more about the enduring relationship between husband and wife than it is about the excitement between husband and girlfriend.
1,A playful riff on film noir that starts by upending every '40s movie clich챕.
1,"Married Life, a period comedy of manners merged with a suspenseful psychological thriller, aspires to be a hybrid of the sort that Alfred Hitchcock polished to perfection."
0,"Rather than real emotion, the movie stops at irony...It's an entertaining approach, all right, but it does the material no real service."
0,"Just when things should be boiling over, the script goes lukewarm."
1,"This subtle dance around morality is as seductive as the elegantly designed rooms it takes place in, where even the shadows are cozy."
0,"Maybe it is about compromise, after all, because though Married Life has its moments, it's bewildering as a whole."
1,The cast is first-rate but nothing goes very far in this film.
1,"Cooper and Clarkson are sublime in creating a marriage still filled with tenderness, even as they lie to each other with breezy consistency."
0,It's only about as interesting as...married life.
1,"It's strange. It's different. It's arresting, and it's definitely intentional. Ira Sachs knew what he wanted to do, and he's a talent worth watching."
0,Sirk or Billy Wilder could have done something with it. Sachs still has a ways to go.
0,"A macabre comedy of manners with the sting of dry ice, this 2007 ensemble piece captures the social climate of America in the late 40s."
0,"Married Life is structured like a Douglas Sirk melodrama or a Hitchcock thriller rather than a mystery, but it's a mystery nonetheless, because it's rarely clear what Sachs intends the movie to be."
1,"You may not like it if you insist on counting the deck after the game and coming up with 52. But if you get 51 and are amused by how the missing card was made to vanish, this may be a movie to your liking."
0,"Sachs and Moverman have scripted a potboiler, but unwisely kept the lid on. Their intent is wry philosophical detachment; the effect is a biting social satire gone soggy."
1,"Married Life has enough plot twists and moments of high tension to keep the viewer engaged, but the main points of interest are the characters."
1,"[Director] Sachs has assembled a stellar ensemble cast, and much of the pleasure of Married Life is watching the subtle detail the actors bring to their roles."
0,"A curious, provocative if unsatisfying little movie."
0,It's strange how a movie with this many different things happening could be so dull.
0,"This quiet, closed-in picture with its unsurprising twists and turns, lacks the steamy passion of its pulp roots."
1,"Married Life is an engaging romance noir, a sort of updated The Postman Always Rings Twice that packs its surprises into four characters, none of them predictable."
0,"It oscillates between stale period piece and unengaging melodrama, coyly seducing viewers with the potential it fails to fulfill."
1,"Offers audiences movie pleasures, as well as emotionally authentic challenges."
0,"It's as dry as the martinis these well-dressed stiffs keep ordering at that perfectly preserved oak, leather and velvet bar before hopping into their vintage convertibles."
1,"Sachs combines humor, suspense, and twists of plot that keep the ground shifting under our feet."
1,"It looks beautiful, and the convoluted plotting is initially the right side of Hitchcock pastiche, but the central conundrum is teased out over so many twists and false climaxes that ultimately it's a shrug, not a shock, which greets the denouement."
0,"It's a good cast, with Cooper outstanding, but Sachs's direction is stodgy and the screenplay is grindingly self-conscious."
1,"The movie is determinedly low-key, but honest, with a wrenching break-up scene, sharp work from Clarkson, and a final thought that lingers, about never really knowing what your other half is thinking."
1,"A well-acted but lugubrious noir, which is somehow not quite thrilling enough to be a thriller, and not quite profound enough to be a character study."
1,"The layers of deception are as meticulously constructed as the impeccable 1940s production and costume design. Unfortunately, the film doesn't maintain that distinctive noir cruelty, as hard as red lacquered finger nails."
1,
0,Badland practically begs 'For Your Consideration' without the substance to justify its awards-season epic length.
1,The mawkish yet weirdly mesmerizing film Badland is independent in scale but aggressively Hollywood in storytelling.
0,"The year's dullest movie has arrived: the deeply silly Badland, which is as dead as winter and twice as long."
0,Possibly the worst idea for a movie this century.
1,"Expertly constructed and beautifully photographed, Badland easily sustains its 160-minute running time, and the portrayals of Draven, a British actor, and 9-year-old Fulton can stand alongside the year's best."
0,"The raw material would seem to be in place for a strong, moving contemporary tragedy, but scene after endless scene fails to come to life."
0,"When the picture gets around to its calculated socko ending, the viewer has long been pummeled into a state of numbness."
0,The murders are simply chalk marks on a blackboard with no build-up and little fallout.
0,A polished but verbose whodunit that's surprisingly buttoned-down given helmer Alex de la Inglesia's rep for comicbook wackiness.
0,This purported whodunit thriller never solves its main mystery: How and why did this film get made in the first place?
1,"This taut, savvy cyber-thriller makes for one of the better net flicks."
1,Untraceable is a satisfying slice of solidly crafted meat-and-potatoes filmmaking.
0,"Untraceable engenders a reaction that is one part fascination, one part disappointment, and two parts frustration."
0,"Untraceable hasn't the brains of a class-act psychothriller like Silence of the Lambs, and lacks the balls to juice up the trashy verve of the Saw series. Stuck in the middle, it leaves everyone stranded, actors and audience alike."
0,"Untraceable is one of those deplorably gratuitous movies that wants to have it both ways, but gets nothing right."
0,Talk about your pious frauds. I've got a better way to show your disgust for Internet scum: Don't see Untraceable.
1,"Untraceable has flaws, but this cat-and-mouse team is so hypnotic that all you do is sit there waiting while they deliver one big shock after another."
0,"Over and over again, Hoblit misses opportunities to make an engaging picture, instead giving us a merely pedestrian one."
1,"Lane skillfully sells the tech-heavy script. But after a much-too-early reveal of the murderer's identity, the 'low battery' signal starts to flash on this film by thriller specialist Gregory Hoblit."
0,By now the hypocrisy of simultaneously condemning and exploiting the audience's sadism has become so commonplace in American movies it hardly seems noteworthy.
0,Suspense remains at a minimum.
0,"In addition to being dull, Untraceable is a monster hypocrite, wagging its finger at the mass audience's appetite for strictly regimented, 'creative' torture scenarios. This film is not really in a position to point a finger."
0,"Untraceable wants us to deplore the amoral voyeurism of the cyberspace mobs, yet feeds off it at the same time."
0,"As Untraceable descends into the progressively more perverted territory, it begins to practice the very hypocrisy it condemns in its audience, engaging in the rancid voyeurism it pretends to abhor."
0,"There's a good movie to be made about the power of the virtual mob, the ethical consequences of participating in it, the costs of free will. But Untraceable isn't it, not by a long shot."
0,"Morally duplicitous torture porn: how else to describe Untraceable, a bleak, rain-washed horror thriller."
0,"This joyless thriller runs the gamut from unconscionable through unwatchable to unendurable. It's also unfathomable that two talented people, Diane Lane and her director, Gregory Hoblit, got themselves involved in such an unpromising enterprise."
0,Untraceable feels sleazy and gratuitous.
0,"Untraceable demonstrates, once again, how unnecessary it is for audiences actually to understand technical jargon."
0,Untraceable really is disgraceable.
0,"As plain awful as Untraceable is, possibly the worst thing about it is that it pretends to mean something."
0,"Untraceable isn't unwatchable, but it's a pretty miserable experience, from a director who knows better."
0,"Untraceable often seems to go out of its way to tip off what's coming, so that it's hard to tell whether the film's writers are lazy, clumsy or just painfully obvious."
0,"From its obvious foreshadowing to Marsh's big PowerPoint presentation of the killer's cause-and-effect, Untraceable is a mite too traceable to get under the skin."
0,"The movie chides us for being a sick voyeuristic society, hungry for the sight of violence. The purity of this moral stance is somewhat clouded by the movie's habit of staging sick violent acts."
0,Untraceable essentially forces its audience to identify with those who would be willing accomplices to torture and murder.
1,A diverting police procedural.
0,"The film teases and unnerves for 100 minutes with scenes of cold brutality. Then in a rush to the end, it tries to make it all better, or at least make it more complicated."
0,"Hoblit and veteran cinematographer Anastas Michos try to darken the proceedings by giving us nocturnal characters and Portland at its grayest. But it's window dressing, just like the layers of computer geek-speak that can't disguise an analog-age plot."
0,"An abhorrent cyberthriller starring a compelling Diane Lane, the film exploits the inhumanity of torture as it cynically condemns Internet rubberneckers (and by extension, moviegoers) for watching it online."
0,The makers of Untraceable don't have that high an opinion of you.
1,"Untraceable is a horrifying thriller, smart and tightly told, and merciless."
0,Feels as if it's been patched together using 'auto-fill' screenwriting software.
0,You know something ain't kosher when a movie purporting to offer a critique of sadistic voyeurism opens with a hand-rubbing scene of kitten abuse.
1,"Lane is an imaginative actress, every bit as good as Jodie Foster, and the film is clothed in a dark and chilly atmosphere that Hoblit constructs with some skill."
0,"The problem with Hollywood films condemning the public appetite for torture is that they frequently pander to it, and this is a very lurid and unsavoury example."
0,"Very unpleasant, though skilfully put together by director Gregory Hoblit and acted with beyond-the-call empathy by Ms Lane."
1,"This new variation on the theme isn't bad, in a gruesome and horrible way, and features a strong performance from Diane Lane as an FBI agent."
1,"On the surface the film is a solid thriller, but there's more thought here than in the average serial killer flick."

0,"People sometimes had ordinary, reasonably polite conversations, even in the '80s. Not absolutely all the talking was affectless mumbling, angry recriminations, drug deals or TV news about Ronald Reagan."
0,"The Informers is the kind of movie that, upon leaving the theater, provokes the urge to take a shower."
0,"Occasionally, some fool gets the idea that his literary wretched excess would make for a good film."
0,"There's plenty of incident, but not much plot. As befits a tale of absolute self-absorption and unconscious revelation, The Informers often seems to be telling on itself."
0,"A rancid load of swill called The Informers, from a depraved 1994 book by Bret Easton Ellis, is, like The Soloist, a look at the underbelly of L.A., but the resemblance ends there."
0,Do some blow. Curse humanity. Convert to nilhilism. Reread American Psycho. But don't for the love of God and cinema see The Informers.
0,"It's a movie with Altmanesque pretensions, but under Gregor Jordan's flat-line direction amounts to flipping through an out-of-date fashion magazine, one that barely spurs the energy to point and laugh."
0,"Ellis' book, though a grim read, had a satirical edge to it that made it darkly enjoyable; the movie is simply dark and dull. And vampireless, more's the pity."
0,"The piece had better have something fresh to say. The Informers doesn't, nor does it seem to want to."
0,"A nihilistic, narcissistic, knuckleheaded move about nihilistic, narcissistic knuckleheads, The Informers might have been an interesting exercise in satire, if it only had a sense of humor. Which it doesn't."
0,The dialogue is laughable. Lines are spoken so languidly that the actors seem bored. Shattering revelations are delivered in the same monotone as casual patter.
0,"The Informers should be more aware of its own unsavoryness, and revel in it a little. As it is, the movie is far too weighty, as though it were honestly trying to convey some kind of cautionary message."
0,"Perhaps the film's biggest mistake is that after more than an hour of proving how pointless and vapid these characters are, it leaves us with a parting shot indicating we should care about what happens to them. We don't."
0,"An outbreak of '80s nostalgia is the best explanation for The Informers, a worse movie based on a worse Bret Easton Ellis book."
0,"If The Informers doesn't sound to you like a pleasant time at the movies, you are right."
0,"It's by far the most slack, ho-hum movie ever made from Ellis' material."
0,The Informers is a movie so seamy it makes you want to take a bath afterward. Rarely has so much sin seemed so boring.
0,"This one's a certifiable soul-sucker, dining out on its characters' venalities while wagging a finger at the horror, the horror."
0,Gregor Jordan's pointless adaptation of a Bret Easton Ellis book is successful only in the sense that it accurately mimics the emptiness of its subject.
0,Repulsive 80s flashback.
0,"The film is as flat as the Hollywood sign, with beautiful young people, all blonde, mostly naked, trying desperately to get up the energy to order something else from room service."
0,"The performances run the gamut from twitchy to catatonic, and the stoned stiffness of the actors seems to have less to do with the affectlessness of the characters than with their own confusion."
0,The Informers is such a wretched piece of garbage that there's a certain amount of guilt attached to even writing about it.
0,Ellis's big notions are less insightful than they pretend to be.
1,"Has an air of detachment and sadness, enhanced by the movie's being set a full quarter century ago. Like new cars in an old movie, these people may glow with youth, but we watch them in full awareness of the beaters and wrecks they'll become."
0,
0,This just felt like a bunch of people in 1980s L.A. with blonde streaks in their hair listening to Wang Chung.
0,Gorgeous people and some well written dialogue aren't enough to make this a movie you should see.
1,"We may not care about these cokeheads, but only rarely does Jordan fall into knee-jerk retribution."
0,"Directed by Gregor Jordan, Ellis's aimlessly dissolute collection of stories just doesn't hang together as a coherent whole."
0,"There is a weird, almost comic absence of insight and perspective here. But it is a joke without humour and without a punchline."
0,"This self-penned adaptation of his 1994 short story collection - a period piece set in 1983 Los Angeles - has supposedly been cut to ribbons, and it shows."
1,Jordan gives all this an entirely appropriate sheen and the cast play well through glazed eyes. The film will fascinate those who love to see the tormented lives of those who seem luckier than the rest of us.
0,"Bret Easton Ellis pens a mean tale, in all adjectival senses. His prose is artfully maleficent; he is a laid-back Severus Snape of the sex-and-drugs generation. You need a smarter directing hand, though, than Gregor Jordan's."
0,"Director Gregor Jordan seems to have gone into reverse since his 2001 Buffalo Soldiers, aiming for the LA rondeau of Altman's Short Cuts but missing all the vital ingredients - wit, humanity, charm, nuance and meaning."
0,"It has a good cast and a terrific 1980s soundtrack (Devo, Simple Minds), but it also has the superficiality of a TV soap. The Informers is not so bad that you can't sit back and enjoy it, but nor is it good enough to go and see."
1,"Rating less than zero on the sophistication scale, The Informers is thus a totally faithful adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel--and an accurate look at early '80s-era Los Angeles."
0,
1,The film manages to capture the palpable frustration on the ground.
1,"I think it is time for us to take a film like Meeting Resistance very seriously indeed, and to ponder its message very carefully, despite my abiding doubts about its ultimate reliability as a guide to our actions."
1,"Although at times tedious and repetitive, Meeting Resistance is nonetheless an important journalistic document about the Iraqi insurgency."
0,A little resistance might have done the project some good.
1,"If nothing else, Meeting Resistance should dispel any lingering misconception that the Iraq insurgency is mainly the work of outside agitators."
1,"Offers a rare glimpse into the hearts and minds of those who have dedicated themselves to ridding Iraq of its invaders, captured by intrepid reporters who risked their lives at a time when fragile trust was still possible."
0,The problem with the film is that it makes for better journalism than cinema.
1,Meeting Resistance is worth the effort. It tells a nuanced story of the Iraqi resistance that American media rarely has fleshed out.
1,"Of all the Iraq documentaries that have been released since the war began five years ago, this is the one that most seriously addresses the nature of the insurgency."

1,"The Freshman is a dawdling, occasionally amusing stunt."
1,A quirky sleeper with something truly unexpected around every corner.
0,"A great actor's self-parody might be fascinating, especially if the actor is Brando. But the performance Brando gives here is anything but a good-natured goof on himself."
1,There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?
1,"With Brando around, The Freshman has a snappy madness that's hard to resist."
1,A witty and enchanted comedy.
1,"The casting, needless to say, is perfect, and Bergman keeps the various escalating intrigues clipping along at a brisk pace."
1,"Sweet and warm as well as manic, this is full of loopy surprises."
1,"The Freshman has a preposterous plot even the writer's mother couldn't believe, and it strains and creaks down the runway, but when this baby gets off the ground, we're talking seriously funny."
1,Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history.
1,No film offering the spectacle of a Komodo dragon being transported across a state line for immoral purposes can be lightly dismissed.
1,"Andrew Bergman's The Freshman is a charmed comedy, the kind of seemingly effortless movie in which everything falls neatly into place, as if ordained by nature."
1,Brando does a wonderful sendup of Corleone that manages to play off the Don's entrenched place in pop culture. But The Freshman is no copycat comedy.
0,"Though writer-director Andrew Bergman sets up potentially funny situations, the payoffs aren't nearly as clever as they need to be. Many situations don't pay off at all."
1,"Just when you've had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy."
1,"It's the kind of material that could easily fly apart into silliness, yet Brando and Broderick help the director to keep it anchored in a certain emotional reality, which is always the source of the richest comedy."
1,"Marlon Brando returns to the movies with one of his funniest performances as, in essence, Don Corleone with a screw loose."
0,"Half as amusing as that viral video of a sheep scaring its peeps while wearing a Halloween mask, A Bloody Aria is also less incisive."
1,"It may seem an odd thing to say about a film in which a baseball bat as an instrument of assault and rape is a recurring theme, but what makes A Bloody Aria a darkly delightful surprise is its restraint."
1,For the most part A Bloody Aria has an adept way of muddying these themes for audiences expecting the usual gore-thirsty trip.
0,A simply unpleasant experience.
1,"Still, Won pulls off a rare trick: to be funny and frightening while continuing to ratch the tension up and up. Performances, too, are top notch."
0,"It's slow, bloody and pretty much devoid of merit."
0,Time should surely now be called on the vogue in Korean cinema for black-comic ultraviolence.
1,"Director Won Shin-yun infuses the moralisms with a pulpy energy that recalls cheery shockers such as Hostel and Saw, while also indulging in Three Stooges-style bumpkin-knockabout humour."
0,"It's supposedly an essay on the nature of human brutality and there is a certain amount of narrative deftness at play, but whether in the sequences of dialogue or violence, in both cases extended, the film is not merely unattractive but also uninteresting"
0,"I suspect it falls between two stools: not nearly grisly enough for the aficionado of extreme Asian cinema, rather too grisly for everyone else."
0,"It all looks like Michael Haneke-lite but, as a comment upon the fact that people tamed by violence tend to promote it when given half a chance, it has its grimly amusing merits."

1,"The result is a minor masterpiece of tone in Kenny's portrayal of a character that is absurd, guileless and shrewd at the same time."
1,"Waste is a terrible thing to mind -- unless you are port-a-potty installer Kenny Smyth, the unlikely hero of a hilarious and fresh (figuratively speaking, of course) comedy from Down Under."
1,"A hit and prize winner in Australia, Kenny has the power to charm, no matter which way the water swirls."
1,"The Australian charmer Kenny, about a hard-working, jovial employee for a portable toilet company, is a low-key study of underdog pride rather than a Larry the Cable Guy bodily function jokefest."
1,"The film's real accomplishment, in this era of masked superheroes, is making a paladin of a regular guy whose ethics we can all emulate."
1,Funny enough to give scatology a good name.
1,Old-fashioned toilet humour gets a postmodern makeover in this laconic Australian mockumentary about a mobile toilet installer.
1,"If you didn't know better you'd think Kenny wasn't an actor, so naturalistic is Shane's performance and so true to milieu is Clayton's camera work."
1,"Few comic characters come with that degree of wit, let alone a philosophy."
1,"It's a risky strategy, but one that pays off triumphantly here."
1,An unexpectedly charming and bitingly funny mock doc.
0,"This is pre-packaged entertainment, a product designed to give bored teenagers something to watch on a Friday or Saturday night when steamy summer nights are getting longer and Labor Day is just around the corner."
1,"[A] well-crafted, feel-good satire."
1,This satire about an aging heavy metal drummer finds a good comic rhythm.
0,The only brazen thing about the film is how shamelessly it rips off School of Rock.
1,It is a goofy and amusing late summer film with more than enough laughs to recommend it.
0,It's depressing when the best thing you can say about a comedy is that its second-rateness is pleasantly in sync with its unmagnetic hero.
0,"Jack Black's fearless, foolish ferocity is missing."
0,"Like its protagonist, the movie is sweet but slow and a little out of date."
0,The Rocker might really have rocked if it didn't feel like a cover of a couple of superior comedies.
0,Audiences would be better served staying home and playing Rock Band than wasting their time on something as leaden and unfunny as The Rocker.
0,"A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers sitcom on the Disney Channel, The Rocker comes off as something penned by an old dude who hasn't bought music since it was sold 'on records.'"
0,"The film equivalent of an inoffensive throwaway track, what we used to call a B-side, back in the days of Vesuvius."
1,"The conflicts that arise are highly predictable. But there are plenty of funny moments, as well as a sweet subplot involving the unkempt drummer and the guitarist's no-nonsense mom."
0,A grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle.
0,"If only the movie had some bite, some edge, some anger, some insight. Instead it's generic, staying far away from the darker temptations of the rock scene."
1,"The Rocker is an amiable comedy, so efficiently constructed that you can practically see the computer software on how to write comedy screenplays at work. Nonetheless it is an enjoyable construction."
0,An innocuous late-summer entry that barely rises above the level of sitcom alternative to Olympic-coverage overload.
0,"The Rocker feels safe, a long way from the cutting edge, a PG guy in a PG-13 movie, a comedy with too much 'parental guidance' to be rock 'n' roll."
1,"If this isn't the laugh riot of the year, it's still a pleasant surprise, particularly for teen audiences. And in comedy seasons like this one, that's sometimes more than enough."
1,"The Rocker qualifies as a B-side, but it still makes for a passable summer single."
0,"Watching Rainn Wilson gyrate in The Rocker, you can't help wondering if Mr. Wilson is inhabiting a role that was originally turned down by Jack Black."
1,Manages to be a notably funnier than average summer comedy despite being a fairly shameless rip-off of School of Rock.
0,"While nobody's expecting This Is Spinal Tap, both the audience and the cast -- which is strong all around -- deserve better than the generic script and bland direction here."
0,"It sort of gurgles, with some pleasant-sounding pops here and there. But this is essentially a film that squanders a good idea by playing things too safely."
1,How much you ultimately like The Rocker will inevitably depend on how much you like Wilson. And a little goes a long way.
0,"You want to like almost everyone in this film, but they're all undone by a weak script that really wasn't worth more than a Gilmore Girls subplot after all."
1,"I don't want to oversell The Rocker, but in a summer of erratic, assaultive comedies all up and down the budget scale, this Rainn Wilson vehicle -- a kind of Home School of Rock -- stakes out its own corner of the market."
0,It's not exactly heartwarming to realize that The Rocker's Gen X fantasy of an escape from middle age is really a developmental nightmare.
0,"It's a slave to formula, and it hits its marks satisfyingly enough to make for a pleasant time-passer, but Wilson and a loaded supporting cast are never as funny as they should be."
1,"The Rocker has the requisite vomit, the view of some very unfortunate hind quarters and the suds. It's also got a vein of sweetness and charm."
0,The melody of The Rocker feels predictable but the beat is refreshingly off-kilter.
1,"As a movie, it may not rock, but it rolls along nicely enough."
0,"There are occasionally amusing moments, but the writing lacks the warmth that made School of Rock such a hit."
0,It all looks good and there's a decent cast but nothing really takes off.
0,"The film is untidy, cheery, sometimes amiable. If only it were funny too."
1,"Director Peter Cattaneo will probably never repeat his Full Monty success, but even in its mediocre patches one senses a renewed eagerness to entertain."
1,"The Rocker is certainly not This Is Spinal Tap, but it is fair to moderate entertainment and Rainn Wilson holds it all together energetically."
1,"A whacked-out, superannuated, would-be rock star might seem to be too easy a comic target, but Wilson gives this sad sack so many fresh twists that he never wears out his welcome."

0,There's a lot of sap in this Christmas tree.
0,"There's not a single scene in Holiday that doesn't feel like it was copied from any number of other cookie-cutter rom coms, Christmas-themed or otherwise."
0,"In the annals of Noel films so wincingly, gratingly, insultingly bad that a lump of coal would be vastly preferable, The Perfect Holiday ranks alongside Surviving Christmas for sheer unwatchability."
1,The messages here are what you'd expect: Love your family. Don't be selfish. Don't tell lies. Have a happy holiday. Christmas doesn't have to be perfect to entertain you. Just like this movie.
0,"Ostensibly a Christmastime comedy about romance, The Perfect Holiday manages to be none of the above."
0,"The actors distinguish themselves mainly by their ability to make the material, directed and co-written by Lance Rivera, seem even more painfully awkward and unfunny than it already is -- which is very."
0,"The Perfect Holiday makes the safest, blandest choices possible in delivering some Christmas cheer for the whole family."
0,"Despite the flabby direction and uninspired plot, The Perfect Holiday almost works because Chestnut and Union are an attractive couple and you want them to get together."
1,"[Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard] may be a draw, but it's too bad no one thought the endearing performances in this charming (if clich) family romance would be enough."
0,"Jovial and junky as all get out, The Perfect Holiday is about what you'd expect from a holiday comedy daring to put 'perfect' in its title. As in anything but."
0,"The Perfect Holiday, as many a holiday movie before it, meticulously goes through the motions, but never quite finds the magic of the season."
0,[The script] hasn't been written as much as stamped out like so many cheap Christmas knickknacks that will be on the clearance shelf come Dec. 26.
0,"The Perfect Holiday, directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn't believe in itself."
0,The cold void of January can't come fast enough if it means an end to releases like The Perfect Holiday.
0,It's a shame that Gabrielle Union can't get better scripts than this one.
0,The sparks that [Union and Chestnut] ignite onscreen cannot save the disjointed mess of a film that is The Perfect Holiday.
0,Dear Santa: Please leave better scripts under her Christmas tree.
0,"There's not much original about the film, but it's played with high spirits and good cheer, there are lots of musical interludes, and it's pitched straight at families."
0,"For fans of lousy seasonal cheer, Dec. 25 comes early."
0,"Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard act as commentators, nudging the contrivances this way and that."
1,The Perfect Holiday is so modest and good-natured that its flaws are hardly glaring.
0,[A] wretched yuletide comedy.
0,"If tickets to this yuletide dreck are hiding in your stocking, you'd be better off with a lump of coal."
0,I'd rather watch 90 minutes of a flickering yule log video than sit through this overcooked Christmas goose again.

0,"An overlong, dramatically unbalanced pic whose emotional wallop gets somewhat diffused."
1,The film works on a slow burn but by the end it has become utterly engrossing.
1,Give some patience to The Secret of the Grain and the rewards are there for the reaping.
1,[A] captivating film.
0,"After two and a half hours, The Secret of the Grain, ends, as arbitrarily as it began."
1,French-Tunisian writer-director-actor Abdellatif Kechiche's The Secret of the Grain is a sprawling yet intimate tale set among the Arab working class of the Mediterranean port Ste.
1,"The cast is solid, with standout performances by first-timer Habib Boufares as Slimane."
1,"The richness of The Secret of the Grain lies in the close, tireless, enthusiastic attention it pays to the most mundane daily tasks."
1,"The Secret Of The Grain is more complicated than it sounds, less geared toward uplift than in revealing the fault-lines within this sprawling, multi-generational family and between their immigrant culture and their French hosts."
1,"[Director] Kechiche digs a good story out of the flux, and, in the movie's final forty minutes, the suspense is terrific."
1,"I wish The Secret of the Grain had another title, something that conveys the vibrancy teeming in this great drama of daily life -- something less grainy."
1,"The Secret of the Grain never slows, always engages, may continue too long, but ends too soon. It is made of life itself."
1,"The wonderful thing about Hafsia Herzi in The Secret of the Grain...is the way she and the character tiptoe around the story's edges for a while, taking their time and easing onto the audience's radar."
1,"Rather than observing this family, we feel we are part of it, and that draws us in as nothing else can."
1,"The Secret of the Grain takes one man, his children, their spouses and babies, his ex-wife, his girlfriend, her daughter, and his friends and turns it all into a masterpiece about the strange power of food -- to heal, unite, exasperate."
0,A ponderous tragedy about put-upon manhood? A verite snoop into cultures that are sexually mingled but publicly uneasy? A pill to be swallowed in the name of serious filmgoing? Maybe all of these.
1,"Time stretches out to the limits of endurance, Slimane's and ours, and there are moments toward the conclusion of this picture when you will want to scream and throw things at the screen, but it's mesmerizing. When it does end, suddenly, it feels a little"
1,"Never sagging, it unfolds over 2 1/2 hours. Nothing is overexplained. Indeed, it takes us time to suss out Slimane's various familial relationships."
1,
0,Director Brad Silberling can't seem to decide whether he's making fun of the show's cheesy visuals or seizing on its sense of roughhewn adventure.
0,"Modernizing a 1970s children's TV show known for its cheap special effects offered certain possibilities, but the filmmakers have traded in any kid-friendly elements for bathroom humor of dinosaur-sized proportions."
0,"Land of the Lost has stray amusing ?쮝idbits, but overall it leaves you feeling splattered."
0,"Many of the bits are far too adult for children, yet no adult with a brain bigger than a walnut -- inside joke the filmmakers evidently thought was hilarious -- would find the story the least bit compelling."
0,"Stupid on an epic scale or epic on a stupid one, Land of the Lost is as close as Will Ferrell comes these days to a 'kid friendly' movie."
0,"Land of the Lost becomes an endurance test -- one that's too borderline bawdy for families and too dull and rote for anyone over 15. Who, exactly, is the intended audience for this drivel?"
0,"Genially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more."
0,"It doesn't help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material, with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck, and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations."
0,A soulless special effects flick crossed with a tired gross-out comedy.
0,This Land exists at the bottom of the pop-cultural barrel.
0,"Not a children's movie, but a movie for people with childlike minds, Land of the Lost"" combines the kind of juvenile humor that might amuse a 14-year-old with a shoddy plot that wouldn't satisfy a 5-year-old."
1,"Audiences of a certain sort will be dumbstruck by how high the silliness gets piled; but whether or not you're puffin' stuff, you'll likely get lost in laughter."
1,"Confronted with such effects, the actors make not the slightest effort to appear terrified, amazed or sometimes even mildly concerned. Some might consider that a weakness. I suspect it is more of a deliberate choice, and I say I enjoyed it."
0,"Lame sketch comedy, an uninspired performance from Will Ferrell and an overall failure of the imagination turn Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost into a lethargic meander through a wilderness of misfiring gags."
0,"Dull, unfunny, and completely unsuitable for viewing by anyone who isn't a charter member of the Will Farrell fan club."
0,"The movie is 90 minutes of bickering and blase under-reaction to outrageous events, interrupted by gross-out scraps such as Ferrell's run-in with an enormous mosquito, which ends with a tremendous amount of blood and guts."
0,"Pity the unwitting parents who take their kids to see Land of the Lost, Will Ferrell's terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy -- and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny -- experiment in 'family entertainment.'"
1,It all amounts to a certain brand of comedy -- something closer to long-form Dada than conventional humor.
0,"When it comes to movies, there's good stupid and there's just plain stupid. Land of the Lost is just plain stupid, and that's not good."
0,"Land of the Lost is harmless enough. It just isn't, with the exception of a few odd air pockets, particularly funny."
0,What next: The Banana Splits movie?
0,"It's hard to say what audience Silberling had in mind. For the kids, there's a steady parade of dinosaurs, time-travel adventures and absent-minded- professor jokes. But there are no kids to identify with."
1,"Always weird, sometimes aimless but occasionally really funny."
0,"With his belligerent blankness and gawky aplomb, Ferrell has made me laugh as much as any comic of his generation, but he's not doing anything fresh in Land of the Lost."
1,"Land of the Lost is an enjoyable regression to Saturday mornings gone by, as junky and sweet as a strawberry Pop-Tart."
0,"[The screenwriters] haven't given Ferrell a single witty line, which may explain why he seems to be so grimly going through the motions. The jokes aren't just worn out, they're clubbed to death."
0,"This dramatically, thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of $100 million to make and isn't worth the celluloid it's printed on."
0,"Land of the Lost is not completely terrible, and it moves briskly and safely, even though its more laugh-worthy bits have already been seen in endless commercials for the movie."
0,"The only discernible intention in Land of the Lost, the latest comedy starring Will Ferrell acting like Will Ferrell, seems to have been to take a slight idea and make the least of it in a very expensive way."
0,Will Ferrell and Danny McBride can find the dumb fun in anything. Too bad that Land of the Lost is so much less than anything.
0,Not exactly a hundred million dollars' worth of classic comedy.
0,"The only marginally interesting, if unsurprising, thing about Land of the Lost is that a lot of money has been spent on yet another cultural throwaway."
0,"Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, Quantum Paleologist. Well, kinda. He's really just Will Ferrell, Guy Who Wears Speedos No Matter What Movie He's In."
1,"The interesting thing, though, when you actually see ""Land of the Lost,"" is that it ... essentially functions as a high-cost, high-gloss parody of itself."
1,Farrell and McBride are great together at times in this movie.
0,"Danny McBride is funny in the movie, not nearly often enough."
0,"The original was unbelievably cheesy in its special effects but more sophisticated in its concepts, employing real science-fiction writers to work up ideas. Will Ferrell and partners have succeeded in reversing those priorities in this spoof."
0,"A ragbag of lackadaisical plotting, drugs references, puerile lechery and shiny effects work, an assemblage far from child-friendly yet not quite grungey enough to wow older teens."
0,A doughily inexpressive Will Ferrell extinguishes any flicker of originality in one of the worst performances of his career.
1,"It is very surreal, absurd, and often quite gross, with loads of very arch and knowing gags. It's not going to win any awards. Really, it's a DVD rental. There are some laughs. I laughed, anyway."
0,"The humour is lame and more than a little smutty, while the plot barely hangs together."
0,"Neither conventional action-adventure or enough of an out-there pastiche, this really is the land of the lost."
0,"It's not clear whether the director, Brad Silberling, is camping it up or simply trying to get through it all without too much strain."
0,"Will Ferrell capers earnestly through a Journey to the Center of the Earth-style comic romp witless of script, wan of invention and pasty of imagery."
0,"It's a kind of cut-price Jurassic Park, with a support cast of gabbling monkeys and lizardish humanoids, and if they don't seem far-fetched you might believe Anna Friel as a Cambridge- educated scientist."
0,"By and large, it's knockabout kids' stuff (and has been advertised on that basis), but it has some quite risqu챕 smut."
0,[A] gigantic chunk of scat.

0,"Lazily scripted, without even a pretense of character development or psychological depth, it offers nothing new for genre fans and no reason for mainstream auds to bite."
1,"A brilliantly staged early scare signals that the safety rails are off and, despite an unexpected, last-minute swerve into the supernatural realm, the edge-of-the-seat tension is sustained to the very last second."
1,[Rec] will definitely jangle the nerves. But it's a movie that's unlikely to last in the memory.
0,"The Spanish horror movie Rec promises, in the first act at least, to be a profoundly disturbing experience."
0,"Midway through, the plot blows a gasket and the camerawork turns altogether crazed, joggling us about in the semi-darkness while the soundtrack rings to distorted screams."
1,Unexpectedly amusing and inevitably disturbing.
1,A skillful examination of the things people do when they think no one's looking.
0,"Look isn't processing, critiquing, or even warning; in the end, it's just recording."
0,"Beginning and ending his film with a strip tease, Rifkin suggests some leering adolescent who's gotten his hands on a pair of X-ray glasses and sees nothing but randy, flatulent fools in his midst."
1,"A funny, filthy, dark-hearted ensemble drama."
0,"There are some funny moments, + occasional nudity and sex, but the joke quickly wears off. What might have worked as a half-hour TV show doesn't suit itself to a feature-length film."
1,Orwell would have loved it.
0,"With its emphasis on its interweaving stories, the movie offers no commentary on the phenomenon of increasingly pried-apart privacy, positive or negative."
0,"Look, an unsettling, rudely funny but not entirely credible feature by the writer and director Adam Rifkin, is an ensemble narrative for the age of public surveillance."
0,"If the idea is that we're always being watched, why does it seem that in this movie, no one's really paying attention?"
1,"The performances feel natural, improvised, and it's easy to believe this is the world we inhabit."
0,Movies like this frustrate me because they do not have enough ambition to match their imagination.
0,"Regrettably, and despite a lot of effects -- including those watery tentacles he seems so fond of -- Kelly delivers a Big Reveal that is, frankly, boring."
0,The pic reveals the hazards of taking Twilight Zone material too far and too seriously.
0,"What button, on whose box, did Kelly push to get the money to make this awful, preposterous thriller?"
1,"The critical consensus is still out on Kelly, and The Box will do nothing to settle the ongoing argument regarding his ability to coalesce his wild conceits into digestible narratives."
0,"Instead of sweeping you along, The Box just sits there like something unclaimed at lost and found. Damaged goods."
0,"Kelly tries to gather so many ideas under this movie's umbrella: He has strong ideas about the necessity of compassion in everyday life. He wonders what awaits us after death. But he can't flesh out all of these ideas properly, or even haphazardly."
0,"Have you ever actually tried watching paint dry? A sloth walk? Grass grow? You can have all the thrills with none of the chills courtesy of The Box, the painfully sluggish new sci-fi morality play from Donnie Darko creator Richard Kelly."
0,"""The Box"" looks like a fairly nifty package of premise and paranoia until Kelly unpacks it, and a lot of both the fun and fear go out of the film as you feel it stumble towards the finish line and realize it's stuffed with recycled goods."
1,"It's not slick, standard sci-fi, sure -- and that's a good thing."
0,"After a slightly promising start, this great-looking but ultimately deeply confusing and unscary sci-fi/horror opus turns into a quite boring rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's post-Signs films."
1,Sincere and sinister and inevitably ambitious.
1,"If you make a preposterous movie that isn't boring, I count that as some kind of a triumph."
0,"Some directors, it must be said, only have one really good movie in them. We're starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group."
0,I think Kelly is a very inventive writer and I think he is his own worst enemy behind the camera.
1,"I think that Richard Kelly, from one film to the next, has gone in some very interesting and sometimes puzzling directions."
1,"Kelly, as he did in Donnie Darko, avoids obvious scare techniques. Instead, he makes the bizarre, the surreal, and the frightening emerge from normal reality."
0,"Kelly has talent, but for his next movie, he might try coming down to earth and forgetting about the people who control the lightning."
0,"Whatever you do, do not accept delivery of The Box, a package that doesn't know where it is going nor how to get there."
1,"While it's true that the film's sci-fi antics are far from watertight in the logic department, there's enough eccentricity and ambition at play to charm and bemuse in equal measure."
0,The clueless and overreaching ambition which has started to characterise [Richard Kelly's] cinematic failures comes into play again.
0,"This film just goes interminably on and on, like some pop video to a prog rock track from hell, padding things out to feature length with all sorts of incredible gibberish and extraneous nonsense."
1,"Kelly's obsessions are not entirely like anyone else's, which is a recommendation of sorts, and he shoots more beautifully than ever, which is another. I won't give up on him when his films are still this richly textured and high on their own ideas."
1,"Sinister, tense and at times ridiculous, The Box is a warped genre piece - Kelly's homage to 1970s science-fiction, with all the wobbly effects, timid housewives and pseudo-religious imagery that suggests."
0,"Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko made him famous, but to judge by this unhappy mess he's having trouble confirming his talent."
0,"A lot of stuff about Nasa, Mars exploration and amateur theatre - Sartre's Huis Clos and its glowing chestnut adages (""Hell is other people"") - add to the film's richness or, depending on opinion, its overcooked confusion."
0,The single question I wanted to ask was: how many more times will a studio allow Richard Kelly to commit career suicide?
1,Is it an odd film? Certainly. Will it creep you out more than it engages you? Probably. Should we be rewarding folks who are willing to step out of bounds and make us think? Definitely.
0,Kelly treats what is essentially a Stanford University psychology experiment with inflated somberness.

1,Touching if by-the-numbers.
1,"At a time when most films wallow in mankind's basest instincts, Man in the Chair is a rare, once-in-a-blue-moon kind of movie that celebrates the best qualities in people and makes you applaud the human race."
0,"Writer-director Michael Schroeder compulsively references canonical films and books, presumably in the hope that genius rubs off."
1,"Once its machinery is humming, it settles into a soothing fable of a last hurrah."
0,"For its first 45 minutes or so, and intermittently thereafter, Michael Schroeder's Man in the Chair feels, annoyingly, like a film school project."
0,It's a cute idea that a better filmmaker than writer-director Michael Schroeder could have done a lot with.
0,"[Director] Schroeder peppers scenes with snippets of classic films, and there's no doubting his deep love of cinema. But the honest truth is that no matter how generous your audience, it's never a good idea to remind us of other, better movies."
1,A ramshackle but likeable story
1,"Though they can't transcend writer-director Michael Schroeder's pointed contrivances, the actors tap into something achingly true in this valentine to Hollywood's below-the-line crafts people and society's castoffs."
1,[An] elegant documentary.
1,"By salvaging a troubled script with deep, committed, touching portrayals, Plummer and Walsh help prove Schroeder's points about how Hollywood isn't just the province of the rich, young and pretty."
0,The movie works so hard at juggling its clichs that it fails to generate interest in its story.
1,"Man In The Chair feels a bit like a high school movie project, which is appropriate since that's exactly what it's about."
1,"A fair-to-middling contemporary fantasy drama that, despite its surfeit of flashy effects, is mildly charming in the way it addresses the injustice of old folk having to live out their final years in decrepit homes."
0,
1,"[Director] Lee evokes the character of his varied Los Angeles environments, even if the human element feels as if it's been done -- and undone -- before."
0,"The film is too short because the characters just aren't sufficiently developed, but even at a scant 90 minutes, it feels way too long."
0,"[Director Chris Chan] Lee tries to innovate, but he relies on so many tricks -- woozy overexposures, rapid-fire slideshows -- that his movie looks like the product of a teenager playing with the camera on his new MacBook."
0,"Undoing, by the writer and director Chris Chan Lee, buries a potentially haunting pulp thriller beneath flashy tics."
0,"It's arty, murkily plotted and derivative of too many other movies."
0,A lack of incisive action takes the teeth out of croc pic...offering too few scares and insufficient tension for audiences to take the bait.
1,"Nasty, brutish and at 89 minutes just the right length."
1,Writer-directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki calibrate the tension with creditable skill.
1,"While the when-animals-attack genre has been a staple of direct-to-retail movies for decades now, this tries for a more realistic approach than the usual rubber or CGI reptile's buffet."
0,"There are some nice creepy chills to be had from the directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki's low waterlevel camera work, but ultimately the outlandishness of their real-life adventure deadens the visceral impact."
1,"Short, sharp and refreshingly nasty, it's a light antidote to all those heavy Oscar hopefuls clogging up the multiplex."
0,A wasted opportunity.
1,"Tapping into the primeval fear generated by these perfectly evolved killing machines, the filmmakers ratchet up the tension, while sustaining our interest in the fate of the trio."
1,"shrewdly shuffles together attractive young leads, cagey screen vets and a fantasy-fulfillment scenario in a slickly polished package"
1,"Loosely adapted from Ben Mezrich's best-selling Bringing Down the House, the movie stretches facts like taffy but never shirks its responsibility to entertain."
0,"A movie that wastes a lot of time and money and really, really shoulda stayed in Vegas."
0,"While I'm firm believer in the adage 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good story,' 21 doesn't spin a good enough yarn to justify all the changes."
1,"21 is built around some standard-issue plot mechanics, but it's still a clever and novel card-sharp thriller."
0,Numerous inane plot twists and a convenient villain whose behavior defies logic or meaning.
0,"The new blackjack dramedy 21 stands when it should hit, never doubles down and wimps out to the point that it turns a pretty compelling tale into a bust."
1,"21 makes for some slick escapist fantasy. Even if, and because, the fantasy has its roots in something real."
0,"Greed is good and comes without a hint of conscience in 21, a feature-length bore about some smarty-pants who take Vegas for a ride."
0,"It's a would-be parable about greed that emptily celebrates it, a drama about gifted people who are one-dimensional voids and, most laughable of all, a story about the giddiness of risk-taking that safely plays everything by the numbers."
0,Lack of originality is where 21 really deals a losing hand.
0,"Under Luketic's flaccid direction, 21 is another two-faced moralistic entertainment that shows us how much fun it is to live large, then punishes its characters for acting out our fantasies."
0,It's funny how movies based on real stories can be the most formulaic and predictable.
0,[Director] Luketic and his screenwriters preserve the excitement and a fair amount of the blackjack strategy -- yet somehow the whole exercise plays like a high-tech John Hughes movie.
0,"Inspired by the real-life story of the M.I.T. students who took Las Vegas casinos for millions, 21 has been reshaped to fit a simple movie template -- and it's nearly as much fun as watching an insurance professional compute actuarial tables."
0,A movie with an irresistible premise that ultimately collapses around the whole issue of motivation.
1,Real-life rags-to-riches Vegas scheme makes for glossy if lightweight fun.
0,"Repetitive, implausible and overlong."
1,"When Spacey and Fishburne really go at each other, 21 finally starts to add up to something."
1,"21 doesn't quite hit the jackpot, but with popcorn it should satisfy."
0,A none-too-winning blend of the unsettling and the unsurprising.
0,"Before sinking into a predictable morality tale, 21 coasts on the superficial thrill of watching casinos take a few hits, but gamblers looking for a how-to lesson on winning in Vegas will be putting their pencils down pretty quickly."
1,"This is really Spacey's picture, from the moment he fixes his gaze on Sturgess to the day when he finally, brutally cuts him loose. It's a fun performance, but a quiet one."
0,"The fascinating story of six college students who took Las Vegas for millions gets dealt a bad hand in 21, which turns their true-life saga into a slick, shallow and thoroughly generic caper flick."
0,"There's enough action here to keep you awake, but don't expect to walk away a winner."
0,"When the makers of the blackjack drama 21 stepped up to the table to place their bets, they opted to play it safe."
0,"Add it up and, in the game that pits your entertainment dollar against entertainment value, know this: The house wins again."
0,"It's disposable, watchable and forgettable filmmaking for would-be easy millionaires."
0,"The film is about a group of MIT students who used a very smart card-counting system to milk the casinos. But the movie blows off the deeper thrills of its source material to make a tidier, less compelling amorality play."
0,While you may stick with the film -- it's a slick time-waster -- you never believe it.
0,"By the time the end credits roll around, you realize nothing's actually been risked. It's the gambling equivalent of Go Fish."
0,"Like the Strip itself, it's all lights and music throbbing so hard you confuse yourself into thinking you're having fun."
0,"The students are so blandly written this never builds any suspense, though it probably has some value as an empowerment fantasy for debt-ridden collegians."
1,"Although it's definitely a fictionalization of a true story, they get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas."
1,Sturgess quietly sparkles as the born loser who struggles to adapt to life on winners' row.
0,"The whizzo-conceit and slick visual bling do give it an undeniably diverting buzz, yet the movie's cautionary formula shows its hand way before the clunky final reel."
1,It is the gilded embodiment of the American Dream.
1,"A breezy, fast-moving romp that trades well on its appeal as a glitzy caper movie about high-end scam artists without losing sight of its simmering greed-is-not-so-good theme."
0,"If only director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb had not opted for glitz. As filmmakers, they're playing for very low stakes."
0,"As ever with gambling films, it's difficult to convey the thrill of winning at second hand; the human-interest complications are unconvincing and Spacey himself, I'm afraid, is a lugubrious and deadening presence."
1,Slowly but expertly depicts the jousting courtship of an ill-fated love affair between a Parisian socialite and a Napoleonic war hero.
1,"If you appreciate their acting, and enjoy the words of the battle between them - during which the duchess prevaricates until it is too late - it will seem fascinating."
0,"The duologues between the couple seldom vary in tone: he's the doormat, and she wipes her silk slippers on him. Depardieu makes for a compelling presence, even if he's a bit one-note."
0,"In a tale of passion, don't we want passion? Instead of Rivette's painterly pose-striking tableaux, would we not like some madness and modernism?"
1,"Severe, sometimes subdued, but ultimately fascinating."
1,Terrific performances by the two leads make this a far more rewarding film than the rigorous formality might suggest.
1,"No lavish costume drama, it's instead a theatrical dissection of the spiteful games lovers play."
1,The whole thing is compelling from start to finish; 'cruel ironies' doesn't even begin to describe it.
1,"See it for the respectfully literal Balzac screen transcription. After all, I may have been wrong about Mr. Rivette all these years, and it would not be the first time."
1,"With the simplest of means, the director Jacques Rivette has cut a path to the heart of Balzac's The Duchess of Langeais."
1,"The gorgeous floorboards creak -- loudly -- in the veteran French director Jacques Rivette's fascinating drawing-room war of the sexes, The Duchess of Langeais."
1,The Duchess of Langeais contemplates an especially crazy case of l'amour fou.
0,"The Duchess of Languor might be more evocative. Faithfully lifted from the pages of Honore de Balzac, Jacques Rivette's overlong, resplendently decorative drama takes on the phlegmatic air of its character."
1,One of Rivette's most accessible films.
0,Exquisite void.
1,"Handsomely produced and featuring fine performances, the film will travel well to festivals and art houses where audiences respond to classy period pieces with a modern sensibility."
1,"After more than 50 years of idiosyncratic filmmaking, Rivette, who turns 80 on Saturday, is as intense and rigorous an artist as ever."
1,"In Jacques Rivette's remarkable The Duchess of Langeais, romantic devotion becomes a perverse kind of warfare, in which a lover who admits that he's in love loses the campaign."
1,"A study in 19th-century European extremes, The Duchess of Langeais may put you off at first, but its playful tone could just as easily leave you pleasantly exhausted."
1,"The movie's satisfactions are subtle, but they run deep, and there are many."
0,"The Duchess of Langeais benefits from many New Wave innovations -- long, fluid takes and loosely organized improvisational scenes. Still, it feels like a curiously static entertainment."
0,The film's a minuet fetishistically repeated until either the audience or the lovers go crazy. I'd say it was a tie.
1,"Based on a Balzac story, Rivette's Duchess manages to be both old-fashioned in its settings and circumstances, and coolly modern in its view of thwarted passion and despair."
1,"It is the ultimate in movie as pane of glass, completely un-self-conscious of its own movieness but simply an intensely focused examination of human behavior on a narrative armature."
1,"Jacques Rivette's Duchess of Langeais seems to me a nearly impeccable work of art -- beautiful, true, profound."
0,"Classy? Yes,"
1,"The director guides the viewer through a sly consideration of near-sociopathic not-quite-lovers, one of whom finds refuge in religion, the other in romantic obsession."
1,"The everyday moviegoer will find it as impenetrable as its heroine. But if you vibrate to nuances of style, if you enjoy tension gathering strength beneath terrible restraint, if you admire great acting, then you will."
1,"Maybe even Rivette himself is a little too delicate for this ferocious, intensely focused pair. But he's fascinated by them, and ultimately, he loves them."
0,It's charged with nuance yet ultimately an exercise in compressed literary adaptation.

0,[Director Nic] Balthazar's determination to draw a positive message from a negative situation doesn't quite fit.
1,"What leads off like a docudrama of the social ills accompanying a misunderstood condition merges into fantasy until, in very clever ways, director Nic Balthazar turns the medium into the message."
1,"It's not the overarching naturalism of the performance that stands out but the conceptual breakdown of the portrayal into smaller, loosely connected segments."
0,It is based on a successful play and has won festival awards. But its convoluted plot and an ending which we are not sure is real or fantasy prevent it striking home as well as it might.
0,"This ""issue"" movie from Belgian director Nic Balthazar throws a dramatic feint so improbable one can almost see a cartoon question mark floating above the audience's heads."
0,It's a promising idea that hits the skids.
0,"The next it has cast all narrative sense to the winds as it grabs desperately at a triumphant (even feel-good) ending. So much good work, undone at a stroke."
0,Ben X is about nothing and nothing.
0,"The film's moral, technological and psychological themes are glazed over, and the manner in which Ben finally conquers his personal demons is laughably overblown."
1,The best movie I've seen about teen angst since Donnie Darko comes from Belgium?
0,"There's not a moment of warmth or ease in Ben X, Nic Balthazar's punishingly cacophonous debut."
1,"A provocative, exultant stunner."
0,"The film is harrowing, if maybe a bit melodramatic, until it crashes and burns in a feel-good ending."
0,"In adapting his novel and subsequent stage play, first-time writer-director Nic Balthazar seems more intent on impressing World of Warcraft gamers than honestly exploring the inner life of the mildly autistic boy at the center of his story."

0,Neither the location-based verisimilitude of Ridley Scott's shooting style nor the estimable Middle East expertise of source-material author David Ignatius can disguise Body of Lies as anything other than the contrived phony-baloney it is.
1,"DiCaprio gives the role plenty of brio, while Crowe -- who reportedly gained 50 pounds to play the morally and physically sloven office spook -- is agreeably obnoxious."
1,"Smart and tightly drawn; it has a throat-gripping urgency and some serious insights, and Scott has a greater command of space and a more explicit way with violence than most thriller directors."
0,"Working from a screenplay by William Monahan, Scott takes rusty '80s clich챕s from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/11 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are."
1,"Each character thinks that what he's doing is the right course for the greater good. But when you break down Body of Lies to its most fundamental elements, it's really about disagreeing with your boss."
0,"Body of Lies is yet another in a long, tiresome line of loud, violent, nauseating and incoherent riffs on how mercenary and inhuman the spooks in the C.I.A. are, even to each other."
1,
1,"Body of Lies is most alive while relishing the surveillance and communications tools abused by Hoffman, tools that supply him military intelligence, but not the smarts or scruples to effectively use it."
1,"Body of Lies clicks along at an engaging pace, legibly limning its multitude of characters and even throwing in a good bit of wry humor."
1,"It's solid filmmaking that, bafflingly, leaves little to talk about on the way home."
1,A passable Friday night flick.
1,"Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible."
1,"It's no surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe are so good in Body of Lies, Ridley Scott's thrilling film about the war on terror, its costs and its frustrations."
1,"Its chief bid at seriousness, a confrontational colloquy with the top terrorist near the end of the film, comes across as the awkward regurgitation of a hastily swallowed subscription to The Economist."
0,"It's a study in semisimilitude, more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings."
1,"The plot occasionally becomes convoluted and murky, but when it trains its focus on matters of treachery and intrigue, Body of Lies is exciting and compelling."
0,"Body of Lies is more than anything a missed opportunity -- or perhaps, given its cellular phoniness, a series of missed connections."
0,I'm still waiting for the war-on-terror thriller that has more on its mind than the threat al-Qaida poses to movie stars.
0,"This makes for a movie experience in which the viewer sits patiently for about 45 minutes waiting for the story to kick in, only to realize, oh. So this is it."
0,"Body of Lies is excessively intricate and extremely dull, the latest example of a filmmaker giving us a disjointed, overlong movie that's unnecessarily confusing to follow."
1,"For those who care about there being more to a thriller than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences, Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of truth."
1,"Body of Lies is a riddle wrapped in an enigma served with a side of mystery meat. It's very watchable, with some entertaining action beats, kind of a Syriania as scripted by Tom Clancy, a The Kingdom with a little less C.S.I."
0,"It's a little bit of Syriana, a lot of Traitor -- and an awful lot of scenes of people cursing into cell phones."
0,"Body of Lies is being hailed in some quarters as a 'new' kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue, it's nothing of the sort."
1,"The movie isn't witty or memorable, but it keeps you on edge, and it's the first war-on-terror film to weave its anti-U.S. politics so deeply into the narrative that the characters don't need to speechify."
0,"Art may be imitating life, but it sure makes for dull movies. Body of Lies is the latest example of what a crutch this has become -- show grainy satellite images, cut to a chase in a crowded bazaar, discuss 'intel'. Repeat."
0,Body of Lies has its share of exciting moments -- Scott remains a master at directing physical action -- and it certainly couldn't be more timely. But it's also a safe and predictable movie about a subject that is neither.
0,"As the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention."
1,On this basic premise builds a complicated story plied with onion layers of perspective and cunning.
1,"Russell Crowe's portrayal of an overweight, amoral CIA honcho in the Middle East thriller Body of Lies is mesmerizing, chilling, disturbing to the bone and one of the best performances of the year."
1,Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results.
0,"As a movie seeking to tell a story, Body of Lies is a confused jumble."
0,"This is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative."
1,The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between Syriana and the Bourne movies.
0,"Some show is made of plunging the viewer into a dense cloud of moral ambiguity, but this is mostly smoke and mirrors: while the American heroes may employ some dubious tactics, the justice of their cause is never in doubt."
0,"Mr. Scott's professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity."
0,What begins as a movie suggesting the moral complexity of counterterrorism ends up feeling very much like a thriller as generic as its title.
0,A high-priced potboiler that never comes to a boil.
1,"A respectable second-rank thriller -- intelligent but muddled, action-packed but thoughtful."
1,"DiCaprio's solid, though I wonder if a real CIA agent could get away with looking so earnest every second. Crowe has the right idea, in addition to all the fun: Just throw it away, throw it away and pretty soon you build yourself a clever characterization"
0,"Body of Lies has nothing to say about geopolitics, the action scenes are formulaic, and DiCaprio is rarely on the screen with Crowe, who coasts through the most puzzling performance of his career."
0,"Yes, there are a couple of chase scenes, but Scott rarely shifts into high gear."
1,"Good solid far-fetched multiplex action-adventure fare in the Bondian mode, with awe-inspiring technology and just enough moral philosophizing laced through it to give the mind a little something to chew on."
0,Just because it's really dense and layered doesn't mean it's good.
1,A complicated movie about the war on terror with two terrific performances and a terrific director.
1,"Perhaps Scott's ever-restless shooting style doesn't quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative, yet it's still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics."
1,"But despite the immaculate production values, the satire is so unspeakably crude that it ceases to matter. A shame. Scott has been an instrumental director in the Hollywood evolution of war films. But Body of Lies is a one-note rant."
0,"Body of Lies is big and bombastic, confused and irritable - a 20th-century blockbuster struggling to adapt (too little, too late) to a 21st-century terrain."
0,"Scott, at heart, is a pyrotechnician rather than a political philosopher. Sometimes, during the scenes when he shows graphic acts of torture, he seems like a two-penny shock merchant, too."
0,"Visually the film is so undistinguished it may be time for the maker of Blade Runner to be subjected to that film's Voigt-Kampff test, to determine whether the current owner of the name ""Ridley Scott"" is real or a replicant."
0,"But it's something of a penance to sit through, a token handwringing over American dirty tricks that's just another opportunity for Scott and co to blow stuff up."
1,Body of Lies can't quite make up its mind whether to be an all-out thriller or a savvy political drama with something relevant to say about Muslim fundamentalism and the American response to it.

0,"This middlebrow tone poem aims for ambiguity but often veers into soporific, suspending answers (and often, viewer interest) en route to an ending that explains all."
0,"The film is a little too influenced by M. Night Shyamalan, which might be the wrong way to go given the reaction to his recent films."
0,"In addition to aspiring to be a sensitive portrait of emotional healing, it's also a supernatural mystery, a romantic comedy, a family weepy and a corporate conspiracy drama. One plot might have satisfied audiences; fractions won't."
0,"The actors make a noble effort, but Passengers turns out to be just another dud in the genre of revisionist mysteries that have been messing with our heads since Haley Joel Osment saw dead people."
0,The biggest shock (aside from seeing how arbitrarily movies are chosen for theatrical release) is provided by an intrusively blown newspaper.
0,Did Hathaway know when she signed to this that it would be released just in time to embarrass her during her accolades for Rachel Getting Married?
0,Passengers is a supernatural thriller so mechanically inept and lacking in suspense that it doesn't even pass muster as lowbrow Halloween-ready entertainment.
1,The surprise ending isn't as shocking as those of Jacob's Ladder or The Sixth Sense -- two stellar examples of the genre -- but it's still dramatically potent.
0,It's a long ride to a familiar destination.
0,"It is dark, depressing and seems to be built entirely around a twist ending that feels less like a surprise and more like relief."
0,"Even though Anne Hathaway is good, it's no reason to get really emotionally invested in her quest"
0,"As my idol Joe Bob Briggs used to say, that's an awful lot of plot getting in the way of the story."
1,"Zak Penn's The Grand is a seesaw, but the setting -- the high-stakes poker subculture -- is remarkably fertile and the actors are a treat."
1,"Put Herzog at the same table as Hines, Harrelson, Parnell, Cross, and Farina, and poker on film starts to look a lot less dull. Imagine what they could do with Monopoly."
0,"Penn only wanted to create his world, not explore it, and failing that he axes the players as quickly as possible as though he's bored and ready for the credits"
0,Too much of The Grand is eaten up by thin conceits that go nowhere.
0,"The Grand lacks any sort of urgency or inner propulsiveness; the actors do their little goofs, then hand them off to the next, lending the jest the frolicking but ultimately monotonous quality of a game of tag."
1,"The Grand is in the grand tradition of Christopher Guest 'mockumentary' comedy satires: Its greatest asset is its eclectic, quirky-funny cast."
1,"Even if you know nothing at all about the game, you'd be hard-pressed to find better entertainment for such a modest entry fee."
1,"The 'card flick' has usually been a standard western, drama or crime deal -- that is, until a pack of mostly veteran comic actors tried their hand at improvising, Christopher Guest-style, in the highly amusing The Grand."
0,"This failure of steely intention, combined with a not quite satisfactory resolution of the fates of the characters, keeps the movie just shy of being a first-rate comedy."
0,"The sort of half-baked vanity project favored by the Tribeca Film Festival, Zak Penn's The Grand features a slew of recognizable faces in a fitfully funny improvised comedy."
0,There's a lot of material there in the poker world that is ripe for satire but it misses the boat here almost always.
0,"It's obvious that The Grand's director, Zak Penn, set out to make the Best in Show of high-stakes poker, but to raise the ante, he piles up the absurdities and zany backstories."
0,"It's hard to believe that a lineup so stellar could generate so few laughs, but there it is."
1,"There may be too many cooks here, too many TV stars trying to make an impression in a relatively high-profile independent film, but they connect just often enough to leave you smiling."
0,"You eventually get the feeling that the actors are riffing mainly for each other. Their attitude is, 'We're talented, trust us, we know how to be funny,' but in the end, it's mostly just a bluff."
0,"Just showing us what ex-sitcom stars and Bavarian directors do in their spare time isn't quite enough to justify The Grand, which does for poker what Best in Show did for dogs while completely avoiding any jokes about poker-playing canines."
1,The movie benefits from unpretentiousness; it never takes itself too seriously.
0,It's surprising the film doesn't feature lesbians jumping on trampolines.
0,"If you liked Rocky Balboa you should be in good shape, since it's exactly the same movie, just aimed at a teeny-tiny-bit younger demographic and with an affectless leading man who avoids hambone acting by not acting at all."
1,[Adam] Carolla's gangling charm and improv rhythms nicely loosen up helmer Charles Herman-Wurmfeld's studied setups without ever deviating from the story's solid underlying structure.
1,"Like the boxer himself, the flick is flabby but light on its feet, ultimately exceeding expectations"
1,"It's no classic, but, unlike recent attempts at sports comedy (we're looking at you, Semi-Pro), The Hammer comes through by not seeming to try too hard."
1,"The Hammer isn't going to sneak past Raging Bull in the boxing-movie pantheon (or even Rocky, for that matter). But like its star, it is an underdog you can root for."
1,"Working with utterly predictable material, screenwriter Kevin Hench finds plenty of offbeat humor, and Carolla knows how to make it sing."
1,"I never would have guessed that Adam Carolla, the politically incorrect radio and TV personality, could hold his own in a movie, but here's The Hammer to prove me wrong."
0,"A nearly comatose comedy that spends its time just bum-stumbling along, never putting in the work necessary to land a solid joke or develop a winning character."
1,"[Adam] Carolla's grumbly, monotoned, stoop-shouldered pessimism in The Hammer, the first feature he has penned, is actually funny."
1,"So many movies these days are overworked or overblown: The Hammer feels genuinely tossed-off. It isn't a great movie, or even a consistently good one. Yet it gets to elusive feelings about failure and success, hope and mortality."
1,"Carolla has a tendency to riff when he should be acting, and the whole project is rambling and disorganized. At the same time, though, The Hammer also has dry wit and unforced working-class swagger, and hits some surprising emotional notes."
1,"The script depends heavily on familiar stand-up comedy bits, but it's full of sharp wisecracks and slacker charm."
1,I think it's a terrific little film.
1,"Much of the film's charm comes from its scruffy, self-effacing modesty; it's a relaxed, affable underdog about a relaxed, affable underdog."
1,"Yes, this comedy about a sad-sack, has-been boxer is painfully predictable and manages to include every cliche of the genre, but executive producer and star Adam Carolla keeps it rolling along with his trademark, deadpan rants."
0,"The epitome of gutless, derivative hackwork."
0,"Asian horror remakes are typically not screened for critics, and Shutter is no exception. The studios know what they have: watered-down, lifeless shells of motion pictures devoid of characters, drama, or anything remotely resembling horror."
0,"A blandly cast and crafted remake of the same-titled 2004 Thai pic that itself emulated J-horror norms, which seemed a lot fresher back then. Low on real scares, atmosphere and character."
0,"Strictly perfunctory in its concept and execution, Shutter presents the usual series of spooky images of a deadpan female ghost showing up at odd times and moving in the slow, jerky movements that are de rigueur for the genre."
0,"The director, Masayuki Ochiai, conjures textbook J-horror miasma: clammy clinical interiors; overcast skies; diffuse cityscapes."
0,"Shutter coughs up another vengeful ghost in the form of a spurned Japanese waif who appears in photographs and sets about getting her message across as many ghosts do -- in the most indirect, passive-aggressive, logic-defying way imaginable"
0,"With Shutter, that nerve-tingling soundtrack gets heavy use almost from the beginning of the movie. It becomes tiresome."
0,Shutter is seriously short on shudders.
0,"At some point in Shutter you will probably lose count, along with your patience, but the film will keep right on going."
1,"Though a presentation of 20th Century Fox, Shutter has the look and feel of a proper J-horror film."
0,"If Shutter is any indication, the reputation of professional photographers is still on the wane. Not only are photographs creepy, the film suggests, but so are photographers."
0,Will the next terror-minded remake involve a possessed telegraph machine or a grudge-minded ox and cart? Neither option could be any lamer than the shock-free Shutter.
0,
0,"Clawing away under its 3D dinge and slick but desensitising effects, the movie is deadly, even when it's cool - a comic-book adaptation ruthlessly shorn of the word ""comic""."
0,Doesn't have a prayer.
0,"Not exactly an unholy mess, but still a rather too pious retread of classic sci-fi/action/horror riffs that lacks originality or pizzazz."
0,"Did Paul Bettany know, when he donned the cowl of the albino monk in 'The Da Vinci Code', that he would soon be typecast as Hollywood's go-to guy for God-bothering multiplex action movies?"
0,"Too good-looking to be dismissed entirely, not bad enough to be worthy of outright scorn, but not good enough to watch, either."
0,"The film, based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels, has nice, washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles, but there's nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice."
0,"The whole thing -- which in less than an hour-and-a-half manages to insult Catholics, Native Americans, John Wayne fans and anybody with two I.Q. points to spare -- all climaxes in a lot of fire and smoke and CGI explosions."
0,The film is somehow a disappointing combo of too-full and oddly empty.
0,"When you watch Bettany, you can't help wondering why the hell a talented actor is stuck in such an ungodly mess."
1,"[If] you're looking for a diverting sci-fi actioner that handily mixes the DNA of several different movies, with a few flying crosses thrown in and a heavy dose of Western mythology, sink your teeth in."
0,"Adapted from a graphic-novel series (and what isn't these days?), this unholy mess of horror and Western clichs is, at least, blessed with a wonderfully loony premise."
0,"The simplistic directness of its storytelling is refreshing. It's as if the filmmakers realize they're wasting everyone's time, so they at least want to take up as little of it as possible."
0,"High production values and slick editing can't save this picture. Nor does its overbearing soundtrack music, which tries to strong-arm viewers into believing they're watching a pulse-pounding thriller."
0,A mash-up of vampire horror and period westerns stewed with Blade Runner cityscapes and ridiculous religious images in a bubbling cauldron of dumb ideas and sinfully bad dialogue.
0,"""Priest'' is based on a series of Korean graphic novels. What it's really based on, though, is other movies - a whole lot of other movies."
0,The God of Aborted Franchises will be pleased.
0,"Bettany is a great actor who does melancholy very well, he also has a sense of mischief. It would be nice to see it shine a bit before it, too, fades to grey."
0,"Its visual style veers between bleached desert tones and slimy undercover dankness, but the 3D version is undistinguished."
1,"A brooding, atmospheric exercise in upscale psychological horror."
0,"Fleeting pleasures are undermined by an inane, directionless narrative, barely-even-one-dimensional characters and an overall sense of superficiality."
0,The tedium is almost as annoying as the sound effects.
0,"The Brken is interesting and confident in some ways, though laden down with unfinished moods, images, ideas - and a few scary-movie cliches. It looks like a short film pumped up to feature length."
0,Pompous and dour attempt at a psychological horror movie.
1,"With a nod and a wink to Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock he has created a slick, supernatural thriller set in a cold and disquietingly quiet contemporary London."
0,A Babel cast in a piece of free-associative gothic babble.
0,"This unbelievably ponderous British chiller keeps priming us for some shocking revelations - oodles of ""scary"" incidental music, ominous shots of the London skyline - and signally fails to deliver them."
1,Here is a film from a director with a little more imagination and skill than story-telling sense.
1,"The Brken may offer a somewhat derivative resolution, but it gets there via an aptly fractured narrative, intertwining two radically different kinds of story type to disorienting effect."
0,
0,"All of this mayhem keeps us watching, but it would be hard to describe the experience as pleasurable."
1,"[Star Brian] Cox calmly registers ranges of steely determination, fatherly care and regret-filled sadness with great authority."
0,About as plausible as platform 9 3/4 for the Hogwarts Express.
1,"The prison escape movie -- a tired genre -- gets some fresh energy in The Escapist, a compelling, carefully written and totally gripping film from the U.K. that is acted with naturalism and conviction by a smashing cast."
1,"A taut thriller that ends on a note of unexpected grace, the British prison drama The Escapist marks the impressive feature debut for director/co-writer Rupert Wyatt."
0,"The splintered viewpoints help with the monotony, but from the taunting of new inmates to the cell-block sadist, we've gone through all this before, right down to the final twists."
0,"Too much of this movie about prison feels only like a movie about prison, with actors posing and directors getting poetic."
1,Shapes a standard prison-break drama into a metaphysical study of freedom and reparation.
1,"The movie was written specifically for Brian Cox, and it's a great fit."
1,This is down and dirty and raw.
0,I hate criticising someone for ambition but The Escapist is a victory of ambition over dramatic achievement.
1,
1,"Sympathetic, genial and exceedingly wholesome, it's a film that, once seen, will permanently and favorably influence the way viewers regard the characters' real-life counterparts."
1,"The immigrant experience has been seen many times on film before but rarely with the authenticity, wit and intelligence of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's Sugar."
1,"Rich in texture and colour, music and aura."
1,"This is a sports drama of total originality, as well as the most authentic inside view of the immigrant experience the movies have given us in quite a while."
1,"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have transformed some of the saggiest, most clich챕d genres with smarts, non-screechy politics, superb acting, and visual beauty."
1,"It's a beautifully made film about a young man's journey of self-discovery, about how Miguel ""Sugar"" Santos makes his way in the world and tries to figure out, as we all do, who he is meant to be."
1,"It is both sad and hopeful, but the film's sorrow and its optimism arise from its rarest and most thrilling quality, which is its deep and humane honesty."
1,Boden and Fleck are exceptional talents who refuse to sweeten Sugar for mass consumption. The result is raw and riveting.
1,A quietly surprising drama.
1,"Think of it as a subtle arthouse antidote to the groaning galaxy of baseball movies, a film more concerned with character, mood, and capturing a highly specific cultural milieu than with big games that invariably come down to the very last inning."
1,"The most remarkable thing Sugar does is give American viewers a sense of how our country must seem to a newly arrived immigrant, without caricaturing or condescending to either guest or host."
0,Let down by a manipulative script recycled from dozens of sports and immigrant movies. At least it dispenses with a Hollywood ending.
1,A thoughtful drama about guys who have a moment in the big time before returning home to an odd reflected glory.
1,Sugar is an inside-the-park homer.
1,"A moving, surprising and provocative baseball flick that rises immediately to No. 1 with a bullet on my personal list."
1,Fleck and Boden are clearly storytellers.
1,It's got an authenticity that most sports films lack.
1,"In its unhurried fashion, Sugar can take its place with the best baseball movies. Where most focus on the grand slam, this one's about the life that surrounds the game and everything that comes after."
1,Scenes that would usually be mere setup ... become engaging in their own right. ... game and practice sequences have an easy authenticity from the start.
1,"Sugar is a gripping look at the immigrant experience, with small moments as important -- and visually arresting -- as any on the baseball diamond."
0,This Sugar doesn't blend the sweet with the bittersweet as deftly as it might have.
1,"Easily one of the year's best, Sugar is an intelligent and sublimely moving film that should not be missed."
1,"Algenis Perez Soto plays the character so openly, so naturally, that an interesting thing happens: Baseball is only the backdrop, not the subject. This is a wonderful film."
1,"The film's strength is reportorial, sensitively exploring a theme that has grown ever more prominent with the globalization of sport."
1,"This is a drama of shifting values and compromised ideals, arriving at a view of life that's wise, complicated, and tinged with melancholy."
1,Sugar is a departure from movies of its kind in quietly observing that life is often a series of base hits rather than grand-slam homers. The film has few moments of high drama and the games played matter only in how they shape Soto's character.
1,A sports movie that transcends its genre.
1,Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's film is a modest but masterful triumph.
1,"With the moving, absorbing drama Sugar, Boden and Fleck not only avoid the sophomore slump, they demolish it, delivering a film of rare intelligence, beauty and compassion."
1,"This is a film that finds certain purity in disillusionment and freedom in failure. Which may not be sweet, but it is tasty."
1,"A terrific film that's not just for sports fans. Written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, it's as insightful as it is entertaining."
1,"In 'Sugar', the pair skilfully dismantle the timeworn themes, characters and story patterns of the conventional sports movie and then reassemble them as a rich, socially astute realist drama."
1,"As a sports movie the film perhaps lacks the pace and punch to capture the genre's traditional audience. But Sugar is much more than a sports movie. It is a picture of integrity, intelligence and empathy that studiously avoids clich챕."
1,"Sugar is a revelation, not least in the way it ducks an onrush of cliche to expose the whole rags-to-riches mantra as a bright and shining lie."
1,"Sugar, winningly played by the complete newcomer Soto, isn't a cut-out ingenu but a testy, competitive, driven but fallible person. The road he follows is modest, but the film is beautiful and searching in letting him find it for himself."
1,"Poignant and beautifully written, directed and performed, Sugar confirms Boden and Fleck as eloquent chroniclers of the underbelly of the American dream."
1,"Sugar is dazzlingly free of message creep. We are perplexed, yet fully persuaded."
1,The story's slow-burn never quite flares into dramatic wildfire.
1,"Sugar, a baseball movie, an immigrant parable and a thoroughly entertaining drama that accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of putting a fresh face on the fractured American Dream."
1,"Not only have director-writers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck crafted a poignant immigrant tale, they've made a sports saga rife with rare truths."
0,"The camera is on Sugar the whole time, but the faux-documentary approach keeps him out of reach in all the ways that really matter."
1,"To tell you what happens to him from here would be a tremendous disservice. We'll just say that, refreshingly, nothing about it is sickly sweet."
1,A rich and moving reminder of the way professional sports aspirations can shape someone's destiny in the real world.
0,This is a tragic sports movie that shies away from every element of tragedy.
1,"As the film plays out its melancholy story, we realize that what we are watching is far rarer than the usual sports flick."
1,"An exceedingly odd meeting of the minds (and bodies) occurs in Quid Pro Quo, a strikingly original and provocative first feature from scribe-helmer Carlos Brooks."
1,The first half of Quid Pro Quo is among the most jaw-dropping things I've ever seen: Who knew there was a closeted subculture of people pretending to be paraplegics?
1,"It certainly won't be everyone's cup of breakfast bitters, but you can't dismiss it nonchalantly."
1,"Quid Pro Quo is a respectable feature-film debut for Mr. Brooks, and it remains reasonably thought-provoking without ever becoming emotionally absorbing."
0,"Farmiga is captivating, Stahl less so -- although a bigger problem is writer/director Carlos Brooks's script, which sets up one story, then shifts gears into something more personal and psychologically specific."
0,"[Director] Brooks plunges into the thick of a largely unfamiliar subculture in Quid Pro Quo, but the journey involves a series of well-telegraphed twists and turns."
1,"A finely observed, compelling drama with the creepy tinge of a thriller."
0,Quid Pro Quo hovers in a noir-shaded twilight zone where repressed memories and guilt merge in an obsession with physical and emotional paralysis.
1,The movie exerts a certain appeal without ever being convincing.
1,This warped masochistic cousin to David Cronenberg's Crash - not to be confused with the Oscar winner of the same name -- is well worth seeing for Farmiga's stunning performance.
0,"While a good director can spin a worthy movie from any subject, first-timer Carlos Brooks does surprisingly little with the jaw-dropper of a topic he chose."
0,"If you were a fan of David Cronenberg's Crash, you might just be the target audience for Quid Pro Quo, a perverse psychological drama about able-bodied people who yearn to become disabled."
1,The film is lightest on its feet when it shakes off the Red Shoe Diaries foreboding for moments of sly irony
0,"Brooks tiptoes into territory Luis Bunuel would have frolicked in, but he does so without the master surrealist's desire to outrage and confound his viewers."
0,"Its biggest mystery is how it was financed (by Texas trillionaire and Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, no less) and selected for distribution."
0,"In fact, ""Quid Pro Quo"" is not at all funny, merely occasionally sarcastic, its plot a succession of half-baked pop-psych speculations and its dialogue a glib sampling of sub-Diablo Cody incredibility"
0,
1,"Screenwriter Stephen Susco communicates with a wisdom beyond his years, injecting moments of profound introspection, both spoken and silent."
1,"A well-made, neo-Western from Norwegian directors."
1,"It's Brian Cox's powerful but low-key performance and an abiding respect for animals that can't defend themselves that invest this simple, straightforward narrative with an understated passion that is unforgettable."
1,"This powerful, elemental drama hits all the buttons, probably to a fault, but it's helped along by fine performances all around."
0,"The lesson to be taken away from Red is that, after some killin', the only thing that can make someone feel better is a new puppy."
0,Begins promisingly and then swerves into absurdity.
1,"What makes this movie worth seeing is the acting, which is superb throughout."
1,"Along with Shotgun Stories, Felon, and a few other recent 'indie pulps,' Red is part of a wave of low-budget genre films that turn injustice into an abstract force ripping decent folk apart."
0,"Once Avery's mission assumes a Freudian dimension, the allegory loses its moral force and changes from a meditation on justice, power and inequality into a gory melodrama."
1,A final quarter sentimental streak clashes with the masochistic pleasure of watching middle America close ranks against a victim who can't even bark in his own defense.
1,An elegant and deceptively straightforward dramatic thriller.
1,This beguiling wisp of a film charms and maddens in equal measure.
1,A sobering and resonant tale.
0,"The movie has more clichd rebirths in mind, and you'll resent where it goes."
1,"Written by Amos Poe and directed with moxie by Amy Redford, it's the ultimate movie about optimism."
0,Interesting only in showing how tin-eared scriptwriting (by Amos Poe) can make 2008 New York City seem less familiar than 1952 Japan.
1,You have to see it for yourself. It is that out-of-the-depths triumphant.
0,"Some new directors often opt for minimalism in the hope that less is more. This doesn't work for Amy Redford (Robert's daughter), who transitions from actress to filmmaker with The Guitar."
0,[A] bizarre art-house equiva lent of The Bucket Lisy.
0,That the movie is easy on the eyes (Melody's fetching silhouette against those sunset river views) doesn't make it any less bogus.
0,"The Guitar is a lark, at best, but when Burrows' healing indulgence extends to taking on lovers of both sexes, its goofiness acquires a certain hedonistic charm."
1,"Director John Hillcoat has performed an admirable job of bringing Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to the screen as an intact and haunting tale, even at the cost of sacrificing color, big scenes and standard Hollywood imagery."
0,"Except for the physical aspects of this bleak odyssey by a father and son through a post-apocalyptic landscape, this long-delayed production falls dispiritingly short on every front."
1,"Fortunately, the rumourmongers were wrong -- Hillcoat's vision is forthright and brutal."
1,"The two principals are superb, and the direction is resonant in its very restraint."
1,Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career in the faithfully rendered film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's heartbreaking apocalyptic novel The Road.
1,"The Road evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers."
0,"Evocative as it is, The Road comes up short, not because it's bleak but because it's monotonous, and because McCarthy's vision is finally as inflexible as his patriarchal hero's."
1,"The movie The Road is nowhere close to its literary sire, but it's probably the best one could hope for from a movie version."
0,"Adapting a masterpiece such as The Road is a thankless task, but the film doesn't work on its own merits."
0,"What we've been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book."
1,"While the film is not as resonant as the novel, it is an honorable adaptation, capturing the essence of the bond between father and son."
0,"... what remains of 'The Road' is an honorable failure, given there was never any real hope of translating McCarthy's style-driven novel into film."
0,"In adapting this harsh, unyielding book for the screen, Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much."
1,"Hillcoat gives the film a remarkably evocative backdrop, but the drama lacks depth and dimension, and the scenes tend to blur together."
0,"The Road has the signposts of an important film, but it lacks the diversions of an inviting trip."
1,"I cannot think of another film this year that has stayed with me, its images of dread and fear -- and yes, perhaps hope -- kicking around like such a terrible dream."
1,"The Road, for all its vivid desolation, remains a curiously unmoving experience."
0,"Viggo Mortensen plays ""The Man"" (in the anonymous, Everyman sense, not in the ""Stick it to the..."" blaxploitation sense). Charlize Theron is ""Wife."" Kodi Smit-McPhee is ""The Boy."" And I'm The Audience, and I'm annoyed."
1,"Already, Hillcoat's film has divided critics on the international festival circuit. The one constant is the praise, rightly so, for Mortensen."
1,"Like McCarthy's book, The Road is dark, bleak and nightmarish but also stirring and beautiful and optimistic: As long as life remains, the movie argues, there is always hope."
1,This year's entry in the Movies You Admire and Respect but Don't Ever Want to Watch Again Sweepstakes.
1,"The most arresting aspect of The Road is just how fully the filmmakers have realized this bleak, blighted landscape of a modern society reduced to savagery."
0,"The Road possesses undeniable sweep and a grim kind of grandeur, but it ultimately plays like a zombie movie with literary pretensions."
0,"Zombieland was the same movie with laughs, but if you take away the comedy, what is left? Nothing, on a vast scale."
0,"Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning, Oprah-endorsed, post-apocalyptic survivalist prose poem... was a quick, lacerating read. John Hillcoat's literal adaptation is, by contrast, a long, dull slog."
1,"This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is intense and, yes, depressing -- and earns every minute that it rattles inside your head."
0,"Unless you're far better at walling yourself off from identification than I am, you walk out in a state of untreated shock. Rather than thinking about the movie afterward, you wait for it to wear off."
1,"My, but it's been a fine year for Armageddon."
1,"Mortensen warms the film with his presence, creating a vivid portrait of a bereft man clinging to the one thing he has left."
1,"The Road -- centered by Mortensen's typically physical but tempered performance -- is hard to watch. But it could have been much harder. Hillcoat isn't doing opera here, he's doing tragedy."
0,"This is a willfully, skillfully crafted film with insufficient heart to the task it undertakes. It never fully connects us to love amid its ruins."
1,"The Road, a tremulous heartbreaker onscreen, has successfully made the leap despite an unthinkable amount of fidelity."
1,Hillcoat gives [the postapocalypse] an unnerving solidity by focusing on the drab details of survival and linking them to the more hellish aspects of modern American life.
1,"The Road can be a tough slog, but the journey is a rewarding one."
1,"Is the film too grim? Or not grim enough? In a perverse way, I fear it's both."
1,"In this haunting portrait of America as no country for old men or young, Hillcoat -- through the artistry of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee -- carries the fire of our shared humanity and lets it burn bright and true."
1,How could anything so bleak be so promising?
1,"You hang on to yourself for dear life, resisting belief as best you can in the face of powerful acting, persuasive filmmaking and the perversely compelling certainty that nothing will turn out all right."
1,"It hits a few tinny, sentimental notes. Still, I admire the craft and conviction of this film, and I was impressed enough by the look and the performances to recommend that you see it."
1,"What's unnerving is that the end of the world was shot on location. Apparently, if you want to see doom, just go to New Orleans or Pittsburgh."
0,"Hillcoat certainly provides the requisite seriousness, but what the movie lacks is an underlying sense of innocence, a sense that, however far humanity has sunk, there is at least some chance of rising again."
1,"Hillcoat's movie is a resounding triumph. Stunning landscape photography sets the melancholy mood, and Nick Cave's wrenching score reinforces it. But it is the performances that ultimately hold the film together."
1,"A Trojan-horse blockbuster that promises the wham bam of apocalypse while actually delivering the quiet pain of human intimacy, The Road might just be one of the most heartfelt end-of-the-world movies yet made."
1,It is an inexpressibly painful subject and Hillcoat has brought it to the screen with great intelligence.
0,This one-note exercise in neo-medieval moodiness eventually dissolves into that perennial and most corny of Hollywood tropes: the search for redemption. A disappointment.
1,"The Road isn't flawless, it isn't quite the emotional masterpiece you want it to be, but it is both a worthy companion piece to the source material and, moreover, a dramatic slice of cinematic story telling in its own right."
1,"We come out humming the film's acting and production design, while wishing we could stop humming Nick Cave's music, which pulls out all the stops marked ""Miserere mei (popcorn version)""."
0,"The Road offers an allegory of misery and dread that is crushing, not because it denies humanistic feeling but because it defies cinemagoing pleasure. You would have to be mad - or just morbidly depressed - to recommend it to anyone."
0,"Like Mad Max on Mogadon, the film is enraptured with its own depressiveness, coming on like the worst New Year hangover you've ever had."
1,"It calls on all of one's powers of emotional endurance but it rewards the brave. It is relentless but beautiful, harrowing but tender."
0,Anyone looking for either an adventure or an engrossing rumination on life after The End will find it tough to see beyond the film's starkly rendered gloom.
1,"Avoiding all the pit falls of the bleak genre, The Road is captivating and in the end inspiring, and though not a film for everyone, a great film for any who enjoy thoughtful, artful cinema."
0,"It wasn't fascinating at all. The movie looked like it cost $500 to make, excluding actors' salaries, which were worth another $500."
1,"Galifianakis's comedy thrives on risk. In G-Force, he does the most subversive thing possible in a big budget PG picture: he plays it straight."
1,"Parents already in dread of taking their children to this 3-D kids' movie by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer will find much to appreciate, though G-Force is lots of fun all around."
0,A dispiriting primer on the low regard Hollywood has for the intelligence and curiosity of children -- and the time and money of their parents -- G-Force is an aggressively stupid entry in the family-adventure genre from Jerry Bruckheimer.
0,Just about the only folks likely to find this humdrum hybrid of Mission: Impossible and The Wind in the Willows worthy for consideration are non-discriminating pip-squeaks happy to watch rodents rappelling walls and scampering along air ducts.
0,Most depressing about G-Force is the talent wasted in the name of family entertainment.
1,"Longtime visual effects supervisor Hoyt Yeatman Jr., in his feature directing debut, displays ample credentials for action and memorable setpieces."
0,"G-Force represents an inconceivably tragic waste of a brilliant idea. Frankly, if you can't squeeze a decent movie out of talking 3-D superagent guinea pigs, you may as well throw in the towel and consider a career in insurance."
0,"A 3D ball of energy, but its furry characters are flatly run-of-the-treadmill."
1,It's more fun than it should be.
0,It will possibly be enjoyed by children of all ages.
0,Producer Bruckheimer and...director...Hoyt H. Yeatman Jr. see no stylistic difference between the frenetic derring-do of G-Force and the atmosphere of such Bruckheimer hits as Con Air or The Rock.
0,"If you know a 7-year-old who's still angry he wasn't allowed to see Transformers, G-Force is sure to make him feel better. But other than him, it's hard to say who this abrasive comedy is meant to charm."
0,"A lot of resources went into making G-Force -- a lot of talent, a lot of money, a lot of marketing -- and it doesn't have much to show for it, not even some half-way imaginative 3-D gimmickry."
0,The single most terrifying moment is hearing the world will be destroyed in 30 minutes. Therein lies the possibility that the film will drag on for another half hour.
0,"Pointing out G-Force's plot holes would be redundant; it's more hole than plot, and more videogame commercial and exhausted-old-trope clearinghouse than film."
1,The rodents carry the picture off in their little furry paws and this one is sure to entertain youngsters -- no matter how you look at it.
0,"G-Force is unlikely to keep anyone older than 10 on the edge of his seat, and the bathroom humor may annoy adults."
0,"It's the template for either a video game or a Disney theme park ride, or perhaps both."
0,"The digital hijinx aren't great. And despite a committed voice cast that includes two Oscar winners, the jokes aren't all that either."
0,"On an adult fun meter, it would rate somewhere between a parent-teacher meeting and a trip to the orthodontist to outfit your kid with braces."
0,
0,
0,"I don't think kids will find it funny, [and] their parents will find it unbearable."
0,It just didn't come together.
0,"Though the film as a whole delivers ample thrills, it does lag occasionally and is encumbered by bland voiceovers and a lack of laughs"
0,Imagine ordering a Diet Coke only to be handed a formula on a piece of paper and you have some idea of what watching G-Force is like.
0,There is a distinct pet-shop whiff coming off this weirdly soulless and not especially funny or exciting family comedy from Disney about guinea pigs.
0,"The story feels thin and faintly incoherent, the action is loud and relentless. A milder version of many other Bruckheimer films, then - which doesn't mean kids won't love it."
0,Nowhere near the originality of anything from Pixar.
0,"Maybe for today's computer-gaming sprogs, speed, violence and animation (in all senses) are enough."
0,"One or two of the ideas are actually not bad - there's a rather cute joke about a mole, for instance - but for the most part, it's like running on a wheel."
0,"Obtain a human-sized version of a hamster wheel, then spend a couple of hours scurrying around inside it, and you'll have had an experience far more varied and stimulating than what's on offer here."
0,The joke of cute animals hacking into mainframes and dodging explosions may not be enough to sustain a movie.

0,"The promising intrigue of a husband's bullheaded obsession with his wife's lover falls flat in The Other Man, directed with an indifferent hand by Richard Eyre."
0,Seldom has such great star power been marshaled in the service of a sillier movie than The Other Man.
0,
0,It hurts to see a terrific cast (including the lovely and intelligent young Irish actress Romola Garai as the couple's quietly seething daughter) squandered on such dreary filmmaking.
0,"The Other Man is self-conscious, overproduced, overacted Euro-marital hoo-ha."
0,"The screen version of Bernhard Schlink's short story The Other Man does not deliver. The secret at the heart of the film, after all the fractured narrative convolutions, is anti-climactic, and the conclusion is strained and awkward."
0,A supposedly grown-up drama like The Other Man ought to have scruples about where it plans to take you. Trickiness for its own sake is simply a cheat.
1,It's a decent adult drama that should keep you guessing.
0,"The sexual temperature remains a safe, nap-inducing 98.6."
0,"Despite the cast, which is very good, you never feel like they're really taking on a life of their own."
0,It owes its air of mystery to a piece of narrative trickery that's both obnoxiously manipulative and insultingly obvious.
0,"Despite the gimlet eye of Richard Eyre, former director of England's Royal National Theatre, and the top-echelon talents of an impressive cast, a dreary, disabled disaster called The Other Man drops dead at the starting gate."
0,"The result is B-grade cheese. The only genuine mystery, for me, is why such a fine cast signed on for such a witless movie."
0,Everyone seems as if they're going through the motions.
0,"Before long, the characters, which director Richard Eyre adapted from a Bernhard Schlink short story, cease to be people and start to become devices."
0,"Neeson, in particular, has to rumble through the movie behaving in a way consistent with the ending and comes off as far over the top in the process."
0,
0,"For all its luscious period trappings and Keira Knightley's spirited take on the title role, Saul Dibb's handsome biopic reveals little about how Georgiana Spencer Cavendish became one of 18th-century London's most celebrated and influential aristocrats."
1,Solid but distant melodrama about the flamboyant 18th century Duchess of Devonshire.
1,"He has tried to make Georgiana's quest for independence - her attempt to gain power via the media and the Whigs - just as gritty. Against the odds, he mostly succeeds."
1,Can we not just enjoy what's on the screen without being spoon-fed a specious modern analogy? Dibb and his team - especial plaudits to Michael Carlin's production design and Michael O'Connor's costumes - have worked honourably to persuade us that we can.
0,"""Banality of banalities, all is banality,"" saith the critic emerging from The Duchess as he hums the locations, wigs and furniture."
1,"There is, however, much to enjoy. The cinematography, settings and costumes are glorious. Knightley gives a nuanced and often very moving performance, although Georgiana's love affair with the politician Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) is remarkably lacking"
0,"Dibb's movie looks good, but there is something exasperatingly bland and slow-moving at all times. Unlike the heroine, he never takes much of a risk."
0,"For beneath the hype and tabloid traction, the movie is dramatically flaccid."
1,"He's also helped enormously by a mature, restrained portrayal from Knightley, a masterclass in passive aggression from Fiennes and a performance of tender seduction from Atwell."
1,"Although it skims the surface, The Duchess is an uncommonly well-crafted historical feminist tearjerker -- both anti-patriarchal and a monument to motherhood."
1,"[The filmmakers] have accomplished their goal of making the unorthodox life of the late-18th-century noblewoman Georgiana Spencer, Duchess of Devonshire, relevant to a 21st-century audience of moviegoers."
0,"Knightley does the best she can to enliven such thin Masterpiece Theatre material, but eventually, the sheer emptiness of the pageantry wears her -- and us -- out."
0,It has impeccable production values but feels like a Masterpiece Theater production of a Harlequin romance novel.
0,It looks like outtakes from the nauseating bubble-gum fantasy Marie Antoinette.
1,It's Knightley who makes The Duchess a royal treat.
1,"Knightley's wig gets bigger and bigger as the character grows more unhappy, until finally it catches fire ??leading to the potentially immortal line, ""Please put out Her Grace's hair."""
1,"The Duchess recalls Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, in that it's about bed-hopping and courtly ritual during a time of revolution."
1,"[Knightley] breathes real life into the role of Georgiana Cavendish, an 18th century aristocrat with striking parallels to another, more modern, British notable."
0,Princess Di deserves livelier revisionism.
1,Fiennes and Knightley are exceptional in their roles and Dibb proves himself ably in his first big-budget flick.
1,Knightley is up to the task. Her Georgiana is history with a human face.
0,"Things unfold as neatly, and slowly, as a minuet, but there's none of the messiness of life. And that's a shame."
0,Knightley is a paper doll around whom the movie wraps hoop skirts and 21st century victimology.
1,"Thanks to Fiennes, we come to understand the enigmatic duke as the immovable object deeply perplexed at having to contend with the unstoppable force that is his wife. It is a quietly complex performance almost beyond words."
0,"The Duchess is an overstuffed, intellectually underbaked portrait of a poor little rich girl."
0,"Nice try, but the contemporary parallels are just an empty echo."
1,It's elegantly mounted and never dull -- and always easy on the eyes.
1,"While I much liked The Duchess, this portrait feels unfinished."
1,"The Duchess is a handsome historical film, impeccably mounted, gowned, wigged and feathered."
1,"Fiennes, an actor who disappears into roles like ice in a teacup, makes the Duke a complex and almost sympathetic figure, a bulky, unappealing man whose interests are in all the wrong things."
1,Beguiling.
0,"There's nothing here to show us what a remarkable woman Georgiana was, if indeed she was at all."
1,It isn't just eye candy; there's an active intelligence behind this design.
1,"Though extravagantly pretty, The Duchess still manages to be a costume drama in which the drama survives the costumes."
1,It's easy to joke about Knightley's fondness for period dramas. But we shouldn't underestimate her ability to channel the historic and modern into one compelling figure -- or her grasp of the power of dress-up to free performance.
0,"I'm not sure why The Duchess doesn't wholly succeed, because the pieces are all there and they're very watchable."
1,"Sure, The Duchess is a lavish exercise in style over substance, but it's a well-crafted, superbly acted one."
1,This is scandal-mongering fun that also lays bare the deforming power of the male aristocracy.
0,"[Viewers] may wish to heed the marital advice Georgiana's mother offers early in the film: 'Equip yourself with patience, fortitude, and resignation.'"
0,"Knightley seems overly deliberate even in her mischief, and doesn't have Kirsten Dunst's talent for turning acting into a flirtatious game of charades."
1,"The Duchess is clearly Knightley's movie, ultimately rising or falling on her performance. She's up to the task, capturing both the charm and grace that made Georgiana so captivating."
1,"Knightley, whose glamorous reputation has outstripped her acting talents until now, is subjected to a barrage of close-ups, which could have been disastrous. Yet it isn't. In this one, she really comes of age."
0,"It's disturbingly shallow, focused so tightly on one woman's feelings of repression and loneliness that it lacks any perspective on their causes."
1,It chronicles the saga of a vibrant and forward-thinking woman hampered by the constraints of a rigid society.
1,This is a wonderful film.
1,There's something really special about Kiera Knightly in these period pieces.

0,English struggles trying to create the kind of feel-good experience that seems to come so naturally to femme helmers like Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron.
0,"These women are ready for action, but the fur never flies."
0,The Women is such an arduous patchwork of 'issues' it ends up a Frankenstein's monster of a chick flick.
0,"As much as I enjoy current actresses like Ms. Bening and Ms. Ryan even in a lost cause, I cannot recommend the latest reenactment of The Women as anything special."
0,"An ensemble this good guarantees some lively moments, but the film's outdated message seems more empowering for men."
1,"In writing this I feel like a hung jury. My final verdict on The Women: Enjoyed, not overjoyed."
0,"Is it an exaggeration to call The Women the worst movie of the year? Well, yeah, probably. But it may be the most disappointing, given all the effort that went into it."
0,"It's hard to say what's sadder, that The Women's intended audience had to wait 14 years for a film like this or that that long wait has been almost for naught."
0,The original was a tart dipped in acid; this one's a biscuit sprinkled in Splenda.
0,"It's a movie of one-shots, with the ladies staying in their flattering light, delivering their lines to someone who reacts to that clever line in the next one-shot."
0,"A big-name cast of actresses gives it a go, but everyone from Meg Ryan as the cheated-on wife to Eva Mendes as the home-wrecking perfume girl struggles with a script that resists being crowbarred into the 21st century."
0,Diane English's abysmal remake of George Cukor's 1939 femme classic will have fans of the original growing claws.
0,"The Women isn't terrible. There's too much talent here for that, even if it's displayed unevenly. But it's something that might be even worse: unnecessary, at least as long as you can rent the original."
0,A costly and bemusing disaster. Dull is too kind a word.
0,Cukor's tone and timing are missing: It's as if English has included all the boutiques but none of the bite.
0,"It is difficult to determine whether this adaptation of the old Clare Boothe Luce play, and the 1939 George Cukor film version of it, is a calculated insult to all women or just a poorly directed effort to understand the fair sex."
0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
0,"In the end, English just wants to make a nice chick flick with some sassy lines. Genuine nastiness has been eliminated, while not-very-funny banter is retained."
0,"Though aspects of the 1939 comedy seem silly and shrill now, they were at least consistently entertaining. Where the original was deliciously loopy and melodramatic fun, this one is watered-down, sappy and earnest."
0,"What was then snappy dialogue from meowing madams acting out a morality play on everything that stinks about haute society now flaccidly flaps, lost in translation from old world to new."
0,"While the actors do what they can, too many characters come off as concepts, not people."
0,"Even those who never saw Cukor's movie will feel something is missing in English's version. Yes, some of what's missing is humor and snappy dialogue, but that could be forgiven, if only some of the characters were more believable."
0,"You go, girls. Preferably as far away as possible."
0,"English has shown herself to be an adept, perceptive, and at times funny writer, but too little of that is on display here."
1,"The tried-and-true characters still strike sparks. And even if the best parts are warmed over, the dish is still great."
0,A total disaster.
0,It's not every movie that makes you wish Vin Diesel would run in and start blowing up stuff.
1,"Fourteen years in the making, The Women marks a serviceable directorial debut for English."
0,"Of all the freedoms that women have rightly earned, aping the worst of male behaviour needn't rank high among them."
0,Hopefully that audience won't be fooled by this cast's potential and the clever concept; the final product here is anything but fabulous.
0,"In spite of the casting and honorable revamps, it feels more dated than the 1939 original did for its time period."
0,It hurts especially to watch Ms. Bening and Candice Bergen (who plays Mary's mother) lend their wit and dignity to a project that has so little of its own.
1,"What a pleasure this movie is, showcasing actresses I've admired for a long time, all at the top of their form."
0,"'What do you think this is, some kind of 1930s movie?' Mary bellows at her mother at one point. If only it were."
0,"Ryan, barely refining her When Harry Met Sally persona, is a dud."
0,The movie is a work of ambivalence. Is English making fun of these women? Or is she making a pilot for Lifetime? It's hard to tell.
0,"English spent 12 years slaving to get her remake green-lighted, an astounding output of time and energy for a person to spend on a movie they don't understand."
0,It's so flat and unfunny it makes Sex and the City sound like Billy Wilder.
0,"The Women has a cast to die for - Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Candice Bergen, Carrie Fisher - in a film that dies before our eyes."
0,"Once English has wheeled on Carrie Fisher and - horror of horrors - Bette Midler in a wildly unnecessary cameo, all momentum and fun have emigrated to another planet."
0,"The funniest thing about The Women is that Mick Jagger is one of the producers. There was a knowing laugh in the theatre as his name sprang up in the opening credits -- our last chance to laugh, as it turned out, for the next two hours."
1,"Actually quite an acceptable, enjoyable midrange chick flick that hasn't quite deserved the critical drubbing it has received in the States."
0,The classic 1939 film adaptation... worth seeing again and again. This is not.
0,I love women in real life but at the movies I hated The Women.
1,"Thrilling, glamorous, richly textured and breathlessly action-packed, it is one of the best movies of the year."
0,"Overall impact is muted. Oddly, too, the film is somewhat shortchanged by its great star, Johnny Depp, who disappointingly has chosen to play Dillinger as self-consciously cool rather than earthy and gregarious."
1,"The director shoots Depp in close-ups that accentuate the actor's handsome features -- those warm, brown eyes, sharp cheekbones and soft lips -- and verge on idolatry."
0,The movie is emotionally neutered.
1,Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a grave and beautiful work of art.
0,Too much of Public Enemies feels disappointingly smaller than life.
0,Public Enemies has everything going for it except a reason and a script.
0,"Ultimately, the movie's a bust."
0,What's strangely missing from this social picture is any image of the economic misery that made Dillinger a folk hero.
0,All this docudrama grit allows for precious little dramatic juice.
1,It's movie dynamite.
1,"Anyone doubting the role ""charisma"" plays in the movies need look no further than Public Enemies, an old fashioned gangster picture built on simple star power."
0,"The fatally miscast Johnny Depp's smaller-than-life performance as the famed gangster is the central flaw in Michael Mann's disappointing, curiously uninvolving Public Enemies."
1,"Michael Mann's extraordinary Public Enemies is an unusual sort of gangster picture, a near-impressionistic recreation of the last year in the life of one of American history's most notorious bank robbers."
0,A missed opportunity to make gangster picture with flesh-and-blood characters.
0,"What's the reason to make this movie, now?"
1,"Something about Dillinger's bloody, summary death has always nagged at the public; Mann is clearly urging today's audiences to draw its own conclusions."
1,"Mann knows exactly how to pace this kind of movie, set to a veritable symphony of gunshots, and Public Enemies feels both wonderfully populated and beautifully controlled."
1,Here is a film that shrugs off the way we depend on myth to sentimentalize our outlaws.
1,Public Enemies is a good movie -- sometimes very good -- that could have been a great one.
1,"It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture."
1,"The underconceived Public Enemies suffers from that lack of drive, though Johnny Depp is so urgent and charismatic as John Dillinger, he provides enough firepower to make the film legit."
1,"Although Public Enemies does not ascend to the heights of Bonnie and Clyde or The Untouchables, it is nevertheless an effective depiction of the final months of the life of one of the United States' most infamous criminals."
1,"With Public Enemies, he has made an impressive film of great formal skill, one that inescapably has a brooding dark-night-of-the-soul quality about it."
1,"Director Michael Mann has taken the story of John Dillinger, and has made from it a drama full of dread and atmosphere, a 140-minute film that in no way seems long, that's a succession of compelling scenes, with no dead wood."
1,"More interesting than involving, Public Enemies focuses on history at the expense of the characters that lived that history. It's all story without emotional impact."
0,It's like spending an afternoon -- a long one -- at a beautifully lit wax-museum display inspired by earlier gangster movies.
1,Public Enemies is as elegant and muscular a film as one could hope for in a summer of flash and noise. Which is not to say director Michael Mann's gangster saga lacks flash and simmer.
1,"As sophisticated as it is entertaining, Public Enemies isn't the sort of film that's usually associated with the summer. But it has more than enough firepower to be a blockbuster."
1,"With its measured, team-produced screenplay by Mann, Ronan Bennett, and Ann Biderman, Public Enemies makes heavy business of the notion that Hoover ushered in an era of ethically elastic law-enforcement procedures still recognizable today."
1,"Amid the summer season of spectacle and silliness, Public Enemies appears as an oasis of adult entertainment."
1,"It might sound damning to say that the film resembles a bullet-riddled carcass just barely clinging to life, but it's exactly this ephemeral sensation, which Mann sustains for the entire two hours +, that distinguishes Public Enemies."
1,"Mann and co-screenwriters Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman faithfully adapt the Dillinger portion of Bryan Burrough's absorbing 2004 book by the same name, using the same locations where famous breakouts and shootouts occurred."
1,"Director Michael Mann mounts a technically proficient, visually enthralling crime drama anchored by the low-key but captivating performance of Johnny Depp as legendary bank robber John Dillinger."
0,"Public Enemies, despite packing thunderous rounds of ammunition, is a touch too remote."
1,"Even when Dillinger is at rest, Public Enemies exudes a nervous tension, the sense that flight is imminent."
0,Ultimately an odd blend of frustrating and satisfying.
1,"In the hands of Michael Mann the film looks great, feels deliberate, and effectively explores our culture's fascination with outlaws."
0,"It's flat and direct, and when a line or two slips out that sounds like it wants to elevate Dillinger's life into a grand theme, it's quickly hammered down."
0,Our connections with Public Enemies remain abstract. The darkness and the distance kill the fun.
1,"... as strange and exhilarating as riding the running board of John Dillinger's fast, shiny, black getaway car."
0,"The best rejoinder to Public Enemies is Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal video... It's a tommy-gun gangster fantasia with a touch of Guys and Dolls, and it's everything Public Enemies isn't."
0,"Mann excels at staging the chaotic bank jobs and bloody shootouts that were just a day at the office for Dillinger, but even at 140 minutes the movie is so dense with incident that there isn't much room for cultural comment or character development."
1,If John Dillinger had not existed... Michael Mann would have had to invent him.
1,"It's a fascinating moment in history, and Mann captures the cars, the guns and the buildings with painstaking, immersive authenticity."
0,Even the bank jobs and prison breaks feel perfunctory and enervated.
0,Questionable production values alone are not enough to sink a movie. Cinema doesn't have to look great if it has something to say. But it's not entirely clear what Public Enemies is trying to say.
1,"It's a picture with virility and confidence, and unlike Dillinger's machine-gun, which the man himself expertly takes to pieces, it never quite jams, and gets off one or two lethal rounds."
0,"What's dismaying about Public Enemies, over and beyond the unintelligibility of much of the dialogue and the sliminess of its digital sheen, is that it has no sense of why it's been made."
1,"It tills the old ground, albeit with new-style star power and Mann's signature cinematic flourishes. But Depp is unduly subdued and Mann's cape work is oversold."
1,"Like Dillinger, the film lives fast, only to die young."
1,"Public Enemies is original because everyone, outlaw and enforcer, criminal and cop, looks and behaves the same."
1,"Confusions of mood are exacerbated by some fussy camera-work - handheld jigging, switches between sepia and grainy, modern video. What it needs is the old-fashioned simplicities: a bit more black-and-white; a bit more bang bang."
1,Michael Mann may not succeed with Public Enemies but the attempt is compelling enough.
1,"I do think this is a film worth seeing, so obviously, I say see it."
0,"Some strong performances, but I expected more from this great director and stellar cast."
1,"Depp and Bale as Dillinger and the FBI agent tracking him are excellent and the film is a consistently entertaining, thoughtful and high paced ride, that Dillinger actually did the more extraordinary actions portrayed is the only way their inclusion in a"
1,"A triumph of pure cinema, Public Enemies is one of the most visually experimental films of Mann's career."
1,"Very Korean in its emotional content, while also preserving a quizzical distance that is quite French, pic is one of his lightest and most easily digestible metaphysical meals to date."
1,"Finally, he arrives at a masterfully deployed bit of third-act rug-pulling so unexpected that it may be Hong's way of saying we are all stumbling toward an uncertain horizon."
0,"The South Korean director Hong Sang-soo unleashes yet another emotionally stunted antihero in Night and Day, a rambling study of male arrested development."
1,
1,"Hong works in long, improvised scenes that seem to go nowhere, but they're so rife with sexual subtext that, even at 144 minutes, the movie never feels long."
0,A startling misfire.
1,It's the slow burn of Swinton's idiosyncratic but engrossing interpretation of this unlikely heroine that holds the movie together and provides an end result that is both affecting and teasingly different.
0,"Tilda Swinton gives a committed and courageously unsympathetic performance as the self-serving Julia, but this is a character with whom you would rather spend as little time as possible - and certainly not the endurance-testing running time."
0,"Zonca has put together an ambitious and forthright story, but Swinton's contribution looks more like an actressy impersonation than a performance, and indeed Zonca's film itself looks like a European facsimile of Americana."
0,"Unfortunately the Cassevetes-style film needed Cassavetes to make it. Zonca, essaying a pell-mell verismo, produces something resembling Gloria mugged by A Woman Under the Influence."
0,Swinton's Julia is one of those performances that goes so far in repelling audience sympathy that it comes out the other side looking almost admirable.
1,"Julia, by and large, is a tale of desperate opportunists, fugitive souls who survive by living on their wits, taking risks and making it up as they go along. It sometimes feels that a similar person is behind the camera as well as in front of it."
1,"Jeered upon its premiere at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival and only now receiving a token U.S. release, Julia demands to be reassessed and reckoned with."
1,"This overlong, lurchy homage to John Cassavetes' 1980 film Gloria is a mess, but a fascinating one, given Swinton's desperately avid performance in the title role."
1,"[Director] Zonca's merely feeding off Swinton's manic performance, which starts out tough to watch, then becomes gripping."
0,"We never get a good look at her demons, just the havoc they wreak."
0,"Picture Fargo played with no sense of comedy, and you'll get some idea of the absurdity of this drunken floozy, clicking and wobbling on high heels, often with bits of her anatomy hanging out, trying to pull off the perfect crime."
1,"Like any beautiful, heartbreaking wreck -- we can never take our eyes off Julia. Or the fierce and uncompromising actress bringing her to awful, astonishing life."
1,"Ms. Swinton doesn't have Ms. Rowlands' tenderness, but, damn, she has just about everything else you need or want."
0,"This is Zonca's second feature. His first, The Dreamlife of Angels, was extraordinary. Rent that one instead."
1,A nerve-wracking thriller with a twisty plot and startling realism.
1,"In a sense, it goes to all the places a sensitive character study might have gone, but more dramatically, convincingly and vividly."
1,"Charles Bukowski would have loved this foul-mouthed, fiery, reckless woman. Against all odds and common sense, you will, too."
1,
1,
0,"All credit to writer-director Oliver Parker for trying to broaden his CV, but Danny Huston is a terrible bore as Welles, Paz Vega continues to be incomprehensible in English, and the murky mystery plot limps along unrewardingly."
0,"On paper this must have looked a neat idea: a wildly fictionalised account of a skid-row Orson Welles, up to his neck in political skulduggery while shooting a third-rate picture in post-war Italy."
0,"Like Black Magic itself, alas, this is destined to be a forgotten curio of limited appeal."
1,"For all its flaws, it's a movie-lover's movie, and clear evidence that Parker should push himself a bit more often."
1,"Angel Heart is a thriller and a horror movie, but most of all it's an exuberant exercise in style, in which Parker and his actors have fun taking it to the limit."

0,Trashing Old Dogs is a bit like kicking a puppy. But here goes.
0,"Though no animals were harmed in the making of Old Dogs, the lead actors were defanged. But like a pair of Labradors, they have a playful rapport."
0,It is an irredeemable affair.
0,"If Old Dogs isn't the absolute worst movie either star has appeared in, it's close enough to count."
0,"Largely forgetting the kids as it subjects its stars to one humiliation after another, Old Dogs doesn't even have the courage to commit to its familiar but serviceable premise."
0,A cheesy chew-toy of a comedy about reluctant fatherhood.
1,"Predictable as the premise is, Travolta's and Williams' unpredictability makes for some chortle-worthy slapstick, less of Laurel & Hardy vintage than of Abbott & Costello swill."
0,There are some experiences no one should be subjected to even in the name of science. It may be that forced viewing of this film has been outlawed by the Geneva Convention.
0,"Insipid, predictable, broad comedy mixed with Disney Family Values makes for one exasperating sit."
0,"The movie includes an interminable scene of the men taking the wrong medications for their various boomer ailments, with weirdly horrible comedic side effects."
0,Does no one know how to film physical comedy anymore?
0,Too bad this shrilly tuned comedy doesn't demand more than clock-punching effort from everyone involved.
0,"Director Walt Becker's film goes for humor and heart, achieving neither."
0,Disposable but inoffensive.
0,"This imbecilic, mean-spirited farce, which sneers at adults, leaves you wondering: where are the Three Stooges when we really need them?"
0,"We have reached a point in our moviegoing life where the two most horrifying words a studio can mutter are ""Robin"" and ""Williams."""
0,Old Dogs does to the screen what old dogs do to the carpet. It's unfortunate that only the latter can be taken out and shot.
0,The great thing about comedy these days is that few people are making movies like Old Dogs.
0,"Unfunny and uninspired, this dog deserves to be put down."
0,"The ploy of pairing John Travolta and Robin Williams, whose salaries probably represented most of the budget, is the only pedigree Old Dogs has going for it."
0,"The timing of the comic set-ups is consistently amateurish, as if scenes were edited with hedge clippers, with the actors mugging frantically, waiting for the take to end."
0,"Only the irrepressible Luis Guzmn, stuck in a walk-on bit as the stereotypical mooching Hispanic, is able to milk this cash cow and exit with his dignity intact."
0,A total train wreck.
0,"Old Dogs is no fun whatsoever, just a collection of stale kibble."
0,Old Dogs seems to have lingered in post-production while editors struggled desperately to inject laugh cues. It obviously knows no one will find it funny without being ordered to.
0,"It's kind of a funny story. Actually it isn't. And not much in this movie is, unless you like to watch elderly dogs urinate, middle-aged movie stars overact wildly, and Seth Green get hit in the groin by a golf ball."
1,Those expecting new tricks or even vaguely inventive laughs from Old Dogs or its two waning stars should heed the obvious cliche.
0,The pickings are slim going on invisible.
0,"Most repellent is the undercurrent of homophobia, the brutal cultural stereotyping and the fact that Travolta looks like a man wearing a slightly melted rubber John Travolta Hallowe'en mask."
0,This is imbecilic hooey of the rarest breed.
0,"Which is better, a soulless life of work and striving for money, or a joyous embrace of family and kids in all their gorgeous life-affirming messiness?"
0,"Being a film critic is a wonderful job, but there are weeks when the bad film delirium strikes and we'd all be better off in straitjackets."
0,The jokes are played painfully safe and not even the fleeting presence of a few a name faces detracts from the sheer inanity of the plot and outright creepiness of the film's central pairing.
0,Both Williams and Travolta mug furiously and the kids need locking up.

1,"Surrogates stays afloat by not taking itself too seriously, but also by recognizing that a movie about robots shouldn't look as if it were made by one."
0,"Just as the dystopian world the movie portrays is arid and specious, the movie itself is a mechanical sci-fi'er absent of logic or emotions."
1,The film isn't shy about its feelings about technology - it's time to unplug. It laments a culture that medicates pain away and has its head in virtual realms.
1,"A film about robots that might find its biggest fans among Luddites, Surrogates is an intense and eerily plausible sci-fi thriller."
0,"If robots had to make a movie without human help, Surrogates is what they might come up with. All the parts are visible, but there's no soul to be found."
0,"While the notion holds promise, the execution is strictly campy and adrenaline-driven."
0,"Do the actors sound so robotic because they are playing robots well or humans badly? And did a machine write this dialogue? If so, could we please apply for an upgrade?"
1,"The film moves along so quickly, and the surrogate world look is so eerie."
0,Bruce Willis has little to do but hit his predictable marks and mouth the generic dialogue.
0,Surrogates creates a world it has little interest in exploring beyond the boundaries set by a fairly dull whodunit.
1,"The ideas probably have a bit more juice than the movie, but it's still an alert piece of entertainment."
1,Surrogates nudges the robo-thriller in an interesting direction.
1,There's enough sugar-rush energy on display to ensure it's never dull.
1,"The action scenes feel curtailed and a little cheesy, but it has a veneer of day-glo creepiness which holds the attention."
1,Surrogates bleakly satirizes our increasingly plugged-in world.
0,"Despite bumpy execution likely to have detractors yelling ""dj boo,"" Surrogates oozes possibilities."
0,"The script is by the team that gave us Catwoman and the last two Terminator movies, which tells you all you need to know."
1,"There's fun robot stuff, some good philosophical ideas, and a brief, nutty Willis-Ving Rhames reunion 15 years after Pulp Fiction."
0,"For all the inspirations, the pieces of better stories that this tale was concocted from, Surrogates never manages to be anything more than a poor substitute for the real thing."
1,One of the year's more entertaining sci-fi films.
1,"Whatever the reason, Surrogates was shielded from the eyes of critics before its opening, and that's a shame. Because, whatever its flaws, it is a good movie."
0,"If the whole point of this surrogate society is to appear as a perfectly beautiful avatar, why would Bruce Willis choose that ludicrous blond wig that looks like he plucked it off a mannequin at Boscov's?"
0,"Surrogates is entertaining and ingenious, but it settles too soon for formula."
0,"The premise for this sci-fi actioner makes sense for about four seconds, after which you begin to wonder why everyone on the planet would willingly become a shut-in, how the poor are supposed to shell out for these high-tech androids, etc."
0,Give credit to filmmaker Jonathan Mostow for keeping the movie on track; give credit to star Bruce Willis for keeping a straight face.
1,"Every sci-fi and action flick clich is crammed in here and Mostow couldn't give a damn if you've seen them all before. He might not do them better, but he'll do them well enough."
1,
0,the entire enterprise has fallen short of its muddled ambitions.
0,Add watching The Promotion to the Geneva Conventions' list of humanitarian abuses.
1,"At last, we have a completely and profoundly American movie with all the classical skills of timing, editing and character development that we associate nostalgically with some Hollywood golden age."
0,"The Promotion edges toward some pretty bleak stuff. Then it steps back and laughs, like an office slacker."
1,"Steve Conrad's wry debut takes place in an urban Chicago grocery store, in which an intimate epic of manhood unfolds."
1,"There's something appealingly modest about The Promotion. It's a sweet, human movie."
0,It's a little pat and shallow.
0,Easily the worst movie I've seen so far this year.
0,"There's still a lot to like here, but ultimately the movie reflects its hapless hero a little too well. While we're constantly rooting for it to succeed, the finish line seems forever out of reach."
1,Isn't as broad as its premise might suggest.
0,It's one of those off-balance movies that seems searching for the right tone.
1,"Think of it as a polite, tightly muzzled Clerks."
0,"By going easy on everyone, [director Conrad] turns what could have been a searing satire into a lukewarm comedy."
1,"The Promotion uses the structure of a workplace comedy to pose gentle moral and ethical questions about treating people right (or wrong), about honor and ambition, truth-telling and back-stabbing."
0,The portrayal of employment in America is too close for comfort. Or comedy...Not the stuff of lighthearted summer comedy.
1,"As a subtle expression of masculine angst, it's the timid flipside of Fight Club. As a gentle critique of the American dream's descent into empty consumerism, it's a less cutesy, less feminist Little Miss Sunshine."
0,"The directorial debut of Pursuit of Happyness writer Steve Conrad, The Promotion carries a deadpan corporate-absurd whiff of Office Space but never quite scans."
0,"The strangely paced drama/comedy never finds much of a groove. Elements of conventional madcap comedy butt against more indie-ready scenes of relationship dysfunction, and the end result is more frustrating than interesting."
1,The Promotion has more work-life truth in it than a month of The Office or Dilbert.
0,As bad as a severe case of the Mondays.
1,"This is one of the more original movies of the year, and it's the rare film that's primarily about the workplace."
1,"The Promotion works as a comedy because, in the depths of our dark hearts, we enjoy seeing the woes that beset our comic antagonists."
1,
1,"The Promotion may not be much, and you get to know that supermarket uncomfortably well by the end of the 85 minutes. But as I say: He's an interesting writer."
1,"By taking the time to make that connection with the audience, The Promotion ensures we'll forgive these guys anything -- and laugh along with them -- in their quest to advance their lots."
1,A nice little comedy about what it takes to climb the corporate ladder and the toll such actions take on the psyche of a decent individual.

1,Watching Notorious was like attending a 10-year high-school reunion and reliving the good old days when the future seemed so bright.
1,"It has terrific performances, a powerful soundtrack and eye-catching visuals."
1,A rock-solid biopic with a foolproof rise-and-fall storyline and a warmly nuanced performance by Jamal Woolard as iconic rapper Christopher Wallace.
1,"Notorious is a luridly unapologetic trip through the violence, hunger, verbal bravado, and money fever of the hip-hop world, which it views as both liberating and destructive (often for the same reasons)."
1,"Kicks off with the usual rapper braggadocio of a childhood on the cutthroat street corners, then slyly cuts to a chubby A-student nerd known as ""Chrissy-poo"" to mom Voletta."
0,"Notorious delivers nothing but clumsy filmmaking and a greatest-hits checklist, without offering insight into the man or his myth. If you don't know now...you still won't know."
1,"Notorious, a biography of the rapper Notorious B.I.G., transcends gangster-flick cliches because of the outsized talents of the artist and the actor who portrays him."
0,Just buy the records; that's the point of this infomercial anyhow.
0,It's as if the filmmakers didn't trust Woolard to carry the emotional weight of Wallace's story. They should have.
0,Feels like Biggie's Wikipedia page reformatted for the big screen.
0,"A great rapper deserves a great biopic, but B.I.G. fans will have to settle for this merely passable one."
1,"Notorious is an efficient biopic, and a celebratory exercise in nostalgia for hip-hop fans of a certain age."
1,"Even when this 'authorized' movie biography makes you long for the 'explicit' version, Woolard's tour de force finds the human details that forged an artist and lets Biggie fly."
1,"What really saves Notorious are the performances of rapper Jamal Woolard, who captures some of The Notorious B.I.G.'s playful charm, and newcomer Naturi Naughton, who dazzles early on as the fiery Lil' Kim."
1,"Notorious is a good film in many ways, but its best achievement is the casting of Jamal Woolard, a rapper named Gravy, in the title role."
0,"If there's a guide book on how to create a standard rags-to-riches music biopic, the makers of Notorious must have memorized every page."
0,"The best way to remember Biggie Smalls is to listen to ""Juicy"" or ""Things Done Changed"" or any of the virtuosic autobiographical raps in which Christopher Wallace paints his own world with more immediacy and wit than Notorious ever manages to muster."
0,"Notorious is like a piece of well-crafted bling. It looks good, and facets of it shine, but behind the gilded facade there's not much there."
1,"This tale of triumph and tragedy within hip hop's elite is intelligent, gripping and far less sensationalistic than anyone could have expected."
1,"The best thing about Notorious is its across-the-board, excellent cast, especially the soulful Woolard and Mackie's mesmerizing work as the complex Shakur."
0,"It must have been an act of great restraint for Sean Combs to resist titling this film, about Chris Wallace, his close friend turned rapper and cultural icon, The Notorious B.I.G. -- The Sean Combs Story."
1,"Notorious is surprisingly and pleasantly unflashy, a straightforward picture that makes a distinction between classiness and bling."
1,"George Tillman Jr.'s film may follow the well-worn path of many a musical biography. But spot-on casting, a light touch around the edges and affection for its subject makes this warts-and-all look at the big man with the big hits a winner."
0,"The script lets too much slide, and director George Tillman Jr. -- whose biggest films have been Soul Food and the Barbershop franchise -- abets it."
1,"Closer to Scorsese than Scarface, Notorious gives a heartfelt yet clear-eyed sendoff to the late Brooklyn rapper Christopher Wallace, aka Biggie Smalls aka the Notorious B.I.G."
1,It's unlikely there will be a better dramatization of the Biggie Smalls story than this one.
0,"Notorious obviously loves its protagonist, but the movie can't get past its own starstruck awe."
1,"Notorious has a fine time along the way, with Woolard channeling the rapper's sweetness and wit as comfortably as his pathos."
1,A vivid biopic of the larger-than-life rap star that doesn't require you be a big fan of the genre.
0,"This flick smoothes out the roughest edges, drains off the rawness and blandly retraces the narrative arc of every musical biopic since The Jazz Singer."
0,"Notorious is a game of dress-up, the Greatest Hits version of Biggie's life. But in the end, it fails to present a convincing argument of why we should care."
0,"Notorious, directed by George Tillman Jr. with a sentimental touch, seems torn."
1,"This engrossing biopic, throbbing with style and attitude, will likely add to his legend."
1,An enjoyably ridiculous entertainment about a pursy young man with mysterious sex appeal who turns the rap world on its ear.
0,"Anyone looking for a dispassionate, evenhanded account of the life of Biggie Smalls will be disappointed, perhaps even dismayed, by Notorious."
1,
0,
1,
1,"Even if we miss the thinking that went into the creation of Wallace's B.I.G.-ger-than-life alter ego, the movie's performances are exultant."
0,"The movie leaves us with the sense that, twelve years after Biggie Smalls's death, a lot of people are trying to extract whatever profit or pride they can from the chaotic life of a young man who was, as he well knew, a work in progress."
1,"If Milk set the standard for biopics in 2008, then 2009 is off to a strong start with Notorious."
1,"For a hardcore fan of his music and his life, it rings true."
0,"As mainstream hip hop becomes ever more predictable, so do the biopics about its stars."
0,"This is an MTV-friendly, slick and styled production that tells one version of a very murky story and does it with plenty of energy but little imagination."
0,"It's a dim, poorly executed, eccentrically cast film and you'd be better off seeking out Nick Broomfield's 2002 documentary Biggie and Tupac."
1,A fitfully fascinating rise-and-demise yarn that will probably leave hip-hop fans underwhelmed while also alienating middlebrow audiences hoping for an inspirational night out.
1,Now in blows the myth of the myth: a brashly entertaining biopic.
0,"This team have smoothed over the details of Biggie's rags-to-riches ascent, they haven't succeeded in making it terribly interesting."
0,"The boasts get louder, the bling shinier, but the film itself just gets increasingly monotonous."
0,"The inclusion of real-life footage and re-enacted YouTube clips is an interesting idea, but with each awkward stab at a new shooting style, Tillman Jr moves closer towards disgracing his subject with yet another hack job."
1,"There's a nice chemistry between Mac and Samuel L. Jackson in this latest variant of the road movie, which contains comedic elements but actually works better as a drama."
1,"The late Bernie Mac scores big laughs in this raucous, music-filled comedy."
1,"Jackson and Mac click. They're perfectly believable as 'funk comrades' from back in the day, polyester princes reduced to asking for the AARP discount when they hit hotels they once trashed in the best rock-star tradition."
0,"It's just another grumpy-old-men grousefest with a gooey center, like The Sunshine Boys or The Bucket List. Even its musical nostalgia comes off as more concocted than felt."
1,"Soul Men is a raucous, rambling comedy, offering some laughs, some groans and a feast for fans of the musical idioms it mocks and celebrates."
1,"It doesn't sound like the likeliest pairing, but it works surprisingly well. Samuel L. Jackson and the late Bernie Mac make a winning duo in the bawdy buddy road-trip picture Soul Men."
1,"Though this is far from Mac's most memorable work, his appealing performance will undoubtedly remind the audience how much he'll be missed."
1,Soul Men is a chance to salute these masters of mirth and music. Take it.
1,No one could accuse Soul Men of originality -- it cribs liberally from countless buddy films and road movies -- but it offers enough energy and humor to overcome its shortcomings.
1,"There are moments of comedic fire that justify the presence of the two stars in the film, and us in the theater."
1,You want a good time? Soul Men will provide it. You want to say goodbye to Bernie Mac? He wants to say goodbye to you.
1,"Soul Men is a raucous send-off for the late Bernie Mac, a gleefully profane take on the road-trip movie that earns its R rating early and often."
0,"The movie crams in myriad needless subplots -- ostensibly to provide padding, which only draws attention to how thin the original story really is."
0,"Unfortunately, [it's] not good enough to make up for the unnecessary proliferation of Viagra humor, rectal-exam jokes and comedy at the expense of women."
0,"While it's a shamelessly mediocre movie, it's not mediocre in the usual ways."
0,"Soul Men has a lot to overcome in its effort to be funny. The pall over it can be ignored only intermittently, at least for the time being."
0,The only good reason to see the otherwise dismal comedy Soul Men is to have a look at the late actor and comedian Bernie Mac in one of his final screen roles.
1,So why is this film worth seeing? Because it's an ideal showcase for Mac's peerless comic chops.
0,Soul Men casts the best possible leads in the worst possible movie.
0,We've heard this tune before.
0,"Sort of a riff on The Sunshine Boys with hints of Dreamgirls, about all Malcolm D. Lee's relentlessly crass comedy has going for it are some amusing Motown-ish numbers and the chemistry between Mac and his real-life friend Samuel L. Jackson."
1,"There's a raunchy energy to Soul Men that cannot be denied. Even if the film is derivative, predictable, visibly low-budget and crude, it's also darn funny a good deal of the time."
1,"There's nothing here you haven't seen before, but the genuine and infectious chemistry between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Mac and the irresistible energy of their performances is more than enough to give the movie real heft and momentum."
1,Mac was a magnetic performer with a long history of redeeming mediocre movies; unfortunately this is another one.
0,"Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac appear to be having a good time, and for most of this raunchy, poorly orchestrated buddy comedy, that's enough."
0,"Mac could have wished for better for his final film, but this is a picture about entertainers and damned if he isn't one"
0,"Considering the canvas the story provides, and the richness of the tradition it taps into, the amount and quality of the music is pretty disappointing."
1,"This one's only fair, but it has its low-down wiles and its moments."
1,"It is not a perfect film but it is a nice, solid reminder of how great Bernie Mac was."
0,It really is bittersweet to watch Mac in one of his final performances. He makes the most of pretty average material here.
0,Soul Men could have been so much more.

0,"With its belabored gags, misfired pop-culture references and garish visuals crammed together like so many disjointed body parts, this manic kidpic cranks up the annoy-o-meter early on and rarely lets up."
0,"Although the visuals tantalize and the actors providing the voices add a lot of sass, the result is only so-so."
0,"Igor tries to spoof Mary Shelley just as Shrek did the Brothers Grimm, but something tells us this movie's charmless hero won't make an ogre-size impression on kid audiences. Call it a hunch."
0,There's enough good stuff here that a better 'toon could have been stitched together from the many promising funny parts.
0,"A potentially original premise and an eager voice cast led by John Cusack and Molly Shannon are left to decay amid a clunky story vaguely reminiscent of Monsters, Inc. and images often resembling visuals rejected from Tim Burton's Corpse Bride."
1,"While this is no WALLE, or Ratatouille, it does bring to mind Monsters, Inc. and some of the visual flair of Burton's The Corpse Bride."
0,Even the desolate future envisioned in this summer's hit Wall-E has more immediate appeal for kids who might not be familiar with the source material for Igor.
1,"While the stitches holding together the plot are clearly visible, Igor breathes some enjoyable life into its stolen grab-bag of gimmicks."
1,"Director Tony Leondis and screenwriter Chris McKennna have mined everything from Young Frankenstein to Sleepy Hollow to Japanese anime to the German Neo-Expressionists to create that rare thing, a cartoon for adults."
0,A modest do-gooder trying to pretend that its not Cartoonland's most direct attack of the Bush administration.
0,"Igor, like the Frankenstein's monster at the centre of its tired plot, looks like something cobbled together out of used, very used, parts."
0,"While much of the banter between the characters is inventive, the plot turns are predictable - complete with a romantic misunderstanding straight out of The Karate Kid (and 20 other films)."
0,Pieced together from Tim Burton and various other sources with more desperation than inspiration.
1,"You can think of it as an animated riff on the American dream: Our fate is determined not by the accident of our birth, but our own will, intelligence and talent. And let's not forget serendipity."
0,"My kid went with it, and I had a fairly good time, as I waited for the reappearance of a marble-mouthed peasant tart, voiced by Jennifer Coolidge. Half the time her line readings are hilarious, and it's impossible to know why."
0,"To convince you that it's full of surprises, the movie throws in Louis Prima songs where they don't belong, and it riffs on classic monster-movie cliches mostly by spinning them into newly unfunny cliches."
0,"There's scant reward for sitting through Igor, an animated twist on the Frankenstein story that never sparks to life."
0,"A Frankensteinian mishmash of parts, with drawings that are derived from Tim Burton grafted onto a script filled with Shrek-style sarcasm."
1,"But there's not much form to the plot which develops in fits and starts. Nevertheless, those kids that weren't confused appeared to enjoy it, so there you go."
1,"You do feel that, with it's knowing one-liners and classic movie references, Igor is trying terribly hard to amuse an adult audience, possibly at the expense of children it should be entertaining."
1,"This film is outclassed by the Pixar stable, but it's entertaining stuff for the children."
1,"It's spirited and funny in its better moments, and gives a sly spin to the clich챕s rather than just parroting them wholesale."
0,"More well-aimed wit was needed, less grapeshot wackiness."
0,This dark-toned animation borrows its style from Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride without adding much of its own to the macabre mayhem.
0,Young children might find it a bit difficult to understand and adults too easy.
0,"I just didn't think there were anywhere close to enough laughs in this movie and that ultimately, as a comedy, is what it's got to deliver."
0,It is not visually stimulating.
1,Igor celebrates a defiantly adolescent and suitably caricatured vision of mortality with the potential to have adults and special young malcontents in stitches.
1,A fun time-killer for kids aged tween and up...

1,"PETA activists will be apoplectic, but the pic is geared to more culturally open-minded viewers unacquainted with the subtleties of the corrida, revealing that it's a primitive though complex sport, and that Fandila is an athlete with a dancer's skills."
0,"The Matador suffers from a very predictable, almost staged quality when capturing Fandila's unsequined life outside the ring."
1,"The Matador reserves judgment while raising the core issue concerning this traditional ritual: deep, poetic cultural expression or glorified animal cruelty?"
0,Mostly The Matador romanticizes a brutal tradition that has no place in the 21st century.
1,"Stripping away centuries of civilization, The Matador confronts something primal in human nature, daring us to do the same."
1,[The filmmakers] capture the paradox of beauty and cruelty that charges their entire film. The Matador is rightly exciting -- and unsettling.
1,"Half of the laughs stem from X-rated spins on famous movie titles, but a gentle, less ironic humor also occasionally pokes through."
1,"Frank Langella's note-perfect, tour-de-force turn as a man elegantly shaping his own demise is nicely counterpointed by a shambling Elliott Gould as a bird-watching private eye."
0,We're left to wonder why we're watching Gould scramble for clues to a mystery we've been given the solution to.
0,"There's a vaguely appealing elegance to the way the film moves -- that is, when the actors stop spouting laughably portentous dialogue long enough for one to appreciate the film's pacing."
0,"The Caller is a loopy, talky, 92-minute two-hander with Elliott Gould and Frank Langella (on a downward spiral following his juicy triumph in Frost/Nixon), written and directed by a force to forget called Richard Ledes."
0,"IF Frank Langella hadn't received an Oscar nomination for ""Frost/Nixon,"" it's pretty doubtful that an opaque oddity like Richard Ledes' The Caller would have managed even a one-week vanity booking at the Quad."
0,A corporate crime drama that runs fatally amok.
1,A big new talent arrives on the scene with Sin nombre. Writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga's enthralling feature debut takes viewers into a shadow world inhabited by many but noticed by very few.
1,"Whenever Sin Nombre turns violent, it seizes you with its convulsive skill, but the film's images ??vastly outstrip its imagination."
1,"The scope is epic and the achievement, though solidly grounded in conventional storytelling, is a revelation."
1,There is bitter and breathtaking truth in the story and in the story-telling.
1,"That this is Fukunaga's first film is astonishing, given its sharp script, technical proficiency and suspenseful pacing. The ensemble cast is top-notch."
1,"There are some brief minutes when the tension drops and the story starts to sag, but Fukunaga almost always fills the frame with something worth seeing, and the story has a built-in suspense."
1,"The caressing, honeyed light in Sin Nombre beautifies and softens every ugly moment in this equivocating story about geographic and moral border crossings."

1,The best film I've seen this year.
1,The combination of professional actors and locals is effective and adds to the unique telling of this immigrant story.
1,"[Director] Fukunaga has a fine, spacious film sense and a gift for action, but the doomy, heavy-handed plot devices and overwrought, overacted gangland set pieces betray a novice's hand."
1,The thrilling and beautifully crafted debut feature of 31-year-old Californian Cary Joji Fukunaga.
0,"It's the tone of the movie's two sides -- action and stillness, graphic violence and romantic melodrama -- that don't cohere."
1,"It contains risk, violence, a little romance, even fleeting moments of humor, but most of all, it sees what danger and heartbreak are involved. It is riveting from start to finish."
1,Writer-director Cary Fukunaga keeps the story lean while peppering it with realistic details.
1,"Fukunaga's gift lies not in inventing clever reversals, but in declining to provide us with the typical cinematic cues that advertise what's coming."
1,Among the film's many revelations is a cast of talented unknowns who stand to become much better known in years to come -- which makes the 'no name' title seem almost ironic.
1,More substantive than the average thriller/road movie.
1,"Tragic and gripping, Cary Fukunaga's Sin Nombre revitalizes a gang-warfare genre that had appeared to be played out lately."
1,[Director] Fukunaga's startlingly impressive first feature is almost ruthless in its depiction of the brutality and degradation confronting the hidden hordes that cross rivers and hop trains trying to get to the United States.
1,Rich details make the immigration thriller Sin Nombre vivid and haunting.
0,"As accomplished as Sin Nombre is in many ways, you're always aware of the ever-tightening plot screws, rather than the human beings caught in one threatening situation after another."
1,"It gives a caravan of migrants human faces, compelling motivations and dramatic challenges that transcend borders."
1,"Sin Nombre is at once subtle and intense, familiar but refreshing, intimate even as it tells a story untold numbers have endured."
0,Intense Spanish-language feature debut intrigues but doesn't quite gel.
1,"Brutal, wrenching and filled with desperation and meanness, Sin Nombre signals a major new talent in writer-director Cary Fukunaga, who never flinches while telling a story so grim and sad it moves beyond tears to numbness."
1,"Fukunaga paints better outside the lines, working with cinematographer Adriano Goldman to offer vivid shots of the poverty and despair cutting through Latin America."
1,Sin Nombre is pure filmmaking: a great story told in beautiful images.
1,"The actors, particularly Flores, have a documentary reality about them. Their reactions to most of their predicaments, even the ones given away too easily by the script, are real in the most human sense."
1,"It's a tribute to the visceral impact of the staging that the film retains its grip despite becoming somewhat predictable, while thematically it's the usual cycle-of-violence hand wringing."
0,"For all its formal 챕lan and gritty location shooting, Sin Nombre is a wearily hollow, morally specious movie."
0,"If you've ever got your hands on a second-hand set of Operation, you'll know how it feels to watch the latest addition to the slum drama stable. Most parts are present and correct, but there's definitely something missing - a heart, perhaps?"
1,"Likely to be one of the must-see foreign language titles of the year, opening our eyes to a world of desperation, hope and pain."
1,"The movie never quite determines if it is docudrama or melodrama, though each, at times, shines strongly."
1,"A striking, and often quite gruelling, account of survival and flight in poverty-stricken Central America."
1,"The film will linger in the mind long after its devastating conclusion. You leave the cinema breathless and disquieted but also with a sense of having had something important revealed to you. In a very strong field, this is the year's best film so far."

0,"A meandering, self-indulgent rumination on old age, death and unfulfillable desire, German actor-director Vadim Glowna's adaptation of Yasunari Kawabata's surreal, ironic short story gets everything but the surrealism and irony right."
0,One of the year's worst releases.
1,"Sure, there's copious full-frontal female nudity and an aroused male body part, but such scenes are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. There's a subtle difference, but still a difference."
0,Not even the august presence of Maximilian Schell can dispel the odor of fusty smut that clings to House of the Sleeping Beauties.
0,"Based on an acclaimed novella by Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata, the film is one of those self-consciously atmospheric literary adaptations that suffer from a surfeit of symbolism and pretentiousness."
0,"Do you find this premise anything but repugnant? It offends not only civilized members of both sexes, but even dirty old men, dramatizing as it does their dirtiness and oldness."
0,"Glowna presents this smoky German feature as an elegy for lost youth, but it's so tumescent with male self-pity that I couldn't wait for it to end."
1,"These elemental forces fuel a compelling narrative, but the second half of the movie starts to drift."
0,"There is a reverence for the idea of Laurence's book but ultimately, in spite of its spiced-up sex scenes, it's much tamer and more conventional."
1,Ellen Burstyn deserves another Oscar nomination for this compelling drama.
0,"Despite a terrific lead performance by Ellen Burstyn, Kari Skogland's epic The Stone Angel is a lesson in the perils of trying to cram a hefty Canadian novel that spans decades into a movie running just under two hours."
1,"Writer-director Kari Skogland adapts a beloved Canadian novel gracefully and with plenty of spunk, the same way its main character moves through the world from cradle to grave."
0,"Although talented newcomer Christine Horne is ideal as the younger Hagar, letting Burstyn play the character at around 50, despite best-effort lighting, was not the wisest choice."
0,A film of tightly assembled bits and pieces that don't fit comfortably together despite clever dashes of magical realism connecting past and present.
0,The only way to enjoy Kari Skogland's epic portrait of a miserable 90-year- woman named Hagar (Ellen Burstyn) is to reframe it as Scary Movie for weepies.
0,"Left me feeling respectfully indifferent, as if I'd been served a nutritious meal that was only fleetingly satisfying."
1,"A tastefully reverent, fundamentally sincere treatment of Margaret Laurence's 1964 Manitoba-based novel, a staple for Canada's 12th graders."
0,
0,What we're offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.
0,"The Squeakquel is painfully high-pitched. It reaches frequencies that could make bats plummet from the sky, clutching at their little ears in agony. It's as if a mosquito equipped with a power tool is attempting to drill its way through your eardrum."
0,"The Squeakquel is astonishingly high-pitched, like 100 helium balloons being let off in your head. A caveat, then: dogs may pick up on subtleties I've missed."
1,"The film never tries too hard to be cool, features adorable rodents in fetching knitwear, and includes helium-voiced chipmunks shaking their tushes as they cover Beyonce songs. Just great."
0,"Three digimated rodents play guitar, go to school and create merry hell, all for the benefit of the ""holiday season"" audiences that made the original Chipmunks movie a ""global phenomenon"" to the tune of 350m. That's not phenomenal - that's criminal."
1,A frenetic but undeniably funny follow-up that offers twice the number of singing-and-dancing rodents in another seamless blend of CGI and live-action elements.
0,Ross Bagdasarian's enduring characters are a bit tougher to endure in this charmless sequel.
0,"Despite its success as a babysitter for preschoolers, it's a not a very good film."
0,The earlier Alvin movie made more than $217 million just in the United States. It's hard to imagine this somewhat confused sequel doing as well.
1,Thomas brings a light campy touch as she did in 1995's The Brady Bunch Movie.
0,Little kids will love it. You'll need a hazmat suit.
1,"If the Chipmunks don't make you smile, you're nuts."
0,It seems as if no professional actors were hired in the making of this motion picture.
0,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel offers exactly two big laughs for its kiddo target audience -- one involves passing gas, the other a shot to the crotch."
0,"Being aimed at children isn't a valid excuse for a movie to be simple-minded and illogical. You know that, right?"
0,"Whatever limited charms the first version had -- mostly David Cross' portrayal of Ian, the greedy manager who exploits the furry creatures -- have since soured."
0,Will kids eat up this cutely fractious claptrap? Of course they will. They'll eat up whatever you put in front of them. But that doesn't make The Squeakquel good for them.
0,"Betty Thomas delivers pretty much the bare minimum: peppy, brightly colored, tune-filled nonsense sure to meet the low, low standards of its pre-kindergarten core audience."
1,"A surprising array of stars play the helium voiced sextet, safe in the knowledge that noone is going to be offended by this charming chipmunk squeakquel."
0,"Every time an adult ended up in traction or broke wind, the three-year-olds in the audience were freshly ecstatic."
0,"Whatever slim charms there were in the nostalgic, musically cute and slapstick-friendly first film of chipmunk mania are squished right out of The Squeakquel like so much rodent roadkill."
1,It's one that will keep little moviegoers happy without driving their parents too squirrelly.
0,"It's not entirely Thomas's fault: What are you going to do with those fat-cheeked, helium-voiced singing critters but slap together enough ""awwww"" moments to make the toddlers happy and enough knowing winks to keep parental bums in the seats?"
0,"At one point, Cross's character takes a full-frontal hit in the groin from an errant toy motorcycle."
0,"The slapstick required of everyone, animals or not, will exhaust even parents who remember the Chipmunks' original hits."
0,The whole thing is rather insipid. But Thomas makes it smoother and more palatable than it deserves to be.
0,"It's far from the most unpleasant kiddie flick I've sat through this year, although I would be misleading you if I promised you lots of laughs."
0,There are worse forms of torture.
0,"Blending CGI and live action, this ""squeakquel"" to the witless 2007 kids' film proves just how dangerous such technology is when placed in the wrong hands."
0,"They call this the ""squeakquel"" and that's about all you'll want to know about a film that remorselessly pulls all the levers of the first highly successful box-office attraction."
1,"A marvelously rich visual, intellectual and emotional experience, one that I expect will grow deeper with repeat viewings."
0,"What's troubling is its lack of perspective on anything beyond the narrow, navel-gazing concerns of its characters."
1,A Christmas Tale is a bad dream with just enough distance to give us a midwinter's night's laugh.
1,"Out of the most ordinary ingredients -- an ailing mother, estranged adult siblings, a good meal ruined by bad behavior -- the endlessly inventive French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin has made the old look fresh in A Christmas Tale."
1,"Deft, playful, fluid, haunting, and filled with the joy of filmmaking."
1,A Christmas Tale is a film experience to be seen and savored for its exquisite delineation of human feelings and foibles.
1,"Dark secrets are unlocked, words draw more blood than punches, and [director] Desplechin turns one family into a universe that resembles life as a startling work of art."
1,"It's the definition of a film meant to be admired more than loved, but Desplechin's fierce intelligence and uncompromising sense of character come through."
1,"A long, improbably funny and very beautiful film."
1,Some wry humor runs through the course of the overly long saga. But there's not enough dark wit to mitigate the tedium and pretentiousness.
1,"After two and a half hours in the thrilling, exhausting company of the characters in A Christmas Tale, the intimacy we feel with them is wired with surprise."
1,"If Ingmar Bergman and Wes Anderson some how collaborated on a movie together, I'd guess their sensibilities would yield something like Arnaud Desplechin's darkly hilarious, brilliantly acted A Christmas Tale."
1,"Wry, observant and frequently heartbreaking."
1,"These infuriating, involving individuals are so resolutely themselves, so sure they are right by their own lights, they exist in a world beyond anyone's judgment."
1,"Getting through these first 20 minutes is as necessary as plowing through the first 50 pages of a 19th century novel. Once that work is over, the movie's singular pleasures reveal themselves."
1,"Watching A Christmas Tale is like getting to know a family other than your own by leafing through its scrapbooks and laughing at its photograph albums, while it bickers in the next room over stuff you may never understand."
0,"I'd be more inclined to call this French dysfunctional family epic gabby and preeningly self-indulgent -- in a word, annoying."
1,"A Christmas Tale is long but it exerts enough of a pull that the 150 minutes pass rapidly, if not necessarily painlessly."
1,"Roiling with laughter, tears, drunken confessions, revelatory soliloquies, pain, sorrow, hospital visits, and various kinds of love, A Christmas Tale is a smart, sprawling, and sublimely entertaining feast."
1,"It's a simple picture about complicated people, the members and sometime-combatants of the extended Vuillard family."
0,"Characters occasionally address the camera, which helps disentangle the competing story lines of madness, adultery, and betrayal."
1,There are simply too many marvels to tally.
1,"To tweak Tolstoy: All happy families may be alike, but all unhappy-family movies are entertaining in their own ways."
1,"Even though it's pretentious and overlong, A Christmas Tale is still maddeningly engaging, thanks in large part to its attractive and gifted cast."
1,A strangely encompassing collection of private moments among the members of a large family with a fraught history.
1,[It] will make anyone dreading the holidays with their family grateful for what strife they may face. It's nothing compared to what the Vuillard clan gets up to.
1,"A triumph of willed optimism (or perhaps more accurately, of grudging good nature) over unhappy experiences..."
1,"Never devolves into a tedious two-and-a-half hours of self-examination. But it also never goes very far, either."
0,"You could, of course, forgive the whole enterprise as the extravagances of an intellectual fairytale, but the film's wayward eccentricities outweigh its good performances and breezy telling of a jumble of a plot."
1,The film is almost as involving as it is infuriating.
1,"The effect is strange, disconcerting - but never dull. I think what Desplechin has created is not a conventional drama, but a sort of dream-ensemble masque: a choreographed parade of ideas, emotions, personae. A film to ponder, and to savour."
0,"The cast expertly incarnates this family haunted by loss, lovelessness and (literal) bad blood, but the film's unduly protracted duration makes the Vuillards feel like Christmas guests who just will not leave."
1,"A Christmas Tale is a compelling domestic drama, a French art gem to inaugurate 2009."
1,It's maddening and it's exhilarating.
1,"Despite occasional bouts of tedium over the epic course, a surprising buoyancy emerges: Desplechin's methods begin to inform, even brighten, the message."
1,"Desplechin is an inspired impurist. His Christmas Tale is untidy, overstuffed and delicious: a genuine holiday feast."
1,"[Desplechin] has skill, patience, empathy, and insight; quickened by the holiday occasion, they make the title of his film ultimately, if unconventionally, right."
1,"It's a bracingly eccentric, waspishly intelligent blast of flashbacks, freeze frames, split screens, and bizarre music choices."
1,Perfect off-season timing for a wickedly off-kilter movie about a French family Christmas in extremis.
0,Why is a movie that's trying to evoke some of the cool metropolitanism of late-'70s Woody Allen so rammed with hoary gags about New York being awash with transvestites and homeless flashers?
0,"The romantic trials of two wealthy, good-looking people, whose only barriers to happiness are their own petty insecurities, become tedious, and it's not helped by some stilted dialogue and awkward, mannered performances."
0,"Saddling two game actors with a tone-deaf, charmless script, the film makes recent J.Lo vehicle The Back-up Plan look like Billy Wilder in comparison."
1,"After a bumpy start, Ripple Effect begins to show why Whitaker, Virginia Madsen and Minnie Driver signed on as executive producers and co-stars."
0,Several ordinarily banal movies soldered into one amazingly bad one.
0,Starts with a not-very-original insight and takes too many shortcuts delivering it.
1,"It's as handsomely shot as any film about an ace shutterbug ought to be, and Juliette Binoche infuses familiar internal crises with palpable pain and urgency."
0,I found something questionable in its forced and unearned emotional moments and the frankly rather insufferable performance from Juliette Binoche in the lead role.
0,A trick missed.
0,"Every theme and thesis is italicised. We aren't trusted to probe them with our own minds. The preaching is accompanied, for extra emphasis, by treacly sacerdotal music."
1,"The film has limitations. But it has Binoche, and that's almost enough."
1,"This is a well-observed drama, which acknowledges the war photographer's selfishness as well as her courage and single-mindedness."
1,"An affecting drama made more poignant by honest-feeling autobiographical elements, Erik Poppe's A Thousand Times Goodnight examines the choice between family and career when that career represents work of real social importance."
1,"Deftly sidestepping both melodrama and family-values messaging, Poppe imbues the film with enormous emotional resonance, brilliantly grounded by his leading lady."
0,"Poppe's closeness to the material ensures a level of passion, but he still fails to create a truly specific dynamic for Rebecca and Marcus's family ..."
0,A self-important art-house film by an ex- war photographer who lacks distance from his subject.
1,Poppe crafts some powerful scenes that pose questions not easily answered.
1,"What makes ""1,000 Times Good Night"" more than a dramatic essay on wartime journalism is Ms. Binoche's wrenchingly honest portrayal ..."
1,"""1,000 Times Good Night"" has moments of both startling violence and breathtaking beauty."
0,"Sadly, this gorgeous-looking adult movie plays out the same theme over and over, never going anywhere surprising."
1,"""1,000 Times Good Night"" takes its time, letting the pathos fully soak in. Those who are regulars at film festivals will find the pacing - and the emotional note it ends on - very familiar."
0,"A disappointingly standard-issue addiction melodrama, this one the tearful case study of an adrenaline junkie whose compulsion threatens to push her family and loved ones away."
1,Poppe can't match the stunning opener of Binoche photographing a suicide bomber in Kabul with scenes of domesticity. But Binoche never falters. She's the film's fire and grieving heart.
1,"The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful."
1,"This potent Norwegian drama by Erik Poppe, himself a veteran war photographer, opens with a gripping sequence."
1,"Poppe registers Rebecca's moral commitment as well as the compulsive aspect of her dedication but the film oscillates between drama and statement; it becomes a series of set-pieces and what-ifs, particularly towards the end."
0,"Binoche is impressive, bringing a steely, self-contained detachment to even the most intimate moments with her family. But Erik Poppe, the director, slathers the film in overly sentimental music choices"
1,"If I'm complaining about this movie a lot for one I'm deeming better than fair, it's because I was frustrated by how its first-rate ingredients, Binoche chief among them, somehow failed to create a spectacular end result."
0,"The long stretches of dead air that, it can only be assumed, were supposed to be filled by laughter provide ample time for pondering what audience Harold, T. Sean Shannon's strenuously stale comedy, was intended to find."
0,Harold is a genuine oddity that's more watchable than it sounds.
0,"There's little indication, beyond the endlessly unfunny school humiliations and fogey-dom signposts (ha ha, he uses Old Spice), that the notion of a preteen codger is worth our sympathies."
0,"Harold is the type of one-note dead zone ideally suited for a bathroom break while sitting home on a Saturday night, alone and semidrunk, in front of the television."
0,A terminally lame puberty comedy about a prematurely bald 13-year-old.
1,
0,"Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter David Boula are content to rely on the usual suspects, taking their visual and dramatic cues from other, more clever and involving sci-fi capers."
0,A confused jumble of parts in search of a whole.
0,It's an ambitious attempt to shove the whole of a fairly complex comic book universe into a single messy and garish movie.
0,"A weightless, style-driven thriller set in a photogenically chaotic Hong Kong."
1,The film is blessed with a frenetic pace that simultaneously accomplishes two things: it keeps the energy level high while obfuscating some of the most obvious logical flaws in the plot's structure.
0,Movies don't get more headache-inducing than Push.
1,"A trippy, nonstop action fest, with the feel of a really good episode of Heroes."
1,It's the perfect brain vacation for those overtaxed by Oscar-nominated movies.
1,"An ambling, broody concoction along the lines of Strange Days."
0,Not much of it makes sense. The rest isn't terribly interesting.
0,Imagine if the X-Men had spent most of their time sitting around talking about how they were going to fight Magneto instead of ever actually doing anything and you'll have a good sense of what is wrong with Push.
0,"Belle... is blank as a page, and the intended romantic chemistry between her and Evans is never in evidence."
0,"Push has vibrant cinematography and decent acting, but I'm blasted if I know what it's about."
0,"There are many problems with Push, and most are the usual boring things: unnecessary plot loops; long, dumb musical interludes; a charmless script; and ostentatious action sequences in which the only person excited is the cameraman."
0,A silly movie that is partially engrossing and plenty convoluted.
0,"Evans and 10,000 BC's Belle shuffle through a turgid romantic subplot, and though the two characters are very, very pretty, they've got the chemical spark of a banana."
0,A grubby cut-price sci-fi thriller.
0,"Just as it's getting impossible to tell the superpowered humans without a scorecard, along comes Push to muddy the waters."
0,"By the time the credits roll, your most fervent wish is to run into a 'wiper' (one who can erase memories)."
0,"Suggestive of X-Men, The Matrix and the television show Heroes, Push is one of those time-mangling thrillers that manages to seem both complicated and superficial."
0,"One long mistake from start to finish, this is a film that never gets its rhythms or bearing right."
0,"As far as I can tell, the only ability in short supply is acting."
0,"Silliness rules the day: plot holes abound and are plugged with techno-pounding action sequences and more nonsensical guff. As a TV pilot, this might have worked; as a film, it's loud, confusing and inane."
0,"""What if nothing we did made any sense. Would that throw them off the scent?"" Nick asks. You bet."
0,"In time this would-be thriller comes to rest with a fist fight, a hanging ending and the implicit promise of a sequel. Of all the calamities that Fanning predicts, Push 2 is one she missed."
0,Sci-fi hokum to give you a headache.
0,"Totally watchable, totally forgettable."
0,Push is a chase film dolled up with supernatural powers and chintzy retro design motifs.
1,"McGuigan's saving grace is a willingness to slow down and savour his own images. At best, a moody inconsequence takes over and confusion feels like part of the plan."
0,
0,
1,"The stuff that happens in a tense, taut new movie called Felon is nothing less than electrifying."
1,Felon gives everyone their tidy and expected due but outlines a realistic enough cycle of how a man's life can easily spiral out of his control.
1,"Directed with pounding energy by Ric Roman Waugh and acted to the hilt by a cast comprising several of yesterday's stars proving their mettle, the movie delivers the thrills and emotion that prison movies require."
0,
1,"Tough, brutish prison drama with an easy windup, but good acting and an uncompromising take on the prison system."
0,"Written and directed by Ric Roman Waugh, and filmed at the New Mexico State Penitentiary near Santa Fe, Felon is one of the most realistic prison films ever made."
0,"A good cast and disciplined direction add some distinction to Ric Roman Waugh's Felon, which is basically the old tale about an innocent man corrupted by a stay in prison."
0,A subplot involving corrupt guards makes the movie even duller than the score that sounds like a rusty squeezebox.
0,"For a film that seems to pride itself on its depiction of prison-reality, it feels extremely movie-phony."
1,"Stephen Dorff's powerhouse perf as an ordinary Joe trapped behind bars with warring ethnic psychopaths propels ""Felon"" well ahead of its expose/exploitation brethren while still avoiding the pious learning curves of Frank Darabont's prestige prison dramas"
1,"It's still white-knuckle tense, and held together by dozens of small, well-observed moments."

0,"Scar is a generic slasher; even it seems jaded with the 'torture porn' bandwagon onto which it leaps, ultimately feeling like WAZ for dummies."
0,"To make a 3-D 'torture porn' movie is at best opportunist; to make one with flat, boring torture scenes is unforgivable."
0,"The acting is more wooden than the numerous coffins, the plot a rehash of any crazed serial killer flick you care to mention, with extra torture. It's unremittingly nasty stuff."
0,"Another week, another yucky horror film with a title that sounds like ""Saw"". This one's in 3D."
0,"Despite the killer's slavering way with a scalpel, there's no blood spurting out into your near-vision, just a lot of hopeless acting in your face."
0,"This boasts of being ""a first of its kind 3D movie event"", but it's just the same old torture porn tarted up."
0,"As one character asks, ""It never stops, does it?"" Well, no. Not as long as people keep paying to see such dreck."
0,"The Unborn is one of those movies evidently conceived by digging a Dungeons & Dragons Fiend Folio out of storage to find, resurrect, and rebrand some long-forgotten bugaboo."
0,"Well, there are some effective scares here, and you'll laugh at yourself afterward just for jumping and squealing like a little girl. But other images and pieces of dialogue are just as hilarious -- and that probably wasn't their intention."
0,"If the use of Nazi atrocities as a MacGuffin for cheap thrills offends you, The Unborn isn't your movie. If, however, you appreciate the sight of a half-naked beauty being terrorized by potato bugs, look no further."
0,"Filmed in Chicago but universal in its lameness...The Unborn is the story of a dybbuk who makes trouble for the skinny North Shore college girl played by Odette Yustman, who's always out jogging when she should be considering a sandwich."
0,"A laughably bad horror flick involving demonic possession, concentration camps and torturous genetic experiments."
0,This is where many a horror movie falls and never again rises: too much exposition.
0,"The movie's not very good, but there are ideas, good and bad, in its execution that are worth mulling over."
0,What darkness the movie achieves comes solely from the lighting.
0,"Before long, the connective tissue between scares starts to call attention to its own preposterousness."
0,"Unless we trudge up the aisle prematurely, we're stuck there, with nothing to do but count Oldman's changing accents or mourn that this is the best gig actresses like Alexander or Gugino can get."
1,The Unborn is a baby-sitter horror flick (it's for and about them) with classic creep-out elements that unite in a surprisingly engrossing story.
0,"At least writer/director David S. Goyer had the sense to boost these generic proceedings with pros like Alexander, Oldman, Elba and Carla Gugino, who plays Casey's mother in a series of embarrassing flashbacks."
0,"Laughable horror flick made from an unstable solution of Jewish mysticism, Nazi evil and an otherworldly demon."
0,"The film teeters so perilously and routinely at the edge of camp, both with some of its casting choices and some unfortunate dialogue...that it's hard to know if Mr. Goyer wants to make us howl with fear or laughter."
0,
1,"Goyer has penned many scripts superior to this one, but he does make sure you're never far away from a big 'Boo!'"
0,"David S Goyer's non-kosher riff on 'The Exorcist' is stillborn,"
0,A scary movie so fantastically stupid and crass it made my skull contract and my sinuses harden to the consistency of pipe-cleaners.
0,The Unborn becomes rapidly tedious even as the body count racks up.
0,It's hard to imagine a more ham-fisted attempt at the genre of 'womb horror' than this flat-footed supernatural drama with a Jewish twist.
0,"The demonic possession plot thereafter breaks down in a tasteless swamp of Nazi experiments on twins, dogs with inverted heads and an exorcism led by rabbi Gary Oldman. Oy vey! The kosher paranormal: a trend in the offing?"
0,"The screenplay by Goyer himself, who wrote Blade and co-wrote The Dark Knight, this time doesn't limber up."
0,"Cue a creepy toddler, various demonically possessed adults and a Jewish exorcism conducted by Gary Oldman. He's a vastly better actor than the film deserves, but he can't make the script seem even slightly better than it is."
1,"[An] exuberantly creepy mash-up of Jewish folklore, J-horror atmospherics, and demonic possession boilerplate."
1,
0,Overblown and underwhelming.
1,"Over-the-top -- and ultimately tiresome -- female mud-wrestling, kick-boxing and cat fights in a parody of old exploitation movies."
0,The target audience must be that awfully precise niche that never tires of women punching each other.
0,The latest proof that calculated camp in the form of homage is nearly impossible to pull off.
0,"The whole package here is warmed-over mush from a hundred other sports movies, a tale padded out with game footage, training sequences, absurd coincidences, life lessons that teach nothing and wasted casting."
0,"Shares the secret sin of many a pigskin pic: Despite all the macho posturing, the corny story is just as sappy as anything on Lifetime."
0,"American rugby is the setting for this earnest sausage party of macho posturing, bro-dacious life lessons and value-focused sportsmanship that give wayward teens the strength to rise above sinful temptations."
0,"Though director Ryan Little puts together a clean, professional package, at bottom this is a nearly-two-hour scrum of therapeutic direct encounters."
0,"It's definitely possible to make artful message movies -- just consider the filmography of ex-Mormon iconoclast Richard Dutcher -- but Forever Strong is generic faith-and-redemption fare, devoid of nuance."
0,"As directed by Ryan Little and written by David Pliler, Forever Strong dredges up every sports movie clich and stereotype ever invented. (Cue the slow-mo in the rain.)"
1,"The movie is well shot and edited, the rugby scenes are enjoyable (if likely puzzling to the uninitiated) and Strong's earnestness excuses at least some of its predictability."
0,This earnest indie production comes across like formulaic fiction while taking cues (and recycling cliches) from the 'inspirational sports drama' playbook.

0,A less tasty martial-arts actioner featuring an autistic kickboxing queen energized by confectionery.
1,"The heart of the film may be its action sequences but, even outside the battle arena, 'Chocolate' is a nicely characterised and consistently likeable piece of work."
1,Another symphony of exquisitely choreographed carnage.
1,Is it radical or offensive? I really don't know. It certainly got my attention.
1,"A bizarre, often tasteless, but never dull Thai martial arts movie."
0,"The slightly slushy plot is really an excuse to catch your breath between the action sequences, which are fast, loud and crammed with references that only Bruce Lee fans will properly appreciate."
0,The director makes sure we know that it all proves how people with special needs can triumph.
1,"The world may not have needed a Thai-language martial-arts hybrid of Kill Bill and Rain Man, but by God, it's got one now."
1,It boils down to this: Thai girl fighting. Is that enough of a movie for you?
0,Chocolate is risibly sentimental even for a genre not known for its emotional sophistication.
1,"It's called Chocolate, but Cheese would have been just as good. Soaked with tears, full of schmaltz, and yet strewn with bodies, Prachya Pinkaew's new kick-'em-up is extreme action, extreme melodrama, and extremely hard to resist."
0,"In the history of marital discord in the movies, has there ever been a blander conflict than the one between firefighter Kirk Cameron and his goodly wife Erin Bethea in the dismal Christian-themed melodrama Fireproof?"
1,This is a decent attempt to combine faith and storytelling that will certainly register with its target audience.
0,"With the production values of a straight-to-video cheapie and the script of a mediocre soap opera, Fireproof is good for just about one thing: dousing whatever flames might be left in your marriage."
1,"Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife."
0,"You probably can't blame pastors moonlighting as moviemakers for wanting to pack their film with multiple messages, but the conversion subplot feels shoehorned into the more crucial marital doings."
1,"While hardly sophisticated in its approach and certainly not polished in its technical elements, the film does get its heartfelt message across with undeniable sincerity."
0,"Unfortunately, the emphasis on what God wants has a way of overwhelming who Caleb and Catherine are as characters."
1,By turns exuberant and goofy and mushy and yearning.
1,"Pic is largely sustained by the trio's screen chemistry, with Bachchan especially good at the louche comic stuff."
1,"It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India (where gay sex is still technically illegal), and does so using contemporary Bollywood's best not-so-secret weapon: star power."
1,The best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen in a very long time.
1,"It's tempting to call The Garden a story of innocence and experience, of evil corrupting paradise, but that would be doing a disservice to the fascinating complexities of a classic Los Angeles conflict and an excellent doc that does them full justice."
0,"It becomes clear that a more thorough, objective and serious journalistic approach was required once the story delves into the intricacies of the property's murky history."
1,"A documentary about fighting city hall, the empty promises of politicians, backroom deals, small victories over the Man and the cost paid by a handful of farmers who endured all of the above. Imagine if John Steinbeck rewrote the script for"
0,"The Garden does a fine job of promoting the power of grassroots advocacy; in almost all other respects, however, this is nonfiction filmmaking that's nearly as dull as dirt."
1,"Scott Hamilton Kennedy's plucky, powerful storytelling makes this a worthwhile experience."
1,"[Director] Hamilton captures the heart-wrenching devastation done in the name of profit, as citizens mourn. Incredibly effecting."
0,"The Garden is an especially fatuous documentary, nominated for an Oscar this year, about a community garden in South Central LA where Latino farmers have been allowed to grow food on somebody else's land."
1,This intricate and compelling documentary paints a saddening portrait of American politics.
0,A good documentary leaves the viewer wanting more. A problematic one leaves the viewer needing more.
0,"Justice and Corruption and Profit are abstractions, and film is so ill suited to deal with abstractions."
1,"Once audiences get over snickering at a creature that they initially write off as a rabid hedgehog (too bad that Geoffrey Rush film already snatched up the title Quills), they'll be happy to strap in for a satisfying ride."
0,"Whenever a romantic couple in a movie goes camping in the remote woods, you just know it's a bad idea."
1,"Spare, effective and genuinely frightening."
1,Splinter has a hackneyed gimmick -- dead bodies trying to smash their way into an isolated convenience store -- but I loved it to pieces.
1,A nifty horror movie that doesn't claim to be anything other than a zippy exercise in creature-feature entertainment.
1,"This is classic Halloween fun, with plenty of thrills and chills, surprisingly believable performances, and healthy doses of humor."
0,The film lacks that spark of originality or humor or thematic resonance that might have elevated it from forgettable genre time-passer to something more lasting.
1,"If you've seen The Thing or The Evil Dead, you've seen much of Splinter, but it's a lean, fast-moving and fun little flick that doesn't waste any of its scant 82 minutes."
1,"[Director] Wilkins understands that what we don't see is often more unsettling than what we do. But he also throws in plenty of well-earned gore, making this an ideal option if you're looking for a few new Halloween scares."
0,"There have been worse horror flicks, but although this one offers a few scares, it doesn't have a lot of imagination."
1,"The movie's awash in blood, sure, but it has more brains on hand than just the ones dripping down the wall."
1,"It's short, taut, nicely shot, well-acted, astutely directed, specific where it might have been generic, original enough to be engrossing and derivative enough to be amusing."
1,"With Splinter, the director Toby Wilkins honors the conventions of the horror genre with skill and enough wit to keep the scares sharp."
1,This is a terrifying film.
1,"It's good, it's just nothing really groundbreaking or special."

0,An identical twins comic crime drama goes seriously wrong.
0,"One Edward Norton performance is often enough reason to see a movie, so it comes as no surprise that the prospect of two -- he plays twins -- is very much the main attraction, and reward, of Leaves of Grass."
1,"Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass is some kind of sweet, wacky masterpiece. It takes all sorts of risks, including a dual role with Edward Norton playing twin brothers, and it pulls them off."
0,"The movie is a showcase for digital technology and for Norton's virtuosity, but I wish it weren't such a weightless shambles."
1,"Leaves of Grass is part goofy drug comedy, part shocking bloodbath. It's a riot of tones and genres, but unlike that other recent hybrid, Pineapple Express, the parts add up to something larger."
1,"The movie bubbles with intellectual curiosity and narrative ambition. And for that I dig it, even if Leaves of Grass has the habit of swerving and sometimes lurching from tone to tone."
0,"It's just another oblique backfire from Tim Blake Nelson, whose work as a writer-director in general wallows in a bog of mediocrity."
0,"It would be overly polite to call this a pale shadow of the tone-shifting Coen brothers farces from which Nelson -- who costarred in O Brother, Where Art Thou? -- is taking his cues."
0,"It's not the violence itself that bothers me, it's just that it completely destroys the tone of the movie."
0,You could get whiplash from his movie's mood swings.
1,"The mirror image gag is one of the oldest in the book, and yet, if done well, it never really gets old."
1,"As a writer-director, Nelson keeps the laughs coming at a steady pace, and never condescends to his articulate redneck characters."
1,"Mr. Norton is a pleasure to watch, and so is everyone else."
1,An offbeat thriller that is deepened -- rather than derailed -- by its tricky shift from darkly funny to just plain dark.
0,"I could only bear 35 minutes, and I haven't walked out of anything since 'You, Me and Dupree.'"
1,"This agreeably amusing comedy/romance/musical is Another Mash-Up Made by Bollywood. Writer-director Aditya Chopra's film suggests a star-powered Billy Wilder love farce, Grease and Shall We Dance."
1,"Silly, lightweight, overlong and unoriginal; this is nevertheless shameless romantic entertainment that will undoubtedly be a hit. Welcome back Raj!"
1,Diverting romantic antic about a sham engagement is sparked by the bright chemistry and comic timing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.
1,"The Proposal won't catch any bouquets for originality, but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops."
0,"You know every tinny beat and false note by heart, from the implausible setup to the sprint-to-the-airport finish."
0,"The Proposal could have been much smarter, and much hipper. Instead, it settles for silliness and sentimentality."
1,"Bullock's longtime fans should be happy to see her fully engaged in a role that suits her and paired, at last, with her comic equal: Reynolds."
1,The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible.
0,So we've got a prodigal son who has the chance to deal with his father issues and discover things about his heretofore evil boss. It's like a romantic-comedy clich챕 twofer.
0,"All the romantic comedy conventions are shamelessly on parade in The Proposal, trampling on our brains and turning them into mush."
1,"Bullock is one of those actresses that help prove that, when done right, a romantic comedy can be a wonderfully satisfying thing."
0,"The Proposal is a standard-order, by-the-book romantic comedy that offers nothing remotely fresh or new while following a formula even neophytes know by heart."
1,"The Proposal coasts along on likability, right up to its standard-issue ending; what it doesn't do is surprise us in any way."
1,"Though it falls short of winning our hearts completely, The Proposal is a serviceable and intermittently funny romance made enjoyable by the sparks between Bullock and Reynolds."
0,"And though Bullock and Reynolds have snappy chemistry to spare, their love affair stops just shy of being believable. There are too many awkward 'tender' moments and not enough vigor for a real romance."
0,Why a screenwriter would think hilarity would ensue from this premise is anybody's guess.
0,The problem is not the acting. The problem is what these actors are required to say and do.
0,"Just looking at the poster for The Proposal, a by-the-numbers romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, tells you exactly how it's all gonna go down."
0,A romantic comedy so numbing it feels like Novocaine.
1,"The setup is formula, but Bullock and Reynolds supply surprising fizz and kick."
0,"Following 27 Dresses, this is the second high-concept, low-impact, wedding-themed comedy in 18 months for choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher. It might be time to move on."
0,"Somehow, someone decided this rom-com needed less rom and more com -- a fatal mistake."
1,"The Proposal recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out. You see it coming from a great distance away. As it draws closer, you don't duck out of the way, because it is so cheerfully done, you don't mind being hit by it."
0,"Instead of being about dinosaurs and time warps, it's about gags that were old when dinosaurs ruled the earth."
1,"Thanks to casting and chemistry, this is the first great romantic comedy of the summer."
0,"It's impossible to guess why Bullock was ever attracted to this insulting role, and the eternally confident Reynolds is miscast as a young, bullied underling."
1,"Shamelessly derivative, contrived and predictable, The Proposal is nonetheless a crowd-pleasing romantic comedy."
0,"A mostly harmless, completely unsurprising romantic comedy."
1,"The Proposal is just a good old-fashioned romance, one in which people actually bring out the best in one another rather than the worst. How novel is that?"
1,"A romantic comedy doesn't need to be original to be enjoyable, and yet The Proposal still falls way too short of the mark."
1,"It isn't a film with a lot of big guffaws, but I smiled through most of it."
0,"Like most Hollywood romantic comedies these days, The Proposal is all about bringing a woman to her knees."
1,"Onscreen chemistry is an elusive notion but you know it when you see it, and Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds definitely have it in The Proposal."
1,"A straight-ahead romantic comedy that relies on the considerable charms of its stars, The Proposal feels so comfortable and familiar you might feel like you've seen it before."
0,The script encases Margaret in rusted defenses from which it can't free her without awkward leaps and cheats.
1,"[A] buoyant vehicle for Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, whose chemistry is a happy surprise."
1,"Nobody who ever attended a date movie will be surprised by what happens, but The Proposal has low expectations and good vibes in its favour."
0,"In the end, nothing can compensate for the fact that Bullock has been so diligent in ridding herself of any trace of niceness that she looks as if she's regretting the whole thing. Boredom doesn't suit her and a romcom without charm just doesn't rate."
0,"As one embarrassing scene follows another, The Proposal accumulates so many bad vibes that it becomes grimly compelling."
0,Sloppy and lazy.
0,Believability really goes out the window here.
0,They may as well have called this one 'Mis-Matched Sham Wedding Comedy #57513' for all the effort it makes to shake new life out of a tattered genre.
0,"One minute you're watching a 21st-century remake of His Girl Friday, the next you're having to endure some awful, dumbed-down ""women's picture"". Bullock deserves better."
0,"Sandra Bullock is teamed up with Ryan Reynolds, and each star's face has a waxy immobility that has nothing to do with Botox; the pure awfulness of the script has paralysed their facial muscles."
0,"The more recurrent noise towards the end was me groaning with disappointment, that a movie which had struck gold with its central matchmaking was succeeding so ruthlessly in taking the shine off."
0,So keen to be cute it curdles our stomachs and so anxious to be funny it jellifies our funny bones.
0,Another dagger in the back of romantic comedy.
0,"This turns out to be another bad choice for Bullock who, without playing badly, sinks in the general morass."
0,
0,"The characters and situations are a little too quirky for their own good. Everyone is skewed off-center and, while that can be charming in small measures, Gigantic overdoses on it."
1,"The various twilight performances of the veteran players deserve a look, as do the always interesting appearances of Mr. Dano and Ms. Deschanel. Only the sparks are missing this time."
0,It looks like it was made for one-half of Joan Crawford's old soundstage Pepsi-Cola budget and sounds like it was written by chimpanzees.
0,I don't remember ever wanting to just haul out and punch a movie before Gigantic.
0,Any resemblance the film bears to real people and real situations is purely coincidental.
1,"Quirk fans, prepare to be lightly exhilarated."
0,"Seriously? Indie directors are still making painfully twee, self-conscious romances all these years after Sundance birthed so many quirky cliches?"
0,"With its off-center dialogue and upscale industrial settings, Gigantic strains to be original. But beneath its indie affectations it is really another contemplation of generational misunderstanding."
1,"The script is sharp, well written, and with some strong performances, especially John Goodman."
0,I felt like I was being hit over the head with a quirky club.
0,"On the basis of Gigantic, Matt Aselton can make a fine and original film. This isn't quite it, but it has moments so good, all you wish for is a second draft."
0,"Anyone can go off and just cynically make a bad movie, but to make a picture as inert, incompetent and emotionally fraudulent as Gigantic takes sincere faith that one is, in fact, making something really, really good."
0,"Eventually Gigantic decides to become a heartwarmer, and why not? Any ending -- including nuclear devastation or a 1940s musical number -- would have worked, too."
1,"First-time feature director Matt Aselton, who co-wrote the darkly funny, well-observed script with Adam Nagata, has crafted a disarming tale that's one of the better independent films in recent memory."
0,Aselton's reason for making this movie is easy to discern -- he wants to be a filmmaker. But coming up with a reason for watching this movie is more of a challenge.
0,One of those indies that seems to be trying to top the quirkiness quotient of Juno.
0,"Gigantic plays like a Sundance movie with half the nouns removed; fetchingly cryptic for a while, it's ultimately just obscure."
1,Zooey Deschanel is the most delightful young actress in Hollywood.
0,This determinedly nonsensical American indie feels like it was assembled in an off-world quirk factory.
1,"'Gigantic' is a film that succeeds by wearing the viewer down, as an infuriatingly coy, self-conscious first act gives way to a sweet and affecting climax."
0,"It's slyly misogynistic, dramatically inert, and wastes an intriguing boorish cameo from John Goodman."
0,"This film is entirely empty: empty of substance, devoid of plausible characters, and without anything like a satisfying style."
1,"Here the characters drive everything - they're quirky without being annoying, funny without being clownish and odd but realistic. As funny and interesting as it is, however, the film raises more question than it answers."
0,"The film obviously got a grant from Cool Aid, the endowment fund targeted at US filmmakers with nothing to say but a million airheaded ways to say it."
0,"It's kooky, it's quirky, it's dippy, it's trippy, it's loopy, it's screwy - it's indie, and boy, it's annoying."

1,"While Fuel takes persuasive swipes at the influence of oil-based energy companies over domestic and foreign policy, the film is more dazzling as an introduction to all kinds of clean energy alternatives many of us have never heard of."
1,"Smartly animated interstitials, memorable archival material and a lively soundtrack round out the fast-paced proceedings."
1,One of the refreshing traits of this action-nudging documentary is Tickell's willingness to wrestle his own biases.
0,There's not a single (even moderately) dissenting voice in Fuel; you're either on the biodiesel bandwagon or raping the planet.
1,"It's a slickly enjoyable production (if unfocused and bloated), and his bullet-point tips are persuasive; but dude, there are better ways to humanize these issues than crying on camera."
1,"Thanks to an informative, buoyant tone and the director's own restless intelligence, the film preaches to the unconverted with passion, energy and graphics so clear that they would make Al Gore weep all over his PowerPoint."
1,"A peppy, bouncy documentary that is watchable and informative, although Tickell's celebrity name-dropping at times detracts from the serious message."
0,The label slapped on the side of Mark Tonderai's low-budget horror movie has absolutely no bearing on the silly contents.
1,Mark Tonderai's debut makes for a smart calling card but relies on one tension-destroying clich too many and offers too few thrills to satisfy the hardened horror buff.
0,"Teasingly enjoyable rubbish through the first hour, Orphan becomes genuine trash during its protracted second half."
1,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra, working from a devilishly clever script by David Leslie Johnson, maintains steady suspense while mercifully mixing in some moments of dark humor."
0,"A pretty interesting movie about the crack-up of an American family lies right under the filmmakers' noses, but in their rush to deliver shock and gore they miss every opportunity to make a smart movie."
1,Orphan works because it's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be -- creepy as all get out -- and does everything possible to achieve that goal.
0,It feels too slow and moody for the Halloween crowd and too absurd and silly for more discriminating horror fans.
1,"I didn't mind wasting two hours watching the truly ferocious Furhman teach Max how to play Russian roulette and snickering when Kate thinks to Google ""children who kill."""
0,"Overlong and overwrought, Orphan stays faithful to every clich of the genre."
0,"Surely writers David Leslie Johnson and Alex Mace deserve their own circle of hell for thinking up the story, which moves with breathtaking cynicism from disturbing to grotesque to perverse to ludicrous."
0,What could be an interesting horror film just turns ... horrible.
1,One of the best entries in the cute-as-a-button-psycho-demon-child-from-hell subgenre.
1,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra moves Orphan along efficiently, doling out a 'boo!' shot every few minutes with mechanical professionalism."
0,"If director Jaume Collet-Serra set out to make a parody of horror-film clichs, he succeeded brilliantly."
1,"During a summer with the usual transforming robots and young wizards, this chilly flick is a bit of a break, and there are worse options than letting this Orphan in the door."
1,A thoroughly enjoyable demon-spawn movie in the tradition of The Bad Seed (1956) and The Other (1972).
1,"Here is a shamelessly effective horror film based on the most diabolical of movie malefactors, a child."
0,"There's a surprise ending, followed by several bonus endings, and we're not giving anything away in noting that the film's titular adoptee has more lives than Chucky."
0,"Clocking in at more than two hours, the movie teeters between psychological horror and violent blood-letting and, as such, probably won't completely satisfy fans in either camp."
0,"While the third-act surprise twist of Orphan must have looked wicked-good on paper, on screen ... not so much."
0,"The scares are often the generic, push-off-the-slide variety and Orphan doesn't add much to the genre except, disturbingly, a fetishistic bent that's creepy in the wrong way."
0,"Although reasonably, cheesily suspenseful, the movie takes a long time to get going. Its tagline, 'There's something wrong with Esther,' turns out to be a masterpiece of understatement."
1,"The film rests on Furhman's shoulders, and she's up to the task."
1,"The best thing about Orphan, is the way it plays with the genre's overused staples and its sophisticated audience's expectations."
1,"It's a cut above most spooky-kid movies, with a twist that sets it apart."
0,"Actors have to eat like the rest of us, but you still have to wonder how Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ended up wading through Orphan and not laughing."
1,"So sloppy, so lowdown, so shameless and so entertaining, Orphan provides everything you might expect in a psycho-child thriller, but with such excess and exuberance that it still has the power to surprise."
0,"[Orphan] never exploits the dramatic possibilities, despite the efforts of its excellent cast and gorgeous production values."
0,"To really get under your skin, a bad-seed horror movie needs a demon child whose dastardliness sneaks up on you. There's nothing too subtle, however, about Esther."
1,
1,"It's bloody, you should be warned, but in the end it is worth it."
0,Painfully predictable.
0,It would be harder to find a more dark and joyless thriller on the market than this one.
1,"This wickedly entertaining, if slightly over-stretched, variation on the familiar 'evil child' scenario displays an unusually complex grasp of twisted psychology."
1,"If you're not easily offended or upset, there is much to enjoy in Orphan. Horror films this skilfully made don't come along that often. You probably won't find a better one this year."
1,"Some impressively committed work from Farmiga (even when Googling ""Children who kill"") and a humdinger of a twist make this a rather good bad seed."
1,"Directing with a wink and some style, Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) knows that it's possible to be totally absurd and witty with it -- he has that trash touch."
1,"That director Jaume Collet-Serra made House of Wax, the Paris Hilton remake, does not bode well. But stars Vera Farmiga and Peter Saarsgard, as mum and dad, find a few frail pegs of humanity to hang their characters on."
0,"A squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip."
1,Lifted above the average by a pretty nifty twist and some unnecessarily good acting.
1,"It has atmosphere and tension, and the performances are far better than usual for this sort of caper."
0,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax) endows this ugly mess with a slew of unintentional laughs, but not enough to repay the 123-minute time suck."
0,Decidedly amoral.
1,
1,"If you're going to make a weepy, there's no reason you can't make it with intelligence and insight as the makers of My Sister's Keeper have done."
1,"Unsubtle, uneven and undeniably effective."
1,"My Sister's Keeper is a shameless weepy, one of the most manipulative and fundamental of genres, but it also raises some surprisingly difficult and thought-provoking ethical questions."
1,"A lot of things don't work that well in My Sister's Keeper, a tearjerker adapted from Jodi Picoult's best-seller. But one thing is guaranteed: The movie practically forces you to shed a tear or two."
1,Films that present a moral dilemma and make us consider the unthinkable are as rare as bargain popcorn in the summer. Cassavetes manages that feat and turns this weeper into a keeper.
1,The writing team of Jeremy Leven and director Cassavetes have joined forces with a great cast to bring the best-selling book by Jodi Picoult to life with a purity that can only be called inspirational.
0,Makeup department realism alone can't redeem the dramatic fallacies surrounding it.
0,"A moving story, but the film's overly romantic tone rings hollow."
0,Don't avoid My Sister's Keeper because it's a film about a serious issue. Avoid it because it approaches that issue like a very special episode of Grey's Anatomy -- complete with whining pop songs and all the comforts of cliche.
0,A shameless attempt at manipulation that wants but doesn't earn audience tears.
0,"You may cry at the film's designated crying times, approximately every 10 minutes, like the traffic and weather. Or you may not, and wonder instead why some high-gloss weepies treat their source material quite so shamelessly."
0,"Less an exercise in catharsis than an obstacle course of premise-heavy, flashback-drenched plot points, it's an emotional flat-liner, even though virtually every character (including Alec Baldwin as the lawyer) carries some hurt or grief."
0,"This book hasn't been adapted, it's been taken outside and shot."
0,"It would take a heart of stone not to be affected by My Sister's Keeper, but the film's unceasing manipulation has a Medusa effect on the organ."
0,"It's a family melodrama that never misses the opportunity for a heartbreaking, acoustic musical montage that brims with portent, as if we could forget that losing a child is hard and terrible."
0,"Surrounding and ultimately subsuming this ethical struggle is a fair amount of pediatric-cancer horror and mush, though Cassavetes is frequently bailed out by his cast."
1,My Sister's Keeper is an immediate audience-grabber.
0,The infuriating cop-out ending reduces the premise to mush.
0,"My Sister's Keeper targets tear ducts so ruthlessly, it might as well be sponsored by Kleenex."
1,"A surprisingly lovely movie about an absolutely awful subject, My Sister's Keeper features what also may be the year's first performance worthy of Oscar mention."
0,"My Sister's Keeper takes on a very tough subject, but ultimately it is too soft, too easy, and it dissolves like a tear-soaked tissue."
1,My Sister's Keeper humanizes vexing questions about medical ethics without sacrificing rattling family drama.
1,"Although the compelling courtroom drama gets forgotten for much of the movie, My Sister's Keeper also is relatively realistic about the physical and emotional toll of disease."
1,"With solid performances and an intelligent script, My Sister's Keeper offers a moving and powerfully realistic portrait of a family stalked by tragedy that somehow manages to emerge from crisis battered but intact."
1,"For all its awkward structure, the film is heartfelt and deeply affecting."
0,My Sister's Keeper takes a compelling ethical dilemma and turns it into formulaic pap by trying relentlessly to ensure an emotional reaction with sentimental exploitation and plot contrivances.
1,"An adaptation that, although departing dramatically from such key elements as the book's ending, will please fans."
0,"My Sister's Keeper offers a couple of twists, one of them crucial and the other cruelly unnecessary and melodramatic."
0,"My Sister's Keeper has a gutsy premise, but no guts."
1,"My Sister's Keeper, like all tearjerkers, works as a ritual as much as it does art."
0,"Their message in My Sister's Keeper? Cancer sucks, but there's always the balm of beach scenes and an emo soundtrack."
1,
1,I found the movie to be really tough and challenging and enjoyable.
0,I have a heart. I just don't want schlock.
0,"Where restraint might have raised up My Sister's Keeper, a heavy hand has brought it down."
0,"Diaz is a whiny irrelevance, but sharp supporting work from Alec Baldwin and Joan Cusack makes the proceedings tolerable for boyfriends."
0,You should consent to having treacle intravenously injected into your system sooner than go to see this Hollywood weepie.
0,"By the end we are screaming to yank our engines away from the forecourt as fuel spills - all that piano music, that gilded lighting, those glycerine tears - threatening a pyre of sense, sensibility and supersensitive subject choice."
0,This medical-ethics drama is like a sustained assault on the tear ducts.
1,"My Sister's Keeper becomes a well-heeled weepie in which the family's comfortable existence, despite the misfortunes of fate, is hardly challenged at all."
1,"The decision to avoid unnecessary sentimentality defines this film, elevating it to a more thoughtful if a touch less engaging arena, sacrificing emotional escapism for conversation provoking tragedy."
1,Bring the tissues. This film works.
1,"Head-poundingly (in a good way), sidesplittingly funny."
1,The Hangover is surprisingly clever as well as R-rated rowdy.
1,"Miraculously, we still like Alan and Stu and Phil even as we crack up when they get tazed and beaten. Phillips has pulled off a feat of balance that rivals Cirque du Soleil down the Strip."
1,"A comedy that stays weird and wild for the first two-thirds, only to disappoint in the final act."
1,Very funny.
1,I think this is going to be a big comedy hit this summer.
0,You'll laugh three or four times and probably won't remember why.
1,"The Hangover has scattered laughs (many in the cathartically funny end-credit montage), but overall it's more amusing than hilarious."
1,It's so funny it might convince you that sometimes the raunchy journey is worth the laugh-out-loud reward.
0,"It's hilarious in spurts and several bit players score, but the movie doesn't have enough momentum to carry it through the dead spots."
1,An unusually palatable entry in a rancid genre.
1,"The Hangover remains unrepentantly irresponsible and hilarious throughout, culminating with what could be the funniest montage ever to grace a picture's end credits. The summer's first sleeper hit has arrived."
1,"The latest in the wave of post-Judd Apatow Bad Lad comedies, The Hangover is rowdy, scurrilous, and, for about three-quarters of its running time, a lot more hilarious than it has any right to be."
0,It's a film about forgetting that seems designed to be forgotten.
1,"Though the film falters toward the end, The Hangover is a side-splitting adventure you'll still be laughing about the morning after."
1,"The payoff to the mysteries isn't nearly as interesting as the setup, and the ending of the movie is disappointingly squishy. But while it's riding a hot streak, The Hangover is a rush."
1,"I'm going to say, at the risk of doing time in the blurbitentiary, that The Hangover is the Citizen Kane of bachelor party movies."
1,"Now this is what I'm talkin' about. The Hangover is a funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny"
0,"The movie smells like a hit, but honestly: Helms excepted, did it need to be quite so blandly cast, or quite so lamely raunchy?"
1,There is a sort of perverse brilliance or brilliant perverseness to be found in this story of a bachelor party gone terribly wrong.
0,"The Hangover, like the condition for which it's named, has some spirited moments, but more often it stumbles and slurs, regurgitating earlier pleasures and praying for the fog to lift."
0,"Amusing as it is, it never feels real."
1,Memento meets Old School? It's party time.
1,"Every summer needs at least one silly, dirty comedy, but The Hangover may end up being one of the few to actually get the mix right."
1,Surprisingly funny and smartly acted.
1,"Superbly cast, well-written and so silly it makes your teeth ache."
0,"Early in this unraveling adventure, a Vegas tourist quips, ""Some guys just can't handle Vegas."" Yeah, we know a couple: writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore."
1,You're likely to hear all about it as friends and co-workers endlessly quote lines or re-create scenes.
1,The funniest movie so far this year.
1,"Waking up with a hangover and no memory of what happened the night before is an experience most people can relate to, but it's also a surefire device for comedy."
1,"The Hangover should be a huge hit this summer for laugh-starved audiences; happily, it delivers."
0,"This kind of 'one crazy night' tale relies on drum-tight structure to work. Without it, The Hangover sputters to a sentimental halt."
0,This is a bromance so primitive it's practically Bro-Magnon.
1,"A strong cast, a quirky script with some unexpected twists and a steady hand from the director's chair make this a desert ride on the wild side a worthy road trip."
1,"Even though Apatow has no fingerprints over this movie, The Hangover follows in the same surprise-me tradition: It takes us to the dumb side but comes back with something unexpectedly affecting."
1,"Phillips, with a script credited to Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (and with loads of loose-limbed interpretations from the cast), captures the amity among a group of grown men set loose without spouses, girlfriends, or sobriety to hinder them. (Or help.)"
1,"The Hangover ain't art, but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams."
0,"Outrageousness proves hard to sustain, and after a stomach-lurchingly quick start, The Hangover slows down and, by the third act, fizzes out like Alka-Seltzer in a highball glass."
1,What hangover? This movie is safe as milk.
1,"Unlike most so-called ""comedies,"" this one can claim the virtue of being reasonably funny."
1,"You might be embarrassed by laughing at some of the silliness, but don't be: Everyone else will be cracking up, too."
0,"An intriguing, time-hopping set-up is wasted on obnoxious characters, celebrity cameos and crass attempts at humour."
0,The lads duly lurch from one bewildering crisis to another.
1,"It turns out to be every bit as crass, offensive and incorrect as you'd expect, but it's also - gulp! - really very funny an awful lot of the time, as well as bizarrely gripping."
1,"Everything works here; the characters are funny, the set-ups are funny, the lines are funny."
1,"The Hangover serves up a steady stream of big, dumb laughs, but you may feel a gnawing sense of guilt right afterwards."
1,"Laugh? Well, at least, on a tough Tuesday in Tube-meltdown London, one chuckled."
1,"Some very funny, very non-PC dialogue is thrown about like a game of catch. The actors, virtually unknown, are terrific."
1,"The director and his screenwriters have come up with the funniest film to appear in ages. It avoids the predictable crudity and silly laddishness (well, almost) you'd expect, and delights with zinging one-liners and charming performances."
1,"This is an above par effort, excellently played and just naughty enough to be thought daring as well as amusingly spiteful."
1,The Hangover is funny but not deeply so. There's a difference between funny incidents piled up in a line and people who make us laugh because of who they are.
0,"This perfunctory retread had a tame, made-for-TV feel, and not just because the humdrum cast is composed of network and cable B-listers."
0,This remake turns a fondly remembered horror/thriller into a mild and tedious suspense film.
0,"Even by horror-remake standards, The Stepfather sets the bar for pointlessness."
0,Better to honor history and rent the original.
0,"The trouble with the movie, apart from its rather monotonous dourness of tone, is that everyone in the family... comes off as tougher, smarter, and quicker on the draw than the stepfather who's supposed to be outfoxing them."
1,"The Stepfather is that rarity, an effective remake of a screen classic that can stand alone on its own considerable merits."
0,A clumsy remake of the 1987 cult thriller.
0,It's hard to get absorbed in a story with so many unresolved issues.
0,That last stormy night of violence should be the shocker. Giving away his ruthlessness in earlier killings robs the movie of it its payoff as it saps the climax of much of its power.
0,"There's mayhem all over the place and not a policeman, or much logic, in sight. Watchable nonsense, with performances better than the story deserves."
0,"Not so much a contemporary re-make of Joseph Ruben's 1987 psychological thriller as a lobotomised bastard step-child: over-plotted, over-long, and stripped of the original's sharp, satirical subversion of suburban family values."
1,"If the movie's attic-bound climax is a little predictable and the plot holes rather gaping, The Stepfather, unlike many of its more prestigious A-class competitors, is never less than entertaining."
1,"It's all very silly, but effective popcorn entertainment."
0,Nelson McCormick is ridiculously lax with inventive or plausible staging: it's the kind of movie where a door can't open without thunderclaps and the bad guy flinging himself into the frame.
0,Fond memories of Joseph Ruben's thrillingly unpleasant B-movie of 1987 will be offended by this bland and almost blood-free remake.
1,TV scribe Kundo Koyama's first bigscreen script peppers the proceedings with rich character detail and near-screwball interludes that shouldn't fit but somehow do.
0,Departures needed a little more work in the morgue -- like cutting to the bone.
1,"Like Sunshine Cleaning, this is a gentle comic tale of grisly ?쮍mployment opportunity in desperate times. Only Departures is tender and, at times, rather squishy."
1,"Departures is built for simplicity, and, if nothing else, the appeal to decency and integrity of this sweetly old-fashioned tale make it a must for Bernie Madoff's prison Netflix queue."
1,"Multiplexes are crowded with noisy summer films, from which Departures will represent a sophisticated and elegant departure."
0,Here's a great way to start savoring life: Don't waste it on pat manipulations like this.
1,"The plot involves some developments we can see coming, but they seem natural, inevitable. The music is lush and sentimental in a subdued way, the cinematography is perfectly framed and evocative, and the movie is uncommonly absorbing."
1,"Director Yojiro Takita uses the changing seasons to echo the characters' moods; the score by Joe Hisaishi (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) has a suitably majestic sweep."
1,"Takita is blessed with actors who move lightly, gracefully within this landscape."
0,"[Director] Takita could easily trim 30 minutes of flab and oceans of tears from Departures. It still wouldn't merit an Oscar, but it would be a lot more watchable."
1,The film is far from perfect but has enough going on to compensate for its excessive length and some sentimentality.
1,"Though events unravel predictably, the film is profoundly affecting, thanks to a well-written story, rich characters and superlative acting."
0,"It is, I'm afraid, unlikely to reflect much glory on the Oscar nomination process and the voters in general."
0,"Overlong, predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos."
0,
1,"Departures is a film steeped in warmth, tenderness and genuine conflict."
1,Incredibly moving.
1,"The ultimate beauty of the film rests in its symbolic details that bridge the abyss between the living and the dead. As the French might say, it is to make one cry."
1,"Departures is such an elegant, beautifully mounted meditation on death, funeral customs and parent-child relations that you may find yourself sniffling and resisting simultaneously."
1,Yojiro Takita's movie simultaneously tickles tears of mourning as it wrings laughs about the meaning of life.
0,"It breaks no new ground, offers no audacious insights or rude revelations; toe follows tac as surely as tac follows tic."
1,"Departures quietly subverts aesthetic and emotional expectations. There are moments where the story could turn maudlin or veer into bad taste, but the high-minded intent is never lost."
1,This is the kind of tastefully poignant drama that asks its audience to confront taboos and then pats them on the back for doing so.
1,"It is as polished as it is heavy-handed, and it leaves one under a spell."
1,Departures is a loving tribute to the Japanese way of death.
1,The winning nature of the performances outweighs Takita's more obvious choices.
1,"Departures is sometimes macabre and sometimes manipulative, but the way it speaks to the spirit is miraculous."
1,A moving celebration of life through showing reverence for death.
1,Takita eventually pushes the emotions too hard but by then I had lost all resistance. It's a beautiful film but take two hankies.
1,"Departures is about life, death, grief and loss, but it's also, in a quietly effective way, about coming to terms with expectations."
0,"The movie gestures towards deep emotions, but an abiding soft-grained superficiality effectively insulates us from the piercing realities of grief."
1,"Fascinating, witty and heartfelt."
0,Yjir Takita's bitter-sweet tale of the Japanese funeral trade plays a bit like a formal service itself.
1,A safe and emotionally generous crowd-pleaser.
1,"Moments of clarity and pragmatism are contradicted by flashes of inanity and dry, if well-delivered humour."
1,"Departure's cynicism, ironically, is what makes the optimism of its last act so moving."
1,
1,"Naturalistic performances, long takes, unfussy edits and a story that unfolds over a few hours are all present and correct."
1,An impressive chamber piece by a director who needs watching.
1,"This is a tough, shrewd, intelligent movie."
1,"The film remains dour, truthful, grimly droll."
1,"Watching these women perform is a striking lesson in ballet's rigorous aesthetic alchemy -- and the extreme, exquisite individualism that prevails."
0,Ballerina has the feel of a propaganda puff piece put out by the Russian tourist board.
1,"Ballerina will be of interest mostly to balletomanes, but even folks who don't know their right foot from their left will find inspiration in the lives of these devoted dancers. Besides, who isn't moved by Swan Lake?"
1,"If only a glimpse, the privilege compensates: one wants more from Ballerina because the world it reveals -- elegant and harsh, glamorous and grinding, classical and obsolete -- proves so rich in exquisite contradictions."
1,"Such a brief glimpse into these women's lives and art whets the appetite for more; alas, Ballerina ends far too quickly, leaving only their willowy shadows behind."
1,A jewel of a documentary.
1,The movie is an admirable look into the venerable St. Petersburg company and how dancers thrive or just survive in the physically challenging world of dance.
1,"As dazzling as they can be in performance, the ballerinas are even more breathtaking when a camera catches them alone in the shadows, dancing only for themselves."
1,"Dance aficionados will be sent over the moon by this compelling documentary from director Bertrand Norman, chronicling what it takes to be a prima ballerina in the Mariinski Theatre."
1,
1,"It's creaky, predictable and frequently idiotic. But for a tipsy Saturday night, this should tick all the right boxes."
0,A 14th-century road movie with 21st-century cuss words.
0,"A CGI freakout at the finale can't save this mundane medieval thriller about witches, devils and disillusioned knights."
0,Season of the Witch is a fine example of a film that would've been great fun if only its creators had a sense of humor about the wild brew of absurdity they had percolating.
0,Welcome to the January dead zone.
0,"Directed by the perennially hollow Dominic Sena from a script by Bragi Schut, ""Season of the Witch"" is all seams. It never balances out its competing desires..."
0,"The stench of plague is all around, unless that's an aroma emanating from the script."
0,"It's entertaining in a cheerfully ridiculous way, though Cage fans will be disappointed that he does not really lose his rag, despite some serious provocation from the Lord of Darkness."
0,"It's part fairy tale-gone-wrong, part recycled legend, part panto horror. Think The Wolfman, or Van Helsing, only worse."
0,"Cage plods through the story with a stiffly restrained, exaggeratedly earnest performance that makes him look like the most awkward amateur in the local Society For Creative Anachronism troupe."
0,"Did either Cage or Sena even bother reading Bragi F. Schut's patchwork script, before adjusting the wig, flicking on the camera and cashing the pay cheques?"
0,"It takes place during the 14th century, but everyone speaks in contemporary language, which might have been acceptable if the dialogue were clever or intelligent or funny or, you know, good."
0,"Off the top of my head, I'm guessing that ""Season of the Witch"" claims a place in the top five all-time bizarre and pointless homages to art cinema."
0,"Cage alternates between leaden line readings and thunderous outbursts, making his accomplished costars Ulrich Thomsen and Stephen Campbell Moore look even better. But the movie's worst aspect is the CGI, which packs no scares whatsoever."
0,Even the most dedicated of Nicolas Cage's fans will find little to enjoy about the historical-fantasy-action romp Season of the Witch.
0,Another movie is turned into a turkey.
0,"The film is not altogether dreadful, although it's far from good. And that's not good. Classic stinkeroos are rarer than masterpieces, and we all need a laugh now and then, even if the laughs are inadvertent."
0,"Season of the Witch is as bloodless as a starved vampire. Instead of a review, it deserves a stake in the heart."
0,"Audiences considering ""Season of the Witch"" should heed the timeless advice of its ancestor ""Holy Grail"" -- run away!"
0,"Rather than elevating this wanna-be Hammer horror flick, Cage somehow lowers its quality."
0,"A mishmash of horror and history genres that's not as bad as its trailers but ultimately is dragged down by, of all things, its star."
0,"Really, at its worst, the whole thing's a little bit like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" - - the jokes."
0,"Ever since Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" was remade as ""Last House on the Left,"" his work has suggested a rich mine for homage."
0,"It's got videogame-from-hell F/X, + jousting, + Cage in tangled long hair he seems to have mistakenly put in the washing machine."
0,"Cage's old pal Dominic Sena is a decade removed from their ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" directing glory, and he gets nothing out of this script that isn't pure hokum."
0,Cage is effective as a falling down drunk in Las Vegas or a treasure hunter navigating goofy road trips but not as a disillusioned champion of the Church going one-on-one with a demon. Steven Seagal would have been more believable.
0,"It's Centurion Deux without the second-coming-of-Carpenter pretense, though you still wish the trashiness were more distinctive."
1,Director Dominic Sena sets a quick pace; the dull moments are brightened by the unexpectedly likable team of Cage and Perlman.
0,Another forgettable trifle from Cage.
0,"After a while, the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money."
1,A decently twisty indie thriller about hostages lured aboard an airport minivan whose destination is nowhere pleasant.
1,"If you step aboard Shuttle, be prepared for one heck of a ride filled with suspense, action and ever-escalating terror. With this ingenious thriller, Edward Anderson, who wrote the heist flick Flawless, makes an audacious directorial debut."
1,"Shuttle mostly exists, in the words of Alfred Hitchcock, to 'put the audience through it,' but it leaves you in a very different place than where it started and with remarkable economy of effort."
1,Shuttle is a grim and twisted exercise in high-stress terror that falls just short of the torture-porn subgenre.
0,"When the payoff finally arrives, it seems tasteless not just because of its topicality, but because the shock feels unearned."
0,"There is no release for the audience, no 'entertainment,' not even much action excitement. Just a remorseless march into the dark."
0,
0,This Playboy fantasy farce is one of those painful comedies in which the strain to be funny shows -- always.
0,"When it comes time to wheel Hefner out for his cameo, even he seems irritated by these guys."
0,"March gets the mean-to-funny ratio wrong; it's misanthropic, smutty, and smug, but with a few notable [Craig] Robinson-engineered exceptions, never even remotely chuckle-inducing."
0,"Miss March is, to use the vernacular of the escapist moviegoer, the biggest pile of crap I've seen in ages."
0,"When the movie was going to come out a month ago, it was called Miss February. Then the release date changed, and so did the title. Now it's Miss March. Miss This would have been more helpful."
0,"My blood runs cold at the memory of Miss March, a 90-minute rip-off of the J. Geils Band song Centerfold whose multi-hyphenate creators prove themselves actor-director-writer-failures."
0,The funniest thing about the monumentally stupid anti-comedy Miss March is that somehow the producers convinced Playboy to sign off on the thing.
0,The showpiece gags range from the stale to the grotesque.
0,The problem with Miss March is that it isn't very funny.
0,"Overall a raggedy, unfocused affair that wastes both directors' acting talent and feels like too much work between the laughs."
0,Forget waterboarding -- just show Guantanamo detainees Miss March and they'll say anything.
0,"Forget March, this one misses by a mile."
0,"Anyone who goes to see Miss March hoping for a voyeuristic, '80-flavored T&A smutfest will be sorely disappointed."
0,"The movie's aiming for the drunken college crowd but most of the gags have the nervous, giggly idiocy of two middle-school kids flipping through dad's Playboy."
0,"Hugh Hefner shows up to give an addled lecture after Eugene and Tucker make it to the Playboy Mansion, and you think: Wasn't it just last summer that he so sweetly played himself in The House Bunny?"
0,"A crude, crass, virtually laugh-free sex comedy."
0,Miss March must be a contender for worst film of the year. It's so poor that you begin to suspect it's a pastiche.
0,"A whiff of what I can only describe as pure evil billows off the screen while this comedy is playing: a buddy grossout picture with zero laughs and a persistent, chilling misogyny."
0,"An almost perfect atrocity. It is a towering K2 of bobbins... the most mangy, noxious, charmless, sexist, racist, unfunny, infantile, stomach-turning, grotesque, clueless, inept and stupid film of the year."
0,A dire gross-out comedy that tackles many of the same themes as Adventureland but without an ounce of subtlety or wit.
0,"This ""comedy"" might be the Worst Movie Ever Seen, even with the aftershock of the Wayans Bros' Dance Flick still lingering."
1,The reason to see An American Affair is Gretchen Mol.
0,"Only Noah Wyle, as Adam's unreadable dad, rises above the muck; he deserves his Tarantino-aided resurrection sooner rather than later."
0,"If you can get past the exploitation-of-minors thing, there's a tawdry exuberance to moments like the one in which the twerp and his overage girlfriend drunkenly splash paint on each other."
0,"Sketchily written, clumsily directed and poorly acted, even history-conspiracy aficionados will be left cold."
0,"It's all presented so earnestly... that you barely realize at the time how preposterous it all is. Intrigue! Cubans! The Bay of Pigs! JFK! It's the coming-of-age tale filtered through the mind of Oliver Stone,"
0,"This is not, by any reasonable definition of the term, a professional film, even though several experienced and established actors have been inveigled to inhabit it"
0,"It's a good rule of thumb that any film that grandly puts ""American"" in its title is going to try to make some statements way beyond its pay grade."
0,Even Oliver Stone would giggle.
0,"Gretchen Mol, lounging semi-nude as she smokes near an open Georgetown window, would spark any young man's curiosity and recklessness. But the assassination story line is absurd."
0,"Subscribes wholeheartedly to the history-as-pornography school of thinking, in which all will be revealed if you can figure out who is sleeping with whom, when and where and what they do in bed."
0,"The Cuban Missile Crisis is a year passed and the assassination is looming, and yet Adam's pubescent crises are given Wagnerian emphasis."
0,Painfully contrived
0,"Start to finish, [the film] makes absolutely no sense."
0,"There are scenes that work here and there, but regrettably not nearly enough to hold the film together. In the end, this affair is definitely not one to remember."
0,"The title sums up the bland, unimaginative and cliche-laden thriller/coming-of-age tale."
1,"An earnest, fictional coming-of-age story is squeezed from a bitter, true-life local tragedy. And it works."
0,
0,"Creepy, yes, but what's the point of all of this bratty, poignance-free bloodletting?"
0,Paul Solet's gyno-horror flick is certainly twisted but only slightly unnerving; the movie is about as gripping as one might expect given that its infant monster is both mute and cradle-bound.
1,It's a horrifying meditation on the unbreakable union of mother and child.
1,"Keeps you on the edge of your seat, or perhaps the edge of fleeing the theater."
1,"The principals, especially Ejiofor, rise above the starchiness that often hampers portrayals of recent, monumental history."
1,"William Hurt and Chiwetel Ejiofor, impressive at opposite ends of the table as a government mouthpiece and a philosophy professor, provide all the fireworks the story needs."
1,"So while the earthbound sequences may drag, when 'The Red Baron' takes to the skies, it soars."
0,The Red Baron is like Le Grande Illusion remade by a German porn director. Never in the field of human film-making was so much money wasted on so little.
0,"A very low-flying, sentimentalised account of the life of legendary first world war German air ace, Manfred Von Richthofen."
0,"The dogfights are competently handled, and Headey looks awfully sweet in her Boden version of 1917 mufti, but the stodgy comic-book dialogue keeps shooting plausibility down in flames."
0,Nikolai Mllerschn's film about the German flying ace has nothing like the sort of flair it needs to get away with its sentimental departures from the historical facts.
0,"His plane may be red, but the dialogue is purple."
0,The propaganda films produced by both sides in the '30s and '40s might've been objectionable for many reasons but at least they had the good sense to show real planes in action.
1,"If the film is intelligent and thoughtful, it is unfortunately lacking in energy and passion; it is more a somber, highly familiar reflection on warfare and its toll than an action movie."
0,Drama about World War I flying aces never gets off the ground.
0,"Although the film has an undeniably strong, suspenseful tone -- not to mention symbolic resonance -- it doesn't rise above its overly familiar setup."
0,"With a low-budget look, cliched dialogue, a stale plot and so-so acting, this supernatural thriller is unlikely to achieve the phenomenal success of its fabled predecessor."
0,"[Director] Myrick does an admirable job of spinning tension from a group of guys mostly standing around, but too often the film's portentous tone seems more silly than suspenseful."
1,"In this year's crop of Oscar-nominated shorts, the animated category beats the live-action offerings."
0,Moore steals Happy Tears by underplaying -- in what may be the warmest performance of her career.
1,"Happy Tears is less of a mess than it looks like, despite its quirk-infested, baggy midsection."
0,"Happy Tears, is simply weird. The funny has gone missing."
0,"Lichtenstein dutifully unpacks the family's unhappy past, but he's so easily distracted by surreal dream sequences and colorful supporting characters that his main story gradually dries up into a sitcom."
0,"Other than the guest-starring appearance of Cy Twombly canvases, nothing distinguishes this poor relation of The Savages from all the other emotionally fraudulent Amerindies about familial dysfunction and reconciliation."
0,"Not even the reliable Posey can salvage this slag heap, and fans of the iconic Indiewood starlet -- Poseyphiles? Parkerheads? -- will be especially crestfallen."
0,"A vulgar, happy-as-cancer aberration that takes the dysfunctional family idea to a new low. Whimsical, yes. Happy, never."
1,Hollywood's strong female actors have in Lichtenstein a young talent who gives them the roles they deserve.
1,"Happy Tears is a complete mess of a movie, but Lichtenstein conjures some sweet moments and striking metaphors -- and none more striking than Posey's $500 boots, which look either black or blue, given the available light."
0,"Happy Tears settles for the usual moments, even at its quirkiest."
0,"On its way to a climax that ends every plot strand on an unrealistically upbeat and pat note, Happy Tears loses sight of what made the film so engrossing in the first place."
1,"In the role of a dialed-down, capable woman, Demi Moore suggests dramatic possibilities for future roles. She projects a kind of calm, and it's attractive."
0,"A cringe-inducing, self-consciously kooky indie comedy that's best enjoyed for its taste of Rip Torn, who, judging by his recent alleged bank break-in, comes to loose-cannon stuff naturally."
0,Writer and director Mitchell Lichtenstein struggles to find the humor in a host of horrors.
0,"A drab, pale-looking affair without a trace of visual style, this cross-country pursuit yarn fights a losing battle to sustain viewer attention via narrative alone, so much does it flounder for lack of imagistic flair."
0,"All of which is well and artsy, but doesn't diminish the sense, once the mystery has untangled, that the film has been gesturing toward a profundity that isn't there."
1,"Though Ryan Samul's textured cinematography makes the stubble and shadows seem nearly 3-D, the story chokes on a dull twist from Rosow's past."
0,"Shannon's performance takes The Missing Person as far as it goes, but when a real-world tragedy commandeers the story, Buschel's thin pastiche falls to pieces."
1,"Sluggish, stylized and frequently washed in a bilious green tint, The Missing Person is yet oddly irresistible, its omnipresent anxiety like a musical chord that neither rises nor falls."
1,"""So you make jokes and smoke cigarettes,"" a lady in the murk summarizes. Yeah. Isn't that enough?"
0,"Michael Shannon is a handsome kook whose turns in Revolutionary Road, Bug and this have earmarked him to be the next Jack Nicholson (or at least the next Christopher Walken)"
1,"It's a great-looking movie, with an evocative use of music and, in rugged-yet-sensitive Michael Shannon, has an actor whose forceful, focused presence is the film's sturdy linchpin."
1,Buschel makes striking use of the Mike Hammer/Philip Marlowe tradition to tell a story of disorientation and loss in a post-9/11 world where the Twin Towers can go missing too.
0,The real mystery here is how writer-director Noah Buschel talked recent supporting Oscar nominees Michael Shannon and Amy Ryan into doing this movie.
1,"There's a pretty good film if you give writer-director Noah Buschel a chance. The 31-year-old crafts a convincing noir tale, with a sense of realism that makes the experience pleasingly voyeuristic."
0,"The atmosphere of the film is similar to the Ellery Queen detective stories of yesteryear, but the result is not nearly as good."
0,It's clear from Polanski's cramped frames that [director] Chapa knows as little about filmmaking as he does his subject.
0,This Friday the 13th Los Angeles vanity release isn't even fun in a bad-movie way.
0,Comes with too much repetitive exposition and lacks an emotional payoff.
0,"English, Tagalog, and Thai are spoken in Swedish writer-director Lukas Moodysson's Mammoth, but he communicates only in the idiom of Crash and Babel: the Esperanto of feel-bad humanism."
0,"The movie lacks the personal touch that's distinguished even Moodysson's ""difficult"" films."
0,"The overlapping stories, the emotional disconnect, the heavy-handed symbolism -- no, it's not a movie from the makers of Babel, its a mumbling, stammering copycat drama from Swedish director Lukas Moodysson."
0,"In Mammoth, when a rich child eats her lunch in New York, a poor boy in the Philippines cries. And so it goes, as privilege begets exploitation with grimly deterministic logic and pages and pages of bad dialogue."
1,Mammoth manages to be as affecting as it is heartfelt.
0,Any semblance of subtlety was unfortunately lost in translation.
1,"There are so many reasons to be outraged and depressed by this film, indeed, that it all but distracts from the real and immediate qualities of the four fine actors."
1,The movie is at once intimate and (in its softhearted way) preachy.
1,"Too many films exploit the perils faced by children when the social contract is ruptured, but Mammoth earns its cruel, sensationalistic turns and then some."
0,"An interesting idea, but Mammoth's good intentions -- like its characters' -- are lost somewhere in the delivery."
1,Mammoth is a masterclass in feel-bad cinema.
0,"[A] fatuous, self-serving and fantastically dishonest exercise in pseudo-compassion, composed in the supercilious ""globalised"" style of Alejandro Gonzlez Iarritu's 2006 film Babel."
0,As woolly and elephantine as its title.
0,
0,"[A] Babel-ish drama about the malaises wrought by globalisation, how we're closer than ever, and yet, if I'm not mistaken, farther apart. Unfortunately, you've seen it already."

1,"Berlinger doesn't counter Chevron's counter charges with facts and figures. With footage of petrochemical-sludge swamps and babies covered with flaming sores, he doesn't especially need to."
1,"Joe Berlinger's remarkable documentary, Crude, recounts an infuriating litany of South American exploitation, backroom glad-handing, and bureaucratic dead ends."
1,Involving doc about the devastating impact of oil exploration on Ecuador's rainforest community.
1,"Mr. Berlinger has both a strong narrative instinct and a keen eye for incongruous, evocative and powerful images."
1,Crude is remarkably clear-eyed in the way it shows how even people on the right side of a cause only succeed if they're willing to play a little dirty.
1,The film is fair (which is different from being objective) and works hard at representing both points of view. That it's already been denounced in some quarters is only proof he has the oil companies worried.
1,Here's a powerhouse of a documentary that makes you feel mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.
1,No film could convey all the complexities of the case -- what Crude does is air the plaintiffs' claims and show the lawyers at work.
1,Powerful and powerfully upsetting.
1,"A legal thriller, it's a three-year investigation into the disaster environmentalists call the ""Amazonian Chernobyl"" that offers both sides of the story and leaves the viewer in the position of jury."
1,Berlinger provides a bracing and intelligent look at how such battles are (and perhaps must be) fought in a world that's hardly lacking when it comes to tales of injustice.
1,"It's a David-and-Goliath tale, full of anger and disturbing accusation, but it's also inspiring."
1,"If you ever had doubts about the impact that celebrities can have on such a David-and-Goliath struggle, Berlinger methodically removes them."
1,"At first Crude looks like one more environmental agit-doc intended to outrage and inspire. Director Joe Berlinger is no doctrinaire hack, though."
1,"As the film very eloquently implies, when the greater good is defined as profits, and a lack of culpability is proportionate to your number of shareholders, well . . . a lot of petroleum-soaked chickens will be coming home to roost."
1,An engrossing case for justice.
1,"A gripping, multifaceted thriller about media politics, global economics, and legal infighting. Wherever your sympathies fall, this may teach you a lot about the way the modern world works."
1,One has to wonder if oil industry executives are concerned about the release of Joe Berlinger's damning documentary.
1,"What Crude does best is take us behind the scenes and show in often candid detail how campaigns are waged, tactics decided on and strategies prioritized."
1,"A bleak, necessarily incomplete tale, and suffers from a late intrusion by celebrity eco-botherer Trudi Styler. But with this gripping, angry film, Berlinger has put himself back on the side of the angels."
1,"Although the real-life outcome may be known to some, Crude still, at its best, unfolds like a courtroom thriller."
1,"The Ecuadorians' fight continues, and their courage isn't to be doubted. Even the much-mocked, much-maligned campaigner Trudie Styler emerges with credit for supporting them."
1,"Structurally a little jumbled, it's still a worthy addition to the angry eco-doc subgenre."
1,"Gripping and powerful, Crude is documentary journalism as it needs to be. Blissful ignorance stirred with bland apathy is no longer an option."
0,"Few of these films ever take solid, substantive slices of truth or attestation from both sides. They are always partial, which vitiates the eagerness with which we would, if we could, espouse the cause of downtrodden."
1,Joe Berlinger's film is a suitably forensic dissection of an ecological disaster and much less of a crusading piece of polemic than documentaries such as An Inconvenient Truth.
1,"The arguments are batted back and forth, and one's sympathy for the Ecuadorean side takes only a slight wobble when Trudi Styler gets behind the cause."
1,
1,A penetrating assessment of post-war readjustment.
1,"The Messenger manages to be both practical and patriotic in the same breath, zeroing in on one of the most painful aspects of wartime."
1,"This is a fully felt, morally alert, marvellously acted piece of work. Despite the grim subject, it's a sweet-tempered movie, with moments of explosive humor -- an entertainment."
0,A story that strays about without finding its center.
1,"The Messenger honors those who fought and died in Iraq by acting out, with an anguished handheld immediacy, how large each of those sacrifices really is."
1,"The Messenger, showing humanity under siege, opens wounds inflicted by the Iraq War -- not on the battlefield but in the hearts of the families of soldiers who never made it back home."
1,"What The Messenger has going for it is some sober, straightforward direction from Oren Moverman and a few strong performances."
1,"Harrelson's calm performance anchors the film, and whenever the story drifts back to him and his cautious friendship with Foster, the flick feels true."
0,"Many scenes in The Messenger feel merely illustrative, not designed to develop characters and story so much as to make the point, over and over, that the home front can be as harrowing as the front lines."
1,"A somber drama about intimate wartime tragedies, Oren Moverman's debut feels more respectful than real."
1,Oren Moverman's sober and satisfying drama shows how the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have created a fissure in American society.
1,"Messengers with the worst possible message, they nonetheless manage to be human and alive .... In a film that itself bears sad tidings about the costs of war, that is an affirming, even an inspiring, gift."
1,"Together, under the assured direction of first-time feature filmmaker Oren Moverman, these three actors tell a story that is at once hard-hitting and bizarrely gentle."
0,"For all the film's gritty verisimilitude, The Messenger is not the great Iraq War movie that Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is."
0,"A shoddy, shouty bore. A piece of flummery."
1,"I'm not sure how Morton made sense of her character's ebbs and flows, but I never doubted her. She's a mariner in uncharted seas of emotion."
1,"The Messenger is a privileged glimpse into people's private pain, a drama shot with the simplicity and immediacy of a documentary."
1,"The Messenger knows that even if it tells a tearjerking story, it doesn't have to be a tearjerker. In fact, when a sad story tries too hard, it can be fatal."
1,Foster leaves you hoping that Will finds his way home.
1,It brings home the horror of the Iraq war in a way that much of our TV news media have failed to do.
1,"Some jobs are dirtier than others, and after seeing director and co-writer Oren Moverman's beautifully acted new film The Messenger, you'll be better acquainted with some of the most grueling work a human being can be called upon to perform."
1,This film doesn't take political sides -- and it's all the more heartbreaking because of its restraint.
1,"This is a wholly different look at the fallout of the Iraq War and its effect on soldiers and civilians. It is also a gentle portrait of grief, friendship and solace."
1,A forcefully acted and peculiar emotional drama...
1,"The Messenger delivers what it has to say without sensationalism or political posturing. That restraint, along with the quality of the performances, makes it all the more powerful."
1,"The beauty in Foster's portrayal is that it never completely explodes, but anger and aching seethe behind his eyes. Harrelson, meanwhile, is a good old boy with a bad old job."
0,"Whenever writer-director Oren Moverman moves past these scattered and admittedly voyeuristic moments into the lives of the two soldiers, the movie drifts into received wisdom and unconvincing romance."
1,"At its center lie three accomplished performances, by Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton, that are not to be missed."
1,"With the insight and sensitivity of an insider, The Messenger illuminates the sometimes invisible victims of war -- the survivors -- and a pain that is tolerated but never quite healed."
1,Harrelson gives us layers of hurt under a callous yet needy crust. It may be the best performance of his career and certainly deserves Oscar consideration.
1,"The bombshell is the news of a soldier's death and the delivery of that message is the heart of this unsentimental, yet deeply moving, story."
1,"The film is premised on the verbal communication of urgent information, yet its many non-verbal moments provide the greatest strength and clarity."
1,"The film is poised, unforced and powerful."
1,"The film does lapse into cliche with Foster's descent into alcohol as a means of coping with the daily trauma of the job, but Israeli director Oren Moverman keeps the film rich in raw detail."
1,The Oscar-nominated script pursues a grimly honourable task into its grim and not always honourable byways.
1,"[An] unpredictable, episodic, deeply resonant character piece."
1,An intelligent and well-acted film which deserves its outing here.
1,"It's a film of quietly assured dramatic clout, a strong and sober reckoning with American conscience."
1,"Stumbles a little, loosening its grip in the bromantic final stretch. But if impenitent heartstring pluckage is what you're after, this is where it's at."
1,
1,An extraordinary anti-war film that does not engage in polemics. The Messenger's extreme effectiveness is due to the brilliant acting of Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson.
1,"This sweetly ingenuous film, written and directed by Bohdan Slma, is a lot less sentimental about cows and flowers than it is about its human protagonists, who fall domino-like in love with churls who won't love them back."
1,"Directed by Bohdan Slma, it deals with weighty issues -- loneliness, sexual identity, love (straight and gay) -- in a quiet, intelligent fashion."
1,The film's portrayal of farm life as a rugged pastorale lends The Country Teacher a foundation of visceral truth.
1,"It's a movie that demonstrates, if you'll pardon the sports metaphor, how deep the bench is in Eastern European film."
1,"Liska, who looks like a Central European version of the young Harvey Keitel, has a kind of pitch-perfect opacity."
1,"Despite all the pain and self-loathing of its wounded characters, it's a pretty, heartwarming picture that tells us everybody needs somebody to help shatter that ol' boulder for good."
1,"The film is graced with lovely performances by Pavel Liska as the teacher, Zuzana Bydzovska as Marie and Ladislav Sedivy as the boy."
1,The film boasts subtle performances and curious situations with unpredictable outcomes.
1,It's the kind of film that Hollywood used to excel at but no longer seems interested in making.
0,"If great movies resulted purely from wizardly technical displays, then Czech writer-director Bohdan Sl찼ma's The Country Teacher would be a masterpiece to give B챕la Tarr pause."
1,"A gleeful, tender and even sentimental film."
1,Wilder and IAL Diamond's brilliantly witty screenplay has a serious undertow as it savages corporate ethics and conjugal infidelity.
1,"There is a melancholy gulf over the holidays between those who have someplace to go, and those who do not. The Apartment is so affecting partly because of that buried reason."
1,Elevates the workplace romance into a sublime erotics of officious addresses (the omnipresent Mister and Miss) and economic conundrum.
1,
1,"In the canon of classics by famed writer/director Billy Wilder, this jewel of a comedy easily stands as one of his most beloved."
0,"I wouldn't call this 1960 picture one of Billy Wilder's best comedies -- it's drab, sappy, and overlong at 125 minutes."
1,"Most of the time, it's up to director Wilder to sustain a two-hour-+ film on treatment alone, a feat he manages to accomplish more often than not, and sometimes the results are amazing."
1,"With tremendous performances by the two leads (Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine), this is yet another ""must see"" title to be found on Wilder's resume."
1,Not to be missed on any account.
1,"A comedy of men's-room humours and water-cooler politics that now and then among the belly laughs says something serious and sad about the struggle for success, about what it often does to a man, and about the horribly small world of big business."
1,"Directed by Wilder with attention to detail and emotional reticence that belie its inherent darkness and melodramatic core, it's lifted considerably by the performances."
1,Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine shine as two essentially good souls trapped in a tangle of office politics.
1,"Wilder has made some truly great movies, but this one is not the masterpiece we thought it was."
1,"Wilder, a bilious and mercurial wit, here becomes a wide-screen master of time ..."
1,"Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be."
1,"All this is quite a load for a comedy, but where else has social comment ever been so effective? Wilder hones his points to a piercing edge..."
0,You can feel yourself growing older in the 90 minutes it takes to watch this horrid piece of filmed dinner theater.
0,"Aside from the occasional magical shot or affecting actor moment, it's a film whose poverty betrays most every frame."
0,Trying to sit through The Golden Boys is like trudging across the Cape Cod sand in galoshes during a nor'easter with a mule on your back.
0,This musty yarn would have worked better as a 1940s MGM programmer.
0,"The Golden Boys is an object lesson in how to squander a seasoned cast, a charming premise and a breathtaking location."
0,"It seems particularly perverse to take actors who helped develop the '60's thesping style of hang-loose, semi-improvisational immediacy and stick them in a creaky period piece glazed with arch gentility and ersatz quaintness."
1,Brim[s] with enough confidence and promise to carry you through the predictable narrative.
0,"Rated PG, it's almost laughably bland and watered-down in its desire to appeal to the widest possible audience."
1,"Much of Fame draws us in, through the irresistible appeal of young people bursting with energy."
1,"A film that's largely a raw, uplifting love letter to creativity in every possible form."
0,A cheesy production with underdeveloped characters that feels more like a TV pilot than a self-contained motion picture.
0,A watered-down tone ... causes the movie to drift dramatically between its musical and dance sequences.
1,"Mullally has the most poignant moment, admitting to her students that the reason she teaches is because fame, for her, just wasn't in the cards. (Stardom, more than in the first film, is golden here.)"
0,"As a demo reel showcasing seven promising young talents from their freshman through senior years, it's pleasant enough. As a movie dramatizing the talent and dedication required to make it, the Fame reboot has fleet feet but lacks heart."
0,Lives are spared in this sugarless new version of Alan Parker's movie and the TV show it spawned. But innocent songs and unsuspecting dance routines are hacked to bits.
0,"This Fame is a film without the guts to show Idolized America that, as Debbie Allen so memorably said way back when, ""Fame costs, and right here's where you start paying."""
0,Forget about living forever: This new Fame will be lucky to hang around for a month.
1,"Familiar? Yes, but not nearly as vapid as most of the musical material out there that encourages teens to believe fame is all that matters."
0,"The new Fame is a sad reflection of the new Hollywood, where material is sanitized and dumbed down for a hypothetical teen market that is way too sophisticated for it. It plays like a dinner theater version of the original."
1,"It's almost fatally modest. But it has a sweet spirit, and it offers only one true moment of inadvertent camp: a (lame) finale featuring an African dance routine completely at odds with all the white bread we've just been served."
0,"There are six new songs in the remake, but not one makes any impact, or is likely to end up as the ring tone of 2010."
0,First-time filmmaker Kevin Tancharoen struggles to flesh out the 10 characters we meet during their freshman year at PA.
1,"The production numbers are great, sometimes jaw-droppingly so."
0,"Way back in 1980, when the Oscar-winning theme song of the movie Fame declared ""I'm gonna live forever,"" it was easy to believe the lyric was an example of artistic license. Now, it's not so clear."
0,This film makes even the most gaudy of Saturday night TV talent contests look like Dostoyevsky in comparison.
0,"Culturally derivative, structurally bland and almost meaningless."
0,"A desperate, cynical -- and most likely unsuccessful -- attempt by a dying studio to stave off oblivion by jumping on the High School Musical bandwagon, exploiting one of its legacy titles in ways that dishonor the original."
0,The awful truth about no one from the Fame movie or TV show going on to become famous may not yet have dawned on the cast of this new and bizarrely pointless remake.
1,"""Already?"" the woman behind me said plaintively when the words ""Sophomore Year"" flashed up on the screen. That's the joy of this Fame. Like the old ones, it convinces you that high school, if not life, should go on forever."
0,"That fame seems assured to those who merely crave it -- without sacrifice, or spiritual and physical effort -- emerges as the underlying message in this sanitized and unrewarding production. Simon Cowell has much to answer for."
0,"The picture is fitfully effective, but the story disappears in the editing bay. The movie has about as much heft as watching jesters and fire eaters at a village fair."
0,"Fame offers slick entertainment with some exuberance, but it's devoid of soul or heart."
1,"Pleasant, undemanding entertainment for drama-club kids and the people who love them -- a family-friendly salute to young performing artists."
0,"A big, bland and bogus clone of a movie update, which runs a half-hour less than the original and only feels like forever."
0,Unconnected shreds of plot suggest severe editing at some stage and neither characters nor musical routines add up to much.
1,"[Its] hyperreal documentary quality is combined with a borderline fantasy feeling, which will probably drive some literal-minded viewers up the wall, but which is actually the movie's best element and its one claim to distinction."
1,"Suffers from a surfeit of flash, it nonetheless offers the undeniable power of young performers pursuing art at peak dexterity."
0,"NYC high school students sing, dance, emote in acting classes, and otherwise insist that America's got talent, but this unnecessarily tepid, conservative remake of 1980's far more famous and affecting original Fame suggests otherwise."

0,"I don't mind the cornball and I don't mind the clichs, but I just think that the thing has to be executed a little better than this."
1,"There are enough hoary soap-operatic plottings for a thousand Gossip Girls (emotionally distant parents, almost-rapes, suicide attempts), yet Tancharoen individualizes each crisis so that no one character comes off as a mock-universal surrogate."
0,"The high school is so sanitized that there are no drugs, cutthroat competition, or-inconceivably for a theatrical milieu-no gay students."
1,"Auds, regardless of their politics, will find Kirby Dick's filmentertaining, brisk, visually interesting and perhaps even thrilling."
1,"Dick approaches his subject with little of the self-righteous effrontery of Michael Moore or Bill Maher, instead maintaining a modicum of objective distance and even mustering a certain sympathy for both the accuser and the accused."
1,"You'd expect a documentary about closeted gay politicians who hide their sexuality behind virulently antigay voting records to be a diatribe. But Kirby Dick's furious, deft, revealing film is ?쮐umane enough to separate the sinner from the sin."
1,"Outrage isn't after punitive embarrassment, but the gloves definitely come off."
1,This film is a muckraking provocation whose time has come.
1,"Despite its title, Outrage is calm, riveting, and provocative, taking pride in officials who come out and and taking aim at those who remain closeted."
1,"A crisp, efficient, sometimes petty but often infuriating documentary about alleged gay politicians who actively campaign and vote against gay rights."
1,"After a relatively dry beginning, the film builds in passion and intensity until attaining a stirring cumulative power."
1,Outrage more than lives up to its title and should spark vociferous debate.
1,"As public officials, do closeted politicians deserve to be outed? The targets of Kirby Dick's provocative documentary are branded by their hypocrisy, making them -- in the eyes of those represented here -- fair game."
1,"It's a film that will cause a lot of talk, but its most compelling aspects are not its most obvious ones."
0,Hypocrisy? Your call.
0,"It would be nice if the film had less of [McGreevey] and even more on some of its lying politicians. And was willing to entertain, at least for a moment, the idea that other motives might be at work than simple, internalized self-hatred."
1,"Outrage is essential viewing -- a film that offers a window into modern politics, and the political obstacles faced by gays and lesbians around the country."
1,This indignant and methodical documentary offers a lot of insight into the ideology and psychology of present-day political homophobia.
1,"As always, Dick brings passion and immediacy to what's essentially a series of talking heads; his position on the issue is clear and powerfully argued."
1,"There is an undercurrent of anger coursing through Outrage, but the anger is unusually restrained and eloquent."
0,"[A] passionate, engaging, but sometimes irresponsible expos."
0,"The film's pretty good about saying why so much in the culture encourages a political life in the closet, either tacitly or directly. But even The Advocate had a problem with calling it a brilliantly orchestrated conspiracy."
1,"Outrage succeeds as activism, but it excels as a window into certain political psyches."
1,"Dick takes aim after those who are more than happy to legislate your sex life, just so long as it doesn't curtail their own."

0,"With all due respect, I expected a better time."
0,"Director Anthony Fabian and his team of writers have lost sight of the conflicts inherent in her story, relying on TV-movie clich챕 and tired, unsuccessful attempts at emotional manipulation."
1,"Laing's troubled history is full of heart-wrenching tragedy and, for most of its running time, Skin is very effective. The trouble is, it feels quite small, more like a Movie of the Week than a fully fledged feature."
1,"This quietly intelligent drama, based on a true story, finds a new way of dramatising race, class and society in apartheid-era South Africa."
1,"If anything, you wish for a bit more bite and artistic daring."
0,"The melodramatic, mediocre score runs roughshod over such subtleties and highlights how fundamentally conventionalised Skin is."
0,"A dull, stiltedly scripted potter through re-warmed liberal indignation and heart-on-sleeve emotion."
1,"The early scenes are slightly stiff, and the acting uncertain, but this story of estrangement is sufficiently remarkable in itself."
1,You could hardly call this a timely film but it does remind us of the evils of racism and the misery it causes.
1,"Workmanlike, but enormously moving."
0,"Unable to probe the complex relationships engendered by a biracial society, Skin simply becomes an example of colorless, by-the-numbers apartheid cinema."
1,Sophie Okonedo again shines in this unusual but fact-based apartheid drama.
1,"This unadorned but affecting drama about Sandra Laing, who attracted media attention in the 1950s when her white parents fought the South African system, suffers from a one-note script, but still does right by its tricky subject."
0,"The direction is never more than conventional, with a tear-inducing finale better suited to a TV soap opera."
1,"In a day when it's difficult to say something new about the racial divide, Sandy's story has a poignant power as it underscores just how deeply the fissures run even when it's all in the family."
1,"We don't need overwrought performances to understand the calamity of her life or to weep when her parents turn their backs on her. If anything, the story demands restraint because, invariably at the movies, it's the gentle touch that hits harder."
1,"Skin is a tragic, enraging, and uplifting tale."
1,"Director Anthony Fabian lets the story sell itself, and it does so partly on the strength of the lead performance by Sophie Okonedo."
1,Skin is a moving and smartly made account of a truly peculiar episode from the period of apartheid that existed as national policy in South Africa until just 15 years ago.
1,"As told by director Anthony Fabian, Skin is both exasperatingly choppy and exceptionally moving."
1,"What takes that story of heartbreak and makes it ultimately heartwarming is that Sandra's story, much like the history of apartheid itself, doesn't end there."
1,"Sophie Okonedo, so good in Hotel Rwanda, is fine here as well."
1,"By the end, the incredulity stems not from the fact that this happened but that the wider world didn't know about it before now."
1,This great film by Anthony Fabian tells this story through the eyes of a happy girl who grows into an outsider.
1,"Every emotion is underscored with sugary music, every narrative plot progression telegraphed with the mechanical structural stiffness of a made-for-TV movie."
1,"Potent, still relevant and inspiring while maddening, Skin shows some of our best and much of our worst."
1,Provocative.
0,"Laing's life, despite its inherent melodrama, does not automatically lend itself to the screen. And without the aid of a smart script or a prevailing sense of delicacy, a movie about her or apartheid risks being a blunt instrument."
0,"While it's important we never forget the horrendous evils of humanities past, Skin is sadly one social studies class too many."
1,"You couldn't call this audacious British debut a success; it's too arch, awkward and over-extended for that. But, oddly, it's those very same qualities which make it arresting to watch and which mark out its two directors as talents to keep an eye on."
1,"A moody British/Irish co-production, Helen is beautifully photographed and blessed with a wistfully atmospheric score, but it's a little bit creaky in some of the performances."
1,"The final sequence, in which the directors boldly refuse any neat tying-up of their story, is bracingly intelligent. Lawlor and Molloy are real talents with a distinctive, if evolving, film-making language of their own."
1,"Molloy and Lawlor's film, arrestingly well-composed and sound-designed, has a woozy suggestiveness that's nothing if not promising."
1,"Just as the story grips you it ends, leaving you mystified beyond the call of the enigmatic plot."
0,"It's a neat idea, of one life ""standing-in"" for another and starting afresh, but badly handled. It's a glum 79 minutes."
1,It is a plain and simple story which is told so directly and with such a lack of obvious sophistication that it finally triumphs beyond all expectation.
1,"Its beauty and sadness are simply overwhelming. Anglo-Irish cinema gets a new, fully-formed identity."

1,"Those who thrive on gore, twisted sexuality and brutish handling of women can drink their fill from this film. More serious arthouse critics, however, may balk at the script's soapy excesses."
0,An overlong stygian comedy that badly needs a transfusion of genuine inspiration.
0,The movie as a whole-which runs nearly two-and-a-quarter hours-has no sense of rhythm or flow whatsoever.
1,"It's fun (if overlong), but for all the noisy slurping, there's no fresh blood."
1,"A gaudy, daring, operatic, and bloody funny provocation of a melodrama from Park Chan-wook."
1,"Its turgid pace creates a queasy fascination all its own, drawing viewers into an ever-darkening locus of sin and obsession where even the wish for redemption comes at a terrible cost."
1,Park's voluptuous style fits a genre that is all appetite -- or should be.
1,"Feeling anemic? Allow Dr. Musetto to prescribe large quantities of human blood. You'll find plenty of it in Thirst, from Park Chan-wook, one of South Korea's leading filmmakers."
1,"Park has created a rumination on morality and mortality that is not at all deadly, but funny and profound and at times intensely erotic."
1,"At a time when so much of popular culture is turning the vampire into just another gently exotic, vulnerable lover, Park brings things back to bloody basics."
0,"Soaked in blood though it is, Thirst leaves some essential cravings unsatisfied."
1,Thirst is a brilliant and gruesome work of cinematic invention as well as a passionate and painful human love story.
0,"Thirst's excesses will entertain some viewers, but if you want coherence, look elsewhere."
0,Thirst is at least a half-hour too long. The story goes off course with pointless distractions and feeds on non-stop grisliness.
1,There were moments where I was genuinely scared and moments where I was genuinely moved.
0,"Funny at times, perhaps not purposefully so, it's never truly scary or even thrilling."
1,"Thirst is juicy filmmaking -- psychologically rich, cathartic, kinky, visually engaging and almost free of vampire-movie clich챕s."
0,"Too bad the film never quite gets the blood pumping in the viewer, which may be a failure of Park's to define his audience."
1,"Movies exist to cloak our desires in disguises we can accept, and there is an undeniable appeal to Thirst."
1,"[U]nlike most exercises in hematic excess--Richard Rodriguez's Planet Terror, for instance, or Tarantino's Kill Bill--Thirst offers not the consolations of camp but the intensity of opera."
1,"Thirst keeps coming up against the limitations of its various inspirations like a bumper car on a crowded court. On almost every other level, the film's audaciously entertaining, at times even quite moving. You just have to have the stomach for it."
1,"Park aficionados are assured their fix of lurid imagery and baroque plotting, though straight-up horror buffs may get restless during the sluggish and murky middle section; Twilight fans need not apply."
0,"Thirst begins with great intellectual and artistic promise, then devolves into a repetitious mess of teeth, blades, necks, bites, arterial sprays, sex, sex, sex and death."
1,"Thirst is a grim antidote to the sanitized, pale young things of Twilight, Supernatural and True Blood."
0,"What the film is saying, so far as I can tell, is that, if cut, you will bleed. And bleed."
1,"A rollicking, hysterical splatter-sex-comedy only confirms 'Thirst' as one of the year's more extreme, enjoyable entertainments."
1,"With its rapacious appetites and forceful directing style, is definitely a vampire film for grown-ups."
1,"Not one of Park's best films, but it has bite."
1,This fervid extravaganza is easily Park's best film since Oldboy.
1,Red blood and black humour spurt hard as Thirst reveals itself to be one of the most deliciously skewed incisions into the vampire romance subgenre.
1,"Once on course, he is uncontrollable. I don't mean the hero, I mean the director. Park's gallows wit and visual inventiveness keep us alert for an hour amid the ramshackle story structuring."
1,"The film is way too long, and quite sick, though Park's demented lyricism will stay with you."
1,"Park is clearly an exceptional director capable of being weirdly funny, quirkily fantastical, brutal and sexy, sometimes at one and the same time. There's no one quite like him."

1,"Rational behavior takes a backseat to genre requirements, though few if any will care when the killers stalk each other with such a tongue-in-cheek sense of destiny and deliver deadpan dialogue that makes fun of their own absurdity."
1,"Johnnie To and Johnny Hallyday have a bloody good time in ""Vengeance,"" a smoothly executed revenge thriller that finds one of Hong Kong's genre masters in assured action-movie form."
1,"If indeed there is anything surprising about this clich-packed genre fare, it's the degree to which To and his screenwriter Wai Ka-Fai are prepared to indulge their flair for the ludicrous."
1,A formula thriller done as an elegant genre exercise.
1,More than once does To's grandiose imagism miraculously grant this rote thriller a gleam of the sublime.
1,"To's smooth, balletic style, noirish lighting schemes and compositions are made for the big screen..."
0,Vengeance tempers tough-guy sentimentality with schoolyard existentialism.
1,You need to be one helluva director to pull off using kids' stickers as a climactic plot point; this auteur makes it look like child's play.
1,Both newcomers to Mr. To and longtime admirers should be prepared for a master class in directing.
1,Few directors make ac tion movies with the pizazz of Hong Kong's Johnnie To...
1,"Neither a call to alarm nor a laugh-at-the-loonies yukfest, the doc charts a temperate middle course through its subjects' heated rhetoric."
1,"Jones and his followers are an easy subject for ridicule, but Meyer and Neel opt for a more nuanced -- even sympathetic -- treatment of the group's ultralibertarian obsession."
0,"Instead of digging up and making sense of true information, it tracks half a dozen boring conspiracy theorists spouting balderdash and makes no effort to check out their cuckoo claims."
0,An unrelentingly tedious documentary.
1,The suspense sequences are stylishly managed...
0,"Unexciting, incoherent, lamely acted, and carelessly written."
0,Don't let the subtitle of Blood: The Last Vampire alarm you. The finale of this tedious piece of Asian-ish action-schlock based on a popular anime series implies an intention to make more. One was plenty for me.
0,"Blood: The Last Vampire might be described as Kill Bill crossed with Buffy, only that would make it sound like more than the slapdash, thrill-less dud that it is."
0,It makes sense that Chris Chow's script is based on a manga series; this is a series of 20-minute episodes in search of an arc.
0,Every scrap of footage here has been done better somewhere else.
1,"This isn't a great movie. But it's sincere as an entertainment, it looks good, it's atmospheric."
0,Often-unwatchably dim.
0,"Watch True Blood, Let the Right One In or Twilight instead. Or wait for Thirst or New Moon or Daybreakers or ..."
0,"Not only isn't the new effort up to the standards of the anime, it's bloody awful by any standard."
0,"This live-action update of a popular Japanese anime film from 2000 has a heart full of mythology, but its fangs are dulled by an anemic script and clumsy action sequences that are notable mostly for an excess of cheese, not blood."
0,"The peculiar, comic-book-like computer graphics -- artful at first -- finally overtake Blood and make it look like a video game instead of a graceful, graphic martial arts movie."

0,"This live-action adaptation of Hiroyuki Kitakubo's popular anime one-off from 2000 appears to have been made by a company of finches tweeting, ""Cheap...cheap."""
0,Hollywood movies don't get much more self-regarding than this.
1,"The characters in Thomas Moffett's script are intriguing enough, and director Jonas Pate gets sufficiently lively work from his eclectic cast, that you end up caring about them anyway."
0,"It wants to be Good Will Hunting set in the land of Entourage, but its bummed-out touchy-feeliness is every bit ?쮉s concocted as its overly jaded showbiz corruption."
0,"Not since The Informers, based catatonically on the idiotic Bret Easton Ellis book, has the screen unleashed a Hollywood abortion as dismal and dead-on-arrival as Shrink."
0,"Ultimately too cautious for even a Valley of the Dolls insider expose. It lambasts these walking movie biz clich챕s, but everyone's gotta get a happy-enough ending."
0,Full of fake moments and 'Deep Thoughts' sentiment. It's the kind of film in which people stare regretfully into mirrors a lot.
1,"Spacey gives his best performance since Swimming With Sharks, and Palmer, the young star of Akeelah and the Bee, has matured into an actress of depth and nuance."
0,"It soon becomes apparent that Shrink is exactly like virtually all [Spacey's] post-American Beauty vehicles: flashy, phony, nakedly melodramatic, and full of big actorly moments disconnected from real life."
0,Never mind the crazy cast; this weary retread of trendy multicharacter melodramas is what's really unhinged.
0,"Director Jonas Pate and screenwriter Thomas Moffett have turned this strongly cast, potentially smart tale of personal intersection among a mostly rarefied group of Los Angelenos into an irritating and unconvincing slog."
0,"Jonas Pate's derivative L.A. indie brings few fresh revelations, but it does offer this insight: There is no more juice left in the strangers-connected-by-coincidence story line."
0,"Shrink starts promisingly, but Jonas Pate directs his fine cast straight into a swamp of schmaltz as every loose thread of plot gets patly resolved."
1,"Like smog settling over Los Angeles, a creeping sense of anomie haunts the Hollywood power players and parasites sidling nervously through Shrink."
0,
0,I felt it felt forced from the first moment into the last moment.
1,A strong script from writer Thomas Moffett and stellar work from Spacey are what really make this movie work.
0,A pity-party of Hollywood narcissism.
0,The script by Thomas Moffett slickly satirizes the movie industry's fascination with vampires and special effects without being especially compelling or original.
0,"This is a movie for people who thought Crash was wise and profound, most of whom probably live in L.A. and know everything they know about life from watching movies."
0,"[Spacey's] good, but the film doesn't find an emotional center, and we're left with actors acting out."
0,"I'm not his manager, but I wonder if Kevin Spacey would profit from laying off the sardonic, disaffected, emotionally numb characters for a while. They're criminally easy for him at this point in his career."
0,There really was a much better comedy here than melodrama.
1,"Some of the humor is delicious. And there are a few fine moments of truth and pathos, most of them addressing a subset of grief often ignored on film."
0,No one knows why bad things happen to good people. But we do know why bad things happen to good film ideas. They get ruined by poor scripts and indifferent direction.
0,"Directed by Jonas Pate and written with a nice ear for self-delusion by Thomas Moffet, Shrink mixes cliches with some pleasant surprises."
0,"In seeking to depict the shallowness of Hollywood life, it's hard not to appear shallow yourself."
0,"Shrink is no worse than the average Hollywood comedy. But it shows, more obviously than most, the bankruptcy of standard-issue American pop narrative, circa 2009."
0,"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward, and when those sparks emanate from a doobie clutched by Kevin Spacey, a smug critique of the American dream is sure to follow."
0,A limply-organised multi-story snoozefest from Jonas Pate.
0,
1,"The film, expertly played by actors who look as if they know exactly what they are talking about, is a bit like a voyeur's view of the Hollywood we only hear about in scandal sheets."

1,Who needs more plot when there's so many exotic kicks to be had?
0,Over-directed and under-written trash.
0,"We're forced to listen to the sound of bones crunching, skulls cracking and throats being slit. Wouldn't it be nicer to hear some show tunes instead? For his next film, Jaa should make Ong-Bak: The Musical."
0,"Overcooked, overproduced, and all the action is swamped with distracting camerawork and gimmicky design."
0,"The pleasingly goofy personality of the first film has hardened dismayingly. This one's all rain, mud, blood and grim jungle duels, the balance tipping firmly towards bone-crunching fisticuffs rather than acrobatic stunt-work."
1,"It's... weird. But then the whole film is. Tony Jaa obviously is. But like Jaa, it's also sporadically, triumphantly, transcendently amazing. Just, be prepared..."
0,"The energy is intense, the athleticism is wild, the overall effect - pretty monotonous."
0,The movie would work better as a highlight reel.
1,"Don't look for continuity of storyline -- just enjoy the extravagant fight stunts, the restless camera work, and the sluicing rivers of blood and mud. (That's why you're here, right?)"
1,"If you've ever stood in front of a mirror and practiced your Bruce Lee ""kara-tay"" chops, Thailand's Tony Jaa should, de facto, be your hero."
0,"Unfortunately, the movie could use a bit of pachyderm memory, given its habit of flashing back to Tien's childhood with exactly the same footage used in previous flashbacks. Instead of the narrative being deepened, it keeps getting shallowed."
1,"Ong Bak 2 is slicker production-wise than the original, and it has so much noisy action that Thai foley artists must have made a fortune inserting thuds and grunts."
1,"Nourished on anemic action sequences full of shaky-cams, rapid-fire editing, and quick cutaways, American audiences are not prepared for Jaa's 20-minute essays on human bodies causing massive trauma."
1,"The fight scenes are kinetic and varied, and pick up a unique flavor from the backdrop of meticulously recreated hillside villages."
0,"Jaa, who co-directs, has only one thing in mind: a series of increasingly complex fight scenes in his characteristically wide-ranging style. If movie theaters allowed you to fast-forward past the filler, your life just might be complete."
0,Bears virtually no connection to the original.
0,"Taking co-directorial reins with Panna Rittikrai, Jaa has erected a portentous platform for his high-flying athleticism, bearing none of the freewheeling spirit or humor that made his feature debut a guiltless pleasure."
1,"There isn't much of a plot, although Jaa's fans won't mind a bit. All they want is lots of bloody, muddy action in the Thai jungles, which they get."
0,"Tony Jaa is a lot of fun to watch, but Ong Bak 2: The Beginning is not only a step back in time -- to 1431 -- but a step back in this martial artist's international film career."
1,Features a far more soulful and charismatic Jaa immersed in a ceaseless whoosh of extraordinary fight scenes involving everything from pebbles to elephants.
1,Ong Bak 2 is really just an excuse for several jaw-dropping set pieces that show off Jaa's killing skills.
1,"The denouement, far from the David-slaying-Goliath narrative that you might expect to be celebrated, is a messy affair."
1,"SThe movie is very similar to Joe Berlinger's 2009 film Crude, about similar campaigns on behalf of Ecuadorean oil workers."
0,A missed opportunity to spear corporate negligence.
1,Fredrik Gertien's documentary about the alleged perils of being a Nicaraguan banana worker has landed the director in serious trouble with the Dole Food Company.
1,"Weaving has a brilliant instinct for playing damaged men, as he did in Little Fish. Kev is a heartbreaking character, a hard-shelled survivor. Weaving captures all his brittleness, the years of damage."
1,First-time director Ivin makes a smooth transition to the broader canvas of features.
1,"A sad, standout showcase for Weaving's talents as a man whose good intentions can't fix the fact that irreparable mistakes have already been made."
1,"As Kev, the veteran actor Weaving gives the performance of lifetime."
1,"Ivin conveys both facts and emotions with efficient brushstrokes (a spied glance, an offhand comment) that are matched by an understated, evocative lyricism."
1,"Mr. Ivin doesn't have a strong narrative line to play with or become distracted by, but he takes off on some lovely detours, whether he's narrowing in on Chook or going wide to take in the world that waits beyond."
1,"Weaving, best known for The Matrix and the Lord of the Rings trilogies, brings subtlety and poignance to the hoodlum's mercurial character."
0,"Ivin's film, based on a novel, becomes too melodramatic and bleakly obvious. Weaving, though, as always, is never less than magnetic."
1,"Both Weaving and the movie itself do manage to show that this violent, hopelessly damaged man yearns to be a father, but will never know how."
1,"The Australian outback, the setting for most of Last Ride, an extraordinary film for which the locale is a quiet, almost secret catalyst."
1,"While 21st-century effects and a cutting-edge dance score make this a stunning virtual ride, the underlying concept feels as far-fetched as ever."
0,It all ends up being a half-hour too much of a just okay thing.
1,"Appropriately, the sequel suffers from almost the same problems as the original: while it's visually dazzling, thematically intriguing and fronted by the single coolest man in the universe, it's also empty, derivative and rather directionless"
1,"This reboot may not be as revolutionary as it thinks, but it's definitely worth a second glance."
1,"It is often beautiful to look at, and could come to represent the fashion tropes of its era as faithfully as its predecessor did. And the silliness somehow adds to the enjoyment rather than detracting from it. It's the best kind of bonkers."
1,"Despite dazzling man-meets-machine design and similar themes, this film does not have the complexity of Avatar and for some it may feel rather like being trapped in a long video game."
1,"It's a bit like Fast and Furious, directed by Stanley Kubrick on holiday."
1,"This is a film though that MUST be seen in a 3D cinema to be appreciated, with genuinely mind blowing visual effects, music and sound that immerse the audience in the Grid and whisk you away on a digitally delightful journey."
0,...a franchise built around the fetishistic obsession with cyber culture now preaches its evils.
0,"With a million times more computing power at its disposal than its 1982 predecessor, Tron: Legacy still looks like Disco Night at the jai alai fronton."
1,"Given the movie's graphic pizzazz, the best hippie wisdom Bridges might offer the viewer is: Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream."
1,"Both [Tron] films, made so many years apart, can fairly lay claim to being state of the art."
0,"There is no justifiable reason for such a lengthy running time, especially given that the original got in, did what it had to do and got out in about an hour and a half."
0,"There have been a number of technical developments in the intervening years, but none of them does the new film any good."
1,"As long as it's engaged in light-hurling bouts of force, or motorcycle chases through a landscape so ominously enveloping it looks like Blade Runner after gentrification, TRON: Legacy is a catchy popcorn pleasure."
0,"This 28-years-later sequel has some flash and sparkle in a few of its action sequences, but there's way too little drama or visual dazzle to justify the hype, the extra D or the film's somewhat presumptuous title."
1,"Who are we kidding? You're going for the glowing surfaces; as a Christmas bauble, Disney's $200 million production doesn't disappoint."
0,"Perhaps this is an old-fashioned notion, but if you're going to see a movie that admittedly features lots of digital bells and whistles as its major draw, shouldn't you still be able to tell what's going on?"
0,"Aside from conceptually unimaginative, the film is also derivative... and curiously humorless"
0,"Tron: Legacy shows off a world where everything is eye candy, and absolutely nothing is brain candy."
1,"The sheer size of the thing works against it: The effects are absolutely spectacular, but they blow the goofy-cheesy quotient straight through the roof."
0,"There's more than a touch of Zeus in Kevin's white beard and Olympian digs, but, much like Icarus, no one in Tron: Legacy gets to soar too high."
0,This updated story sinks under the weight of its own mystical mumbo-jumbo and pseudoscience gobbledygook.
0,"The first half hour of the film - before it shifts into 3D mode - is pacy and dynamic. After that, it gets sluggish and the visuals - as so often happens in 3D films - are far too dingy."
0,"A wash of light, colour and sound that forgoes the most basic elements of cinema."
1,"While it seems less like a parody than the original, it is also silly in a not unpleasing way. I generally have little use for 3-D, but the effects in this film are subtle and well-executed; as these things go, the least obnoxious ever."
0,"It's dispiriting to see how little attention the filmmakers have paid to the dramatic -- read human -- possibilities of the original, or how much they've been overwhelmed by technology's demands."
0,"Legacy is a two-hour light show with a lot of flash, a little style, and not one byte of narrative originality."
0,"The ""legacy'' of the title appears to be that of George Lucas. Which, of course, should be the last thing an admirer of ""Tron'' wants to see: Bill Gates taking over Apple."
1,"The special effects are incredible, blah blah blah, but oddly, the most effective element here is the original movie's striking visual design."
0,There's such a hollowness and lack of conviction within this new film's veneer of a story that it's impossible not to find your distracted thoughts bouncing around chaotically.
0,"Disney has once again constructed a digital environment out of cutting-edge special effects, only this time, it isn't merely silly; it's as dry and talky as a PBS panel show."
0,Remember the last time you yelled at your computer? It does.
0,"New players, a new story line, a new director and nearly three decades of improved technology including all the whiz-bang-wow the latest 3-D has to offer. Unfortunately, there's not nearly enough new life."
0,"Like the 1982 sci-fi curiosity that spawned it, TRON: Legacy is an ""almost"" movie."
0,"They had 28 years, and this is the best they could come up with?"
0,"If you kind of, sort of liked the ""Matrix"" franchise but found it too fast-paced, too dense with plot and way too short on neon-lit motorbike races and homoerotic Ultimate Frisbee tournaments, then I've got a movie for you."
0,"Curiously, TRON: Legacy makes the same mistake the original did: All the best stuff comes in the first act."
0,"It's a sullen affair, dominated by a grim visual palette that intrigues for about 30 minutes."
0,"It is genuinely exciting to see where this brave new world of CGI and 3D is leading. But on the whole, this isn't really much of a legacy -- or even as much fun as a round of Space Invaders."
0,"For a far more thought-provoking tale about the virtual realm, try The Social Network."
0,"It's a triumph of streamlined design, but TRON: Legacy never enters the fourth dimension where it's worth a plugged nickel to humans."
1,"Despite all the gloom and grandiosity, this can be a fun movie, particularly for those willing to sit back and let it wash over them."
0,"Tron: Legacy is the kind of sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to put me to sleep, the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli."
0,TRON: Legacy proves once again that movies can be incubators for exciting technological and F/X advances... while leaving our need for narrative unsatisfied.
0,"Another weak story with sub-B-movie dialogue, partly compensated for by intensely conceived geometric design and special effects."
0,"Lots of sizzle, not much soul, and very little sense."
0,Was it really necessary to wait 28 years for a sequel that wasn't worth attempting in the first place?
1,Director Joseph Kosinski has a recipe for adventure that should delight gamers. Non-techies are on their own.
1,"The only way to see ""Tron: Legacy"" is in IMAX 3-D, so the full visual freakiness can engulf you and be appreciated the way you used to light up at the thought of a laser show set to ""Dark Side of the Moon."""
1,"For all of its buggy storytelling, ""Tron: Legacy"" plugs into your cerebral cortex and makes it sizzle."
0,"""Tron: Legacy"" may be nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there."
0,"Like the original, Tron: Legacy obsesses over technology and style but forgets important details like character and plot."
0,"Disney may be looking for a merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film, but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script."
1,Bad things happen to good people in this intermittently effective chiller.
0,"The Canyon could be named for the gaping expanse between its preposterously silly dialogue and sturdy, at times urgent direction."
0,The Canyon is so singularly inept it gives you a whole new appreciation for the ept.
0,The Canyon is undermined by the expectation of a big payoff that never comes.
0,"The best thing about this would-be nature thriller is Will Patton's zesty performance as a cackling, crazed muleskinner, a wily old hand who exits far too soon. There's nothing much to replace him, so we're in for a long 102 minutes."
0,If well-meaning people didn't make stupid choices -- and if cellphones worked everywhere -- way fewer vacation-from-hell thrillers would probably be made.
0,"Harkema's real problem is that he doesn't know which story he wants to tell, apart from taking potshots at governments, religions and ideologies he opposes."
0,Essentially a cinematic essay that occasionally seems smart and sometimes just smart-alecky. What it never seems is emotionally engaging.
1,"Broken Hill, with its picture-postcard shots of the vast Outback, looks good and fills a niche for families."
0,It's a picture with the ambitions of a Billy Elliot but the execution of an August Rush.
0,"Scream, smash, slap, cry, repeat. The only respite: fleeting scenes of Debi Mazar as a librarian, rocking a cardigan and reading glasses."
0,"Set among the mean streets and meaner people of downtown Los Angeles, this laughably clichd dive into sexual masochism and hardscrabble survival replaces story with outline and characters with place holders."
0,"It's tough to find comedy in a dead-serious, skid-row-set film about homelessness, sexual abuse, incest and the exploitation of immigrants, but the misguided A Beautiful Life manages to provide unintentional laughs by the barrel."
0,A Beautiful Life makes little attempt to be credible or original. And the acting is poor.
0,"A Beautiful Life is nicely shot and features some appealing actors, and that's about it for the good news. The bad news is that the characters and situations are platitudes and the story is so heavy-handed that the film is hard to sit through."
0,Whatever does work here - mainly a soulful performance by Liu Ye - ultimately gets lost in the excess.
0,The film strains credulity by pushing its characters wildly to and fro with a shamelessly sentimental screenplay.
0,"[Lau] successfully balances satire and sentimentality in the first half, but loses his bearings in the sappier second part."
0,An indie-rock-scene satire (+ vampires) whose songlist vastly outweighs its laugh (let alone scare) quotient.
0,"[Not] to be confused with the current Twilight-glomming insta-spoof Vampires Suck -- but that doesn't mean it's an altogether sharper comedy, either."
1,"More slick, less subtle but still enjoyably barmy remake."
0,"Atom Egoyan's latest picture, Chloe, feels like the kind of sweatily erotic art-house exploitation flick that Bernardo Bertolucci would make on an off-day."
0,"Egoyan is fascinated by the narrowing gap between history and reality, between myth and truth, but this is a by-the-numbers drama, with no believable tension."
0,"You feel the fight go out of Atom Egoyan in Chloe, even before it becomes a straight-up Sapphic Fatal Attraction."
1,"While its European arthouse chic glosses over a less than commanding script, Chloe is nonetheless a mature, composed crisis piece that perhaps just doesn't push its audience as far as its characters."
1,"Kinky, captivating, even downright Continental: a Godard or Bertolucci plot given European-standard subtlety from Moore."
0,The general hamminess implies a low estimation of our intelligence.
0,What seemed like standard practice for Parisians comes across here as unsmiling porno-farce.
1,The cleverly constructed film manages the neat feat of containing all ingredients of a potential hit while remaining true to Egoyan's body of work.
0,Sexual suspicion and game-playing spiral down from the exotically intriguing to outright silliness in Chloe.
0,"Atom Egoyan's sex thriller Chloe is a pure guilty pleasure, if you take away that part about pleasure."
0,"Most of Chloe is plodding and drab. We're a step ahead of Egoyan's tricks, and that's because we've seen them -- all of them -- before."
0,"His recent slump notwithstanding, Egoyan remains an interesting director - one whose near-misses and outright failures retain a compulsive quality. Such is the case with Chloe."
1,"The grotesque finale aside, it's all too soign to be truly risible, but, thanks to Egoyan's trademark mix of detachment and prurience, the fun is more cheesy than queasy."
0,"With a different cast and director, this movie would be just another fuzzily lit made-for-TV movie. But because of the performances and the rather gorgeous cinematography, one is left wishing that it just could have been something more."
0,"Taking a cue from its eponymous character, Chloe skillfully seduces you, then leaves you feeling hollow and a little used."
0,Don't let the wayward Oscar nominees fool you; this sex thriller is trapped in a tepid zone between quality trash and pretentious psychodrama.
0,"Envisioned as a psychosexual thriller about a woman scorned, director Atom Egoyan's latest puzzle is just puzzling, little more than a messy affair with mood lighting, sexy lingerie, heavy breathing and swelling, um, music."
1,"A remake that's an improvement over the original, and an English-speaking women's film that, for once, beats the French at the genre they do best."
0,"The best of Egoyan's films (The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica) deserve serious attention. Not this time."
1,Egoyan keeps you wondering where fantasy starts and ends -- or if there's a fantasy at all.
0,It can't be recommended even to people who mostly just want to see Amanda Seyfried naked.
1,"Moore, Seyfried and Neeson each boast sufficient sexuality to power a single movie on his or her own. Collectively, they are the erotic dream team."
1,Its twisty plot ultimately turns into Fatal Attraction with the husbandly guilt ingeniously removed.
0,"It all goes awry in the end, but for a good stretch, Chloe neatly fixes Egoyan's career-long obsessions with identity and communication to the familiar framework of the erotic thriller."
1,Egoyan's trademark quirkiness definitely makes its presence felt.
0,"Brittle Toronto gynecologist Julianne Moore suspects her hubby Liam Neeson is cheating. So %u2013 dee-dee-dee -- she hires voluptuous call girl Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to test him. The erotic flick doesn't work for many reasons, but mainly because it's mo"
1,"Egoyan never makes a story with one level. He never reveals all of the motives, especially to his characters. He invites us to be voyeurs of surfaces that may not conceal what they seem."
0,"The only Verhoeven element that's missing is deliberate camp, a healthy ladling of which might have made Chloe worth watching for some reason other than the prospect of glimpsing Seyfried's and Moore's admirably formed torsos."
1,"This is a high-toned erotic thriller, handled with style and some emotionally raw scenes, aiming for an effect that's pleasingly unnerving, if not outright arousing."
0,"As it slides wearily into worn-out sex thriller conventions, Chloe becomes tedious and mechanical. When it's over, you're left feeling kind of cheap."
0,Atom Egoyan gets the erotic stuff right but pretty much drops the thriller part on its head.
0,"It's a ""Fatal Attraction"" wannabe with some admittedly erotic scenes--but the script is from the ""Basic Instinct 2"" playbook."
0,"Chloe descends into a preposterous third act that, by any measure, qualifies as a disaster. But it's proof of Egoyan's skill that the film works for as long as it does."
0,"Chloe may be otherwise forgettable, but it offers one of the steamier sex scenes you're likely to see at the movies this year."
1,"The film finds real sensual heat whenever Moore and Seyfried are together, and Egoyan and cinematographer Paul Sarossy turn up the thermostat by making Toronto locales seem exotic and vaguely sinister."
0,"If you've been waiting desperately for a lesbian Fatal Attraction that manages to be simultaneously slick and tawdry, your wish has finally been granted."
0,"Thanks to its stars, it may be a while before you realize how truly artificial its premise is."
0,"It looks pretty, the actors try their best, and we may have found a burgeoning star in Amanda Seyfried. Everything else presented here is worth nothing more than a few well-timed eye rolls."
1,I enjoyed because the actors don't camp it.
0,"Egoyan is an expert at isolating people, but he's less sure of himself when it comes to how they connect. So what happens to the character of Chloe is the worst kind of surprise, the ""Huh?"" that throws you fatally out of the movie."
0,"The story is the problem here, devolving into a ridiculous situation that produces far more groans than chills or thrills."
0,"Many intriguing psychological crosscurrents roil this scenario, but Egoyan too often lapses into a soft-core dreamland. The film somehow manages to be both a turn-on and a turnoff."
0,"As the film's tone moves from psychological drama to erotic arthouse thriller, slickness and absurdity overpower the playful, treacherous ambiguities it has established."
0,"Pity Egoyan didn't expend that degree of attention on sculpting a more memorable film, especially when you've got the powerhouse potential of Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore at your disposal."
0,"Chloe reminded me of Fatal Attraction, which was a believable and captivating film. This knockoff is not."
0,This exercise in inanity opens today at the U. A. Twin and other theaters.
0,"It takes a director with a true genius for disaster to put together ""SCTV"" veterans John Candy and Eugene Levy... and come up with a movie without a single laugh in it."
0,"Cool it may be, but scary (or even mildly shudder-inducing) it ain't."
1,It's good to welcome back one of the undisputed masters of modern genre cinema -- and adventurous kids will love it.
1,Dante delivers some terrific spine-tingling chills on the way towards a disappointingly overblown climax.
1,"It's the kind of knockabout, kid's-eye-view comedy-horror that hasn't been made for a while, with some nasty, frightening touches, but expertly encased in a distinctive family-movie aesthetic."
1,An excellent family adventure with its heart in the '80s and its head very much in the now.
0,The return of director Joe Dante would be more welcome if his children's horror-thriller weren't so tepid.
1,No one understands that giddy rush of sugar buzz cinema better than director Joe Dante.
0,"All the elements are here, they just don't add up to a satisfying whole."
1,"The film is alternately hilarious, insightful and sad, and entirely allergic to sentimentality or easy platitudes."
0,"[Features] a slack, scattershot approach that ill serves the director's intermittently audacious film."
1,"Drop the impotent Michael Moore-esque expos on the company who manufactured the drug, and this moving doc would, in fact, be perfect."
1,An exemplar of fresh-air filmmaking that addresses the devastating legacy of the drug thalidomide with acidic wit and grumpy honesty.
0,"The film tastefully handles the sensitive subject, but it lacks the bite that a Michael Moore would have provided."
1,"A darkly funny and fascinating examination of body image, sexuality, and self-esteem."
1,Potent and wisely straightforward.
1,"An explicitly antiwar conclusion unwisely makes the grim focus feel like a bias, but the power of the interviews makes one wish for more stories, not fewer."
1,"Avoids preaching to the choir, though perhaps only the choir will attend."
0,"Has important things to say. Sadly, it does so in an unexciting manner."
0,"A film whose benign-sounding title and Veterans Day release give a false impression of what it actually is: an attack on the military, drenched in blood."
1,"High Life is filled with surprising, artful flourishes."
1,"The plot gets twisted but the direction by Yates never does. He finds the humour in a desperate situation. It's hard to hate or even despise Dick and his stooges, because you can sense how needy they are."
1,"An eye-filling travelogue, an exciting adventure and a very funny film."
1,"The movie has not aged well. To its credit, it is benign and charming, with an intoxicating musical score, compelling cinematography and a continually advancing locale."
0,An interminable travelogue interspersed with sketches in which star-spotting affords some relief.
1,Is the whole thing too exhausting? It's a question of how much you can take. We not only took it but found it most amusing.
0,Proof that you can buy an Academy Award.
1,"With a smash lineup of stars in major and minor parts, Todd has turned out a surefire hit."
1,"The wonder is that this Polyphemus of productions does not simply collapse of its own overweight; but, thanks principally to Showman Todd, the picture skips along with an amazing lightness."
0,"With its lazy, somnambulant pace and endless stream of cameos, Around the World in 80 Days seems to be unfolding in real time."
1,"Outstanding in the long part of Mr. Fogg's faithful valet, Passepartout, is Cantinflas, a sad-faced comedian with a delightful economy of gesture and expression, who adds just the right note of implausibility to the whole highly improbable affair."
0,An unconvincing if not exactly unwatchable tale of two polar-opposite brothers.
0,"With The Fall, writer-director John Krueger buries a promising neo-noir plot with ponderous pacing and uneven performances and dialogue."
0,K찼ri's smug little arthouse offering ends up covered in Nicholas Sparks goo.
1,The Good Heart dilutes Cox's gravitas with quirk.
0,"Abetted by a thin story line and episodic screenplay, The Good Heart never goes anywhere important, but director Dagur Kri creates a spellbinding ambience."
1,"If you're in the mood for a splash of dark drama, a bit of humor, very dry, on the rocks, with a twist, this will come close to satisfying."
0,"Cox's character is a living, hissing embodiment of the idea that no good deed goes unpunished. As an actor stuck in a movie that wastes his talents, Cox can surely relate."
0,"No amount of splenetic ranting by Brian Cox, a wonderful actor, when given the right role, can salvage The Good Heart from terminal mawkishness."
0,The movie begins to wear out its welcome even before a conclusion of breathtaking corniness.
1,"Iceland-bred writer-director Dagur K찼ri shot most of the picture in his homeland, loading a lot of distinctly Nordic seriocomic melancholy onto a study of two characters in a city that never sleeps."
0,"But the film has no grasp of reality. And, worse, it has no feel for poetry, settling for pat contrasts between the two men, and taking its cardiac imagery to an absurd and literal conclusion."
0,"A hangover toast to an old New York with original wood paneling, cassette tapes and indoor smoking"
0,"Cox has some wonderfully funny moments, but both actors are playing heavily to type-Cox the irascible bull, Dano the soulful dormouse - and there's a lot of shouting and hurling stuff into the street."
0,"As robust and clever an actor as Cox is, he can't make Jacques any less of a blowhard; Kari's wit simply doesn't come through in English, at least with this script."
0,"I will not -- I must not -- tell you what happens at the end of this movie, except to say I was stupefied that anyone in modern times (i.e., since 1910) would have the gall to sell such cornball at retail."
0,This odd couple never moves beyond oddness and the lower-depths shenanigans grate.
0,"It's a strange thing, this type of whimsy. Kari offers us ideas in place of characters, and yet he expects us to see through these ideas to the real-life conditions they represent -- and then to respond to them in kind."
0,"Cox doesn't so much chew the scenery as inhale it. Dano looks on in awe. Who can blame him? For that matter, who can blame Cox?"
0,"The movie's two bright spots are Cox and Dano, who perform excellently despite the dull inevitabilities the script forces on them."
0,"Credit Broderick and the cast for putting across the fey Indiewood bullcrap with committed, nearly convincing effort."
0,"More impoverished than the budget is Wonderful World's script, a shopworn tale of redemption in which the constantly outraged, pot-puffing misanthrope learns that ""magic is everywhere."""
0,The story never fully blends the idea of Singer's rediscovery of his artistic voice -- and even something as simple as why he was a children's performer in the first place is never addressed -- with his personal renewal.
0,A paint-by-numbers tale of redemption for a man whose wounds are mostly self-inflicted.
0,"[Lathan] finally has a showcase, yet doesn't have a full character to play."
1,Matthew Broderick adopts just the right attitude for his role in Wonderful World.

1,"The movie is unfailingly likable and finally impressive. Goldin doesn't settle for easy answers, and he makes you think that no one should."
0,"It's all very sincere, but watching a dweebish depressive learn that Life Is Good is a lesson of diminishing returns."
0,"Despite a film festival pedigree (it was shown at a number of local festivals on the 2009 circuit), the movie is so lightweight and inconsequential that a review seems almost superfluous."
1,"The movie itself is a little too tidy, a little too determined to convey a lesson, but the character sticks with you."
0,"While this movie is earnest and well-intentioned, it doesn't quite work."
0,Not quite good enough.
1,"If ... Wonderful World seem(s) a little tired, the film still has its own low-key pleasures, thanks to Broderick's restrained performance and a script that punctuates the inescapable saccharine of its storyline with tart little bursts of anger."
1,"By faithfully documenting Ruppert's long-simmering analysis, Smith lets us experience the feeling of a world gone to pot, whether or not the claims are factually accurate."
1,"It's not a pretty picture, but it is not a naive one either. The grippingly articulate Ruppert is like Noam Chomsky as a wry pundit of doom."
1,"While [its] totally impartial approach is admirable, it also robs Collapse of any invested sensibility."
1,"There are many layers to the man and the movie, and it's hard not to leave the theater shaken."
0,"It would have been helpful had Smith put his words into some sort of context, allowing others to assess his theories. Instead there's simply Ruppert, talking, raging and warning, as if his very life depended on it."
0,"Collapse is boring. But what do you expect from a one-sided movie about a kook, who, at the time the film was shot, faced eviction from his home because he hadn't paid the rent?"
1,Not just sobering; it's a full-on assault.
1,"Collapse"" is a grueling peek at a doomsday prophet's rigorous mind but in a sly way also a compassionate look at the strain Ruppert endures from knowing he has only ever been right."
1,"Collapse will leave you shaken about the future of the planet, and saddened about the shattered life of the messenger."
1,"There is controversy over Ruppert, and he has many critics. But one simple fact at the center of his argument is obviously true, and it terrifies me."
1,"Ruppert unexpectedly breaks down, weeping openly for the lost future of humanity, and at that moment I was startled at how bad I felt for him -- and how nervous I was, suddenly, that this contemporary Cassandra might just be right."
0,It's only when he starts to weep for the future of a population that won't heed his warnings that Ruppert shows his humanity. It's made him abandon his cause and quit writing.
1,"Rich on rhetoric, if sometimes a little loopy in the ideas beneath."
1,"Chris Smith's documentary centres on a long and disquieting interview with Michael Ruppert, a radical American activist on a mission to expose the ""peak oil"" cover-up..."
1,"Smith treats Ruppert both as exhibit and patient, and he comes across as an angry yet compassionate man, secure in his convictions but lost in his emotions."

1,"If he's even half right, the world our children and grandchildren will inherit doesn't bear thinking about."
0,
0,We've seen how they run. Now see if we care.
0,It's not one of Sparks's more inventive efforts and Cyrus's extended sulk doesn't exactly enhance her acting prospects. Not that this means much.
0,Kinnear lends the movie a dignity it doesn't deserve and stands as the only cast member whose dramatic moments aren't propped up by soaring musical cues.
0,"It's not a great film, with some edge Sparks put in the novel left out of the script. But there's real chemistry between the young lovers."
1,"[Cyrus is] believable as Ronnie partly because she, too, is 17 and at a crossroads in her life."
0,"For those wondering if the continuing popularity of such exercises might make this one worth the ticket price, the same effect might be achieved by writing names and obstacles (make some tragic) on index cards and tossing them in the air."
0,"It's not surprising that in the hands of a first-time director and first-time screenwriter, nobody in this movie behaves like a recognizable human being, but it is surprising that Cyrus comes across as such an unlikable sourpuss."
0,"Huffing through the early scenes of The Last Song with black leather boots and a frozen pout, Miley Cyrus plays author Nicholas Sparks' idea of a rebel, which is to say Ned Flanders' idea of a rebel."
0,The Original Nicholas Sparks Romance Factory accomplishes its goals. The New Miley Cyrus Acting Company falls a bit shorter.
0,"Cyrus is ghastly in The Last Song, bad not just in one or two ways, but in all kinds of ways. It was a disservice to the audience, to the material and to Cyrus herself that she was put in this position."
0,The predictable plot mechanics aren't what make it insufferable. The big problem is Miley Cyrus.
0,"Cyrus is game and appealing, but she's not nearly enough of a natural actress to pull off the emotional whip-cracks the story puts Ronnie through."
0,"Cyrus, alas, hasn't yet learned not to act with her eyebrows and overbite. But she does show off her considerable chops as a pianist and remains reasonably likable throughout."
0,"It's the worst of both worlds as Disney cash cow Miley Cyrus makes the most dubious ""dramatic"" debut of any singer since Britney Spears."
0,"It's hard to believe this bland starlet is the same spunky kid who bounced through the Hannah Montana movie just last year, but it's only fair to cut Cyrus some slack."
0,"The director, Julie Anne Robinson, makes sure that any scene that might culminate in thought or reflection instead becomes a montage set to music."
0,"A dramatic showcase for a more grown-up Miley Cyrus, but not much more."
0,Perhaps feel-good tragedy doesn't quite capture it; feel-good sadism might be more like it.
1,"Robinson is a sympathetic director of actors, allowing almost everyone their dignity. For the most part, she keeps this emotionally charged story in the schmaltz-free zone."
0,All the obvious elements combine to manipulate the audience into a weepy time at the movies -- again.
0,"Sand dunes at sunset, summer lovin' (had me a blast!), a third-act medical crisis and a clutch of letters designed to be read aloud in voice-over: Another month, another adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance."
0,"It can't manage to sort through its various issues in any dramatically compelling way, instead falling into a slack, soap-opera rhythm in which potentially catastrophic developments seem to have no lasting emotional effects."
0,I like Miley Cyrus. I like her in spite of the fact that she's been packaged within an inch of her life.
0,"In case you wondered: Little girls still scream for Miley Cyrus. You too may experience the need to scream, albeit for different reasons, should you take one (or more) of them to see The Last Song..."
0,Maybe Douglas Sirk could have made something profound out of the pseudo-ennobling horsepucky.
0,So bad it makes The Notebook look like Casablanca.
0,"This is Miley's vehicle, but the strongest scenes are between Kinnear and Coleman."
0,"Years on the Hannah Montana TV series have not adequately prepared Miley Cyrus for screen acting, even in a vehicle as unchallenging as this adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel."
0,"It's like Dante and Beatrice all over again, with the Georgia coast standing in for Paradise."
0,"Sadly, without a single note of originality, Last Song is an awfully long and tiresome tune."
1,"The movie moves Ms. Cyrus from where she was to more or less where she and her handlers wanted to be, and Mr. Kinnear's musician father, Steve, adds a generous measure of grace."
0,"'Clunky, one paced and mostly off key' not only describes Hemsworth's intentionally bad singing in The Last Song but also the film."
0,"Anyone but Cyrus fans will find this one of the more inferior Sparks adaptations -- and yes, that includes Nights in Rodanthe."
0,"The ""last song""? In all conscience, that should really have been Billy Ray's Achy Breaky Heart in a brooding minor key. You'll feel the ache and hear the break."
0,"As Nicholas Sparks adaptations go, this one's both endearingly join-the-dots and surprisingly un-crass."
1,"Here's the revelation: Miley Cyrus is a really interesting movie star in the making, with an intriguing echo-of-foghorn speaking voice, and a scuffed-up tomboyish physicality (in the Kristen Stewart mode) that sets her apart from daintier girls."
1,"Hardwired as we are to respond to infants, it's difficult not to be drawn in to the innate cuteness. The filmmaker's emotional connection to his subjects is clear, and even when ""Babies"" loses steam, it casts the human story in a fresh light."
1,"An exercise in observational cinema tracking four infants across the globe, Babies is refreshing in its methods, impressive in its scope and remarkable in its immediacy."
1,"For the most part, the strength of Babies is the way it babies babies babies babies babies universality babies babies babies, babies babies babies miracle babies babies."
1,"Crying, peeing, grinning, crawling (there's a brief crawling montage -- the one such gimmick), the babies in Babies offer moments to cherish. Frankly, though, the film itself is kind of slack."
1,"With no narration, no subtitles and little language at all, this makes for a charming visual contrast in the ways of getting a child through that first year of life."
0,Babies is barely more insightful than your average Flickr photo gallery or home movie clip: it's just infant porn for prospective parents.
0,There is almost literally no difference between watching Babies and just watching a baby.
1,"The film's message is loving and clear: we all created equal, even if some of us have better access to diapers."
1,"The photography is stunning, and Bruno Coulais' music adds just the right soundtrack to this intriguing visual diary."
1,"Face it: This is very, very cute stuff. There will be cooing in theaters, and a desire to reach out and scoop those kids off the screen."
1,"As an advertisement for the wonders of figuring out how to be alive, the movie is an engaging proposition."
1,"In the joyous and buoyant new documentary Babies, the filmmakers keep the baby -- and the bathwater -- and everything else about infants that makes them so appealing that the rest of us keep making more of them."
1,"By showing these vastly divergent parenting styles and domestic situations, Babies can't help but ask whether Western and first-world cultures have gone too far, and become too controlling, when it comes to child rearing."
1,"Equal parts travelogue and big-budget home movie, Babies is an intriguing look at the universal nature of life, albeit a longer look than it needed to be."
0,Say this for Babies: No one can leave complaining they didn't get what the title promised.
0,"""Babies"" is, in the words of screenwriter David Mamet, ""as cute as a pail of kittens."" It is also shallow, squirmy and painfully contrived ..."
1,"The filmmaker shot nearly all this footage himself, all on a tripod. The stillness of the lengthy moments that result can be mesmerizing."
0,"As a diversion, Babies is like a wind-up toy that will tickle anyone with a pulse. As a documentary, it's like a cache of home videos that will frustrate anyone with an inquiring mind."
0,"Imagine one long, stupefying montage of all the home videos you've ever had to watch of your friends' tiny offspring, edited without any narrative arc or discernible point of view, and you'll have the gist of this misbegotten documentary."
1,"The film entertains, as far as it goes. I wonder, though, if it goes far enough, or says much of anything beyond ""Hey, check these babies out."""
1,"Did I like the movie? Aw, yeah, I did. How could I not? Did I feel I needed to see it? Not really."
1,"Really, it's a nature documentary, except that the topic is human nature and the subjects are the only humans on the planet whose behaviour is unaffected by the camera."
1,"Blessed with no narration, an absence of gimmickry and an embracing love for its subject matter, Babies is as sweet, joyful and filled with curiosity as a you-know-what."
1,"Babies begins to gain telling traction as the small triumphs start to come faster toward the sixth-month mark. Things begin to look up once the infants begin to, well, look up."
1,"Watch a baby for a while and chances are you'll be entertained. Multiply that times four and you have BabiesM/em>, a documentary as funny, charming and un-self-conscious as its subjects."
1,"Might restore your faith in our perplexing, peculiar and stubbornly lovable species."
1,Babies is a celebration of the gloriously mundane.
1,Everyone tells you how to raise a kid -- this doc shows you how to feel like one.
1,"Babies is a mesmerizing and weirdly manipulative experience, combining wide-eyed innocence and shrewd cultural commentary as it chronicles the folkways and familial rites of four starkly different societies."
0,"The cry of a baby is ruthlessly, evolutionarily designed to be one of the most irritating sounds on Earth. So why would you want to hear it (many times) on massive movie theater speakers?"
1,"Watching babies learn and grow is the true joy of the movie. Whether they're clapping along at play group, splashing in streams or struggling not to fall asleep, the babies are the stars of this sweet, amusing little film."
1,The parents from Mongolia should travel around the world to demonstrate their superior swaddling techniques. Never has wrapping a blanket around an infant looked more like a work of art.
1,The movie is pleasing -- who doesn't love gurgling babies? -- but as anodyne as a series of episodes from America's Funniest Home Videos.
1,"Presents itself as an ethnographic meditation on the first year of life but is better approached as an ""oooooh"" and ""awww"" fest..."
1,"A simple idea, but very nicely done by French documentarian Thomas Balms."
1,"The kids are absolutely charming, and each scene is beautifully shot. But there is no narrative thread, and the minimal social observations are blindingly obvious."
0,"A disappointing, trite comedy overrun with African-American stereotypes."
0,"The script is never nearly as clever as the premise ought to allow, and the madcap fun is far too frequently derailed by tonal inconsistencies."
1,"It's comforting, really, to see the movie's soft-pedaling of actual ghetto problems; realism isn't Lottery Ticket's game."
0,"Even on its own limited terms, the jokes are sub-Friday sequel, and a last-act grab for Boyz n the Hood pathos is seriously reaching."
0,"If any of the central characters in Lottery Ticket had a bit of sense, the movie would be over in about five minutes."
0,"The comedy is broad, bordering on offensive, the laughs are few, and the positive message feels tacked on."
1,"Like Kevin's lucky fortune cookie, Lottery Ticket is a sweet treat with a substantive message."
0,"White and writer Abdul Williams are determined to squeeze in some social commentary. And while this, too, is mostly familiar stuff, a couple of bits do resonate."
1,A formulaic comedy that's enlivened by the high spirits of its supporting players.
1,"Like Barbershop, The Lottery Ticket is about a community as much as it is about a lucky young man who gets in over his head."
0,"There are a couple of good performances and a few funny bits, but mostly the film just bounces back and forth until coming to a flat, trite close."
1,"If Lottery Ticket had as much conviction as laughs, it could have hit the jackpot."
1,"You know what? This movie's good. It's fast, deftly paced and funny, and only some misjudged violence in the last lap keeps it from being better than good."
0,"It all comes off a bit like an extended episode of ""Everybody Hates Chris"" with really bad language."
0,"Let's call it four out of six numbers, with no power bonus. Some payoff, but don't quit your job."
0,"...a film that's largely wealthy in incoherence, raising a smile one minute and a cringe the next, until it finally devolves into a 'who-cares' clich챕-fest."
0,A jumble of comedy and drama with a sprinkling of After School Special messaging and some head-scratchingly bad choices.
0,There's a one-in-a-billion story to Lottery Ticket: Those are the approximate odds against a script this bad making it out of the introductory seminar at film school.
0,"Though the movie looks good and rarely lags on energy, the careless script is filled with tired stereotypes and easy clich챕s."
1,"Erik White and Abdul Williams don't reinvent the wheel of fortune in Lottery Ticket, but the director and screenwriter, respectively, deliver a well-plotted, energetically paced story."
1,"A big, vivid supporting cast - including Faheem Najm (a k a the rapper T-Pain) and the comedians Charlie Murphy and Mike Epps - is a strong asset, as are messages about sexual responsibility and charity in the 'hood."
0,There are enough stereotypes in here to get Dr. Laura frothing at the mouth -- and enough menace to merit co-writing credit for the Hughes brothers.
1,"No doubt the characters are stereotypes, but the performances are handled with a knowing wink and a great deal of fun."

0,It's hard to imagine any romantic comedy going wrong in so many different ways.
0,A bicoastal comedy with a bit of a bipolar disorder.
0,Romantic comedies aren't written any more. They're compiled - cut and pasted together from bits and pieces of old Judd Apatow and Nora Ephron bromances and chick flicks.

1,[It does] that one thing that a romance absolutely has to do -- touch us.
0,Just because you tart up a typical romantic comedy with trash talk doesn't make it edgy or real.
1,"To date, no motion picture has adequately captured the soaring highs and devastating lows associated with a long distance relationship, but Going the Distance comes as close as any movie has."
1,"The long distance aspect was interesting, accurate, and mined for maximum comic effect."
1,Captures the harshness and the sweetness of our time.
0,"Going the Distance is a reminder of the sorry state of the rom-com, where gross scenes and easy-to-write trash talk have replaced smart dialogue."
0,"This premise, with better writing, could have made a much more compelling movie."
0,"An R-rated romance that has its moments but is ultimately trying a little too hard (something Barrymore, with her trademark lightness, never does)."
0,"A foul-mouthed rom-com carved from Apatowian intent, but it feels more like a sketch of a movie than the real thing."
1,"There's rat-a-tat dialogue in ""Going the Distance,"" but it's kept small-caliber, and the film does not kid itself -- or us -- about how much hard work is required to keep a flickering flame of feeling alive in the face of a big, cold world."
1,The film gets many things so right about the conflicts faced by a two-career couple looking for work in a shrinking economy.
0,"There's just not quite enough to the movie: not enough jokes, not enough obstacles, not enough sex."
1,"Between this movie and her fascinating performance in HBO's Grey Gardens, Barrymore, at 35, is becoming a serious comedic actor."
1,"It all looks so effortless, it's a wonder that movies like Going The Distance are such an anomaly."
1,"There's also some gallows humor about the record and newspaper industries, but overall this is a light, genial comedy about denial and self-defense."
0,"Barrymore and Long are both appealing, but not enough to sustain audience interest in the cinematic equivalent of dry-humping."
0,The couple-surrounded-by-quirky-friends dynamic is as obvious as the movie's New York locales and well-positioned indie band posters.
0,"There is not much substance to Geoff LaTulippe's screenplay, which mostly falls back on Apatow-style sex jokes and pop-culture riffs."
1,Screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe's story of a recession-era long-distance relationship and its hurdles takes its characters seriously.
0,"In terms of tone and style, the finished product ends up all over the place: Think of it as the Sybil of romantic comedies."
1,"Going the Distance may be a minor movie, but it's also the rare romantic comedy in which you can actually believe what you're seeing."
1,The film's constant raunch factor balances out its romantic center in a way that will likely surprise and please many.
0,Particularly forgettable.
1,"Acknowledges both the difficulty and the comic potential of the arrangement, and does so with enough insight and charm to make you wonder why frequent-flier love is not a more popular theme in romantic comedies."
1,"It's filthy, funny and kind of sweet, if not quite up to the level of Judd Apatow's oeuvre in the burgeoning field of R-rated comedies with heart."
0,It smothers the already frail story of their characters' long-distance relationship with enough R-rated gross-out humor for half a dozen Judd Apatow movies -- except that virtually none of it is funny.
1,"It's a solid but totally forgettable entertainment, redeemed somewhat by Barrymore's loud, horsey laugh and some agreeably racy comic situations."
1,Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have a believable chemistry that makes Going the Distance worth going to. More or less.
0,"This empty, immature romantic comedy ultimately feels as if it's filled with all the hot air that separates New York and San Francisco, yet still manages to be a suffocating bore."
1,What's both refreshing and problematic is that there's no emotional imbalance between boy and girl: their feelings are mutual and the obstacle is purely geographical.
0,A long haul.

0,"With pratfalls and teardrops, the film swings from sitcom to sit-dram."
1,"What you may not expect is quite how satisfying much of the film is, with Duhamel turning out to be a very good sparring partner for Heigl, whose lush, soft exterior conceals a very spiky interior that tends to wilt her co-stars."
0,"Formulaic, shallow and sinfully tedious from start to finish."
1,"It's brisk, pleasantly acted, painless. These days, that's high praise."
0,Veers not an inch off Hollywood's well-worn rom-com path.
1,The supporting cast serves up enough small moments of surprise to keep this formula flick from falling flat.
0,"Pity any poor kid stuck in a house like that. Pity, too, anyone who has to stop by for a visit."
0,The Heigl/Duhamel hostilities are so persuasive their entire movie balls itself up into a shrill domestic nightmare.
1,"Life as We Know It turns into a reasonably honest consideration of what it might mean to have to honor the dead by raising their living, breathing, pooping, screaming progeny."
0,Credulity is stretched throughout.
1,"This is a change from what audiences have come to expect from the usual Heigl vehicle. She's quicker-witted and warmer than usual here, and she keeps Duhamel on his toes, even when the storyline drags its feet."
0,"Sometimes I suspect there is secret high-stakes contest in Hollywood among filmmakers to try and come up with a movie without a single original idea. If so, Life As We Know It is a contender..."
0,"So anyway, what happens in Life As We Know It? You'll never guess in a million years. Never."
0,The title becomes a depressingly self-fulfilling prophecy: This is movie life as we have all come to know it.
0,"Watching Duhamel and Heigl discover the joys and pains of parenthood is cute as far as it goes, but their story can't progress too far until the kid is out of diapers."
0,"It aims for comfort food, but ends up with leftovers."
0,"Yes, there are some twists, a nice comedic turn or two, but the inevitable hook-up of dueling opposites is never anything but inevitable."
0,As disposable as one of those diapers.
0,There is not a single deviation from formula.
0,"Cloying and at times annoying, Life as We Know It is egregiously manipulative, whoring itself out for a few unearned tears."
0,"""Life"", in this context, is pushing it. How about instead ""desperate contrivance that unites two people who thought they hated each other""?"
1,"If innocuous entertainment, amiable enough while it lasts but forgettable beyond, has a place in life as you know it, then Life As We Know It will have a place in your heart."
1,"Just like the clunker you end up buying and liking in spite of everything, Life As We Know It gets you there. Exactly where is hard to say, but chances are you won't regret making the journey."
0,"Basically, this is The Taming of the Shrew with an adorable-baby twist that never occurred to William Shakespeare."
0,"Whose life are we talking about, exactly?"
0,"We keep seeing Heigl's potential as a fine comic actress and, the curse of optimism, continue to be disappointed when she betrays her best instincts."
0,"Pure Hollywood corn, saccharine and sour by turns."
1,"This is the first produced script from the writers and they find more flexibility in this story than I expected. There is space for depth, drama and real life."
1,"Despite the film's initial overloading of suburban stereotypes, the easy gags about promiscuity, baby vomit and nappy changing gradually give way to a pretty decent, if strictly formulaic, yarn about commitment and unexpected life changes."
0,You've probably had bloodier encounters with a vegetable peeler.
0,"Frozen delivers enough thrills and gory chills to satisfy the horror film crowd, but is not written, directed or acted well enough to be a first-rate thriller."
0,"Since the plot literally has nowhere to go, Frozen is basically a waiting game."
0,Green also can't maintain the suspension of disbelief necessary as we watch three charmlessly written characters bicker and attempt inane ideas.
0,These three are so dull the story might have had more spark and tension had Green stranded three strangers aloft on a frozen chairlift.
1,"Calm and jaded as I am, I was left so paralyzed with terror by this movie that I chewed a whole pencil in half watching it."
1,"The film moves along, in its paradoxically static way, at a pretty fair clip. I look forward to Green's follow-up."
0,"The excess of conversation never succeeds at humor, but it does make us hate the characters, whose speech seems to have just two modes: bickering and whining."
1,"An entertaining, suspense-filled, sometimes wonderfully grotesque little scarefest."
0,Where are the flying Saint Bernards when you really need them?
0,"Frozen has its work cut out for it, since the main characters are so annoying you initially pray for an avalanche to just get it over with."
0,"Green definitely knows his way around a suspense sequence, but he needs to find a way to work those sequences into a movie that has its own organic life, and isn't so... well, please refer back to the title."
0,This chilly thriller from Adam Green (Hatchet) starts with a nifty premise and goes nowhere from there.
0,"Frozen is good for five minutes of ""What would you do if?"" games. Then it's just stiff as a board."
0,"A stuck chairlift just doesn't exert the same primal terror as a roiling sea, and to make up the difference, Green would need a better cast and sharper dialogue than he has here."
1,"In those moments when we (and the characters) are paralyzed between bad decisions, we're as stiff with tension as an icicle."
0,Another date movie-horror flick designed to scare tentative couples into each other's arms.
0,"Tthe script is clunky, the acting strained. Too bad. Underlying the life-and-death thriller are notions about the ways coupledom changes and challenges friendships."
0,The performances and what passes for dialogue -- mostly extended bickering and screaming -- are so lackluster that it's hard to care about the fate of this trio for long.
1,"Taking a dramatic turn from the slasher hilarity of his breakthrough feature Hatchet, writer/director Green plays it straight with a script that has the virtue of simplicity."
0,"Adam Green's Frozen explores a tiny idea exhaustively, and I mean exhaustively."
1,A nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart.
1,The threesome's constant conversation amid the building unease helps establish them as characters with which the audience can identify.
0,There's not enough here for 90 minutes.
1,"Adam Green's taut, toe-curling survival thriller is better than it should be: the concept and the characters' behaviour are mostly plausible, the script is dark and funny, the acting is adequate, and the wildlife scenes are convincing."
1,"What would you do, suspended 40 feet above hard-packed snow, with only the wolves for company if you dare to jump?"
1,"The taut set-up is enjoyable all by itself, but it's the rising tide of three-way recriminations and despair that gives this film emotional clout."
1,It's a stunt film that only just overcomes the challenge it's set itself.
1,"This minimalist thriller offers the same endurance-test nightmare as Open Water, only here the imperilled characters are marooned on a mountain, and wolves substitute for the sharks."
1,"Fiendish, sweaty and tense as hell. One to watch through the fingers."
1,Green orchestrates all this with some skill but not too much gore. A minor tour de force.
0,
1,"Frozen is a tour de force, not because of exceptional performances by the actors, but rather the outstanding directing of Adam Green, who also wrote the script. The script gave Green a limited area within which to work, and he carried it off superbly."
0,"Despite a fascinating midpoint revelation, Reed spends too much time capturing her sibling's terrifying outbursts, devoting the film's final act almost exclusively to his increasingly abject circumstances."
0,"Instead of pushing deeper into any psychological dilemmas, this dirty-laundry doc gets lost in a sensationalistic flurry driven by a serious emotional unraveling."
1,Well-crafted and intense.
1,Anybody who has ever doubted that truth is stranger than fiction should see Prodigal Sons.
1,This is fascinating.
1,I love the set up of this one.
1,"Sometimes we forget that when documentary filmmakers begin a project, they don't always know what they'll be filming because, to state the obvious, real life doesn't work from a script."
1,A consistently generous film.
1,"Kimberly Reed started out to make a movie about starting over, but then life got in the way. It didn't make her job harder. It made the movie better."
1,The problem with family-diary documentaries is that some families have too much drama for just one movie.
1,"At the heart of Prodigal Sons, a family drama in the form of a succinct, eloquent personal journal, is a sibling rivalry whose reverberations touch upon the very essence of human identity..."
1,A film that will fascinate inquisitive viewers on multiple levels.
1,What actually happens is less important than the barest glimmers of that old Polanski magic.
1,McGregor hits all the right notes as a man with a conscience and sense of professional pride who is in way over his head.
0,"Polanski simply transfers Harris' undistinguished prose direct to the screen and, though the pace picks up marginally in the second half, there's little wow factor in the revelations as they appear."
1,"A well-made, sleekly retaliatory, pleasurably paranoid tale..."
0,"Overall feels uneven, sprawling and strangely incomplete."
1,Shows Polanski in brilliant command of a political thriller that ties you up in knots of tension while zinging politics and showbiz like two sides of the same toxic coin.
1,"The Ghost Writer is a reminder that, regardless of his real-life problems, Roman Polanski can still craft compelling thrillers."
1,"A tight, taut, witty and highly theatrical entertainment, shot in shades of wintry gray, that will keep you guessing right through its final fadeout."
1,"This is the 76-year-old Polanski's first contemporary thriller in two decades and his first film in four years. It's an intelligent and deftly honed return to the genre, blending a contemporary plot and classic structure."
1,A dark pearl of a movie whose great flair and precision make it Polanski's best work in quite a while.
1,"The Ghost Writer may not go down as one of Polanski's masterpieces, but if it does end up being his swan song, it's the ideal denouement to a life and career of unsettling resonance."
0,"McGregor turns in his best work in recent memory, and Polanski's an expert at building the sort of intense atmosphere that leaves his audience in a state of edgy paranoia."
1,"The intrigues, suspense, and reversals that follow this setup are best left to unfold at their own stately clip."
1,"From the second it begins, The Ghost Writer signals directorial authority and precision, subtly codifying the film's existential style and substance."
1,"Mr. Polanski's work with his performers is consistently subtle even when the performances seem anything but, which is true of this very fine film from welcome start to finish."
1,"Mr. Polanski is a magician, his movie a synthesis of Mr. Harris's sturdy narrative, a Mamet-like appreciation for the shadows that lurk between words, and a drollery that most directors wouldn't even think about attaching to a thriller."
0,"Roman Polanski, you are the mayor of Chutzpahtown."
1,"It's a brilliantly made, paranoid, leftish political thriller. And it's also the first great film of the year."
1,"[Polanski has a] knack for taking pulp and transforming it into tense, paranoid drama."
1,"This is a nice, stripped down, spare, modest little thriller."
1,This is a real triumph in tone.
0,"Considering that it's been more than a decade since The Ninth Gate, you'd think Polanski would have had more in store."
1,"Doesn't demand much from the viewer, but its smart dialogue, nimble syncopations, and tricky suspense are - while you're there in the theater, in the dark - thoroughly satisfying."
0,"The mystery is unraveled a bit too conveniently, and the fatalistic Chinatown ending feels more rehearsed than revelatory."
1,"Polanski at 76 provides a reminder of directors of the past who were raised on craft, not gimmicks, and depended on a deliberate rhythm of editing rather than mindless quick cutting."
1,"Like the Swiss clocks that must have watched over his editing suite, Polanski's flick ticks away relentlessly -- at 128 minutes, the film doesn't make us impatient for a second."
1,The Ghost Writer is minor Polanski but it's one of the rare thrillers these days that plays up to you instead of down.
1,"Brosnan and Williams are the real highlights, both such dynamos that you feel their absence and yearn for their return during the long stretches when McGregor is mucking about on his own."
1,"Brosnan, long past his James Bond days, has ripened as an actor; he's outstanding."
1,Polanski infuses the action with the quality of a waking nightmare. He has the capacity to take a simple shot of a ship coming into harbor and give it a feeling of foreboding.
1,"From the chic austerity of the Langs' undisclosed location to the gradually revealed nexus between academia, politics and corporate influence, The Ghost Writer offers an unusually astute glimpse of power at its most alluring and corrosive."
1,"The best thing Polanski has done since the seventies, when he brought out the incomparable Chinatown and the very fine Tess."
1,"It's not one of Polanski's masterpieces, but The Ghost Writer doesn't dilute his reputation as a master of suspense."
1,"Another director would almost certainly have bobbled this devilish mixture of paperback suspense, political chicanery, and jet-black comedy. In Polanski's hands, it's an unholy pleasure: a diversion that stings."
1,"As an exercise in craft, it's surprisingly successful, thanks to the strong cast and the vivid depiction of a modern leader's security apparatus."
0,"The result is a political thriller refreshingly long on grown-up dialogue yet lamentably shy on, well, thrills. This chatty thing does go on."
1,"The swirl of visual poetry, political intrigue and personal zeal that Polanski creates gets under your skin and brings an icy hand up your back. This is moviemaking."
1,"Polanski is in total command of his medium, something that hasn't been a sure thing since the 1970s, The Pianist notwithstanding."
1,Polanski's most enjoyable film for a very long time.
1,The thread of black humour that runs throughout the film compensates for its occasional moments of madness. It's a film just silly enough to be taken deadly seriously.
1,"The script shows butterfingers habits when it comes to narrative detail, and the final revelation holds little interest. But Polanski's approach is always magical. Even when diluted, it casts a potent spell."
1,Whether or not Polanski fully grasps the moral of his own excellent film remains to be seen.
0,[Contains] a series of fundamentally dispiriting moments that are seemingly insulated from criticism by the Polanski brand.
1,The film will probably be better remembered as a faithful screen adaptation of the Robert Harris political thriller.
0,"It is good to see Polanski exercising his gift for the sinister. It's a spooky world he evokes here but its architecture doesn't hang together, which is a great pity."
1,
1,The dialogue and suspense created by director Polanski are first rate. You will enjoy this film.
0,"Another wholesale dystopian future, just like the last one."
1,"The movie goes completely insane, in the best way possible."
0,"It's an intriguing premise, one director Miguel Sapochnik treats with all the subtlety of a head smashed in with a typewriter. Hey wait -- that happens!"
0,[Repo Men] just turns into a grisly one-note chase thriller...
0,"This is not a bad cast, but whatever wit the script aims for is lost in the queasy details director Miguel Sapochnik found more fascinating."
0,Why good actors like Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber have taken major roles in this wrongheaded effort is perhaps the most compelling question posed by this film.
0,"Repo Men sets up and puts into motion an attention-grabbing premise, and then, for the most part, just goes to typical places with it."
0,"There's a key organ missing from the movie itself: a brain. In its place is a memory bank of other, better movies."
0,"Under the uncertain direction of Miguel Sapochnik, the actors often seem at a loss...The inconsistency of tone is impossible to ignore."
0,"I watched a third of the movie through the cracks of my fingers, wincing."
0,This is the sort of science fiction that opts for scissors to the groin or a bullet to the head rather than a complete thought.
0,"It's a time-waster with brains, but ultimately not enough brains, and one that wastes too much time."
0,This is a long-delayed sci-fi slasher flick that the relieved producers are now tossing like a malodorous Molotov cocktail into the middle of our national health care debate.
0,"I don't know if the makers of this film intended it as a comedy. A preview audience regarded it with polite silence, and left the theater in an orderly fashion."
0,Let the 2010 Razzies race begin!
0,"This ultra-gory speculative noir is, at its infrequent best, certifiably nuts; the rest of the time, it's one numbingly brutal slog."
0,Alternately smirking and dully disgusting.
1,"Repo Men, rough though it is, is disturbing enough, funny enough and shocking enough to work on some weird level."
0,"As a recession-era satire, Repo Men strikes a very bitter chord."
1,"Still, despite its flaws, this ambitious parable is enjoyable, and sometimes viscerally moving."
0,"Repo Men is basically a soulless slasher flick, and one that demeans its gifted performers."
1,At least a robotic handclap is due to director Sapochnik for working within his limitations (including obvious budgetary ones) and giving this Frankenstein beast as much forward momentum as it possesses.
0,Repo Men is a rare film where Toronto plays itself. It's also the first I've ever seen where a typewriter is used as a lethal weapon.
1,"One can forgive the movie's defects, and its indecision about being tragedy or comedy."
0,It's a film to be endured more than experienced.
0,"The slicing and dicing is unsparingly full-on, but it's the gruellingly slow pace which really does this in."
0,"It's tough to recommend Repo Men outright, but you could do worse when trolling multiplex halls."
0,"There are plenty of moments when the appearance of a flying, green-glow Chevy Malibu would be a welcome distraction."
0,Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. It's a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.
0,"The script, ambitious and inept in similar quantities, tries to work the set-up into an allegory for cosmetic surgery, immigration and the credit-based economy, adding a dash of confusion to the general atmosphere of callousness."
0,"Great stuff at first, but when Law grows a conscience and goes underground with the uninsured, the narrative excitement slumps."
0,"One of the worst endings of any film, ever. Seriously. Ever."
0,The overused homages and a tacked-on twist ending are just failed attempts to save Repo Men from its own shallow blood lust.
1,Better and smarter than you might expect.
0,"This was too long, mean, and gory for me, though the satirical gloss and well-executed trick ending will probably impress some."
1,"Despite the blood and gore, 7 Days is a cut above the usual splice-and-dice horror festival, but it's not for the squeamish or fainthearted."
0,"Director Grou lacks the gene for sheer, bloody exploitation, he also doesn't know how to rack up the tension and get under viewers' collective skin."
1,"A funny, fantastic, genuinely alarming quasi-autobiographical cheapster by twentysomething New York brothers Josh and Benny Safdie."
1,Seamlessly strung together with a funny-sad tenderness and a gliding casualness that's more purposeful and believable than the unrefined improvisations of most DIY cinema.
1,"A risky, heartbreaking exercise in empathy toward a person who may not deserve it."
1,Has a certain dark charm if you can put up with very jittery camera work and editing.
1,"At first glance, the laughing, wisecracking, adventure-promoting dad in Daddy Longlegs seems like a parent any kid would love to have."
0,
1,"It's heartrending, and it wouldn't be heartrending if it weren't authentic in its texture."
1,"The episodic, well-acted tale has a strange kind of charm."
1,"At its best, this beautiful, off-the-cuff comedy-drama recalls John Cassavetes' shaggiest, most honest work."
1,"Daddy Longlegs may shock you, but it will also make you reexamine your ideas about parenthood, and what it means to be a father."
1,Daddy Longlegs is all jangly and raw. The hand-held camera is almost as much of a presence in the film as Lenny is.
1,"The Safdies deserve respect for surviving their childhood, if not for making a film about it that refuses to amuse or indict."
1,"Bronstein's loose-limbed performance as the brash, irresponsible father of two young boys establishes him as a genuine triple threat."
1,"If Daddy Longlegs is influenced by Cassavetes, well, that's not a bad thing. Few filmmakers have the nerve to travel that path."
1,"Most directors are, in fact, inspiring performers who reserve their performances for cast and crew; Bronstein is among the most self-unsparing and inspired of them, and his performance in the movie is a treasure."
1,"Hitchcock would have loved it, even wrapped in the Safdies scruffy enigma of a movie."
1,"The film's grungy, ultra-low-budget look, thanks to the Safdie's handheld camera, is just right for catching the crummy, hardscrabble, rat-infested milieu."
0,
1,An absolute knockout.
1,"Every once in a rare while a movie gets inside your head and heart, rubbing your emotions raw. The remarkable Winter's Bone is just such a movie."
1,"For all the horror, it's the drive toward life, not the decay, that lingers in the mind. As a modern heroine, Ree Dolly has no peer, and Winter's Bone is the year's most stirring film."
1,Lawrence gives a guarded and watchful performance.
1,"Lawrence is the movie's blooming discovery, a mesmerizing actor with a gaze that's the opposite of actress-coy and a voice modulated in the low, almost monotone cadences of local ways."
1,"Winter's Bone is raw, real, understated, fiercely intense and surprisingly gentle and decent amid bursts of ferocity in the rural crime culture where the story's set."
1,"Winter's Bone sometimes feels like a haunted house, where only extreme deference to scary people will save you."
1,"Spectacular for its humanity, austere beauty and heart-stopping urgency."
1,"Following its brave heroine (an outstanding Jennifer Lawrence) as she seeks to uncover the truth behind her father's disappearance, the film employs the structure of a whodunit to take a tough, unflinching look at an impoverished Ozarks community."
1,"Intense, immersive and in control, Winter's Bone has an art house soul inside a B picture body, and that proves to be a potent combination indeed."
0,Grim backwoods tale takes its time building momentum.
1,"Every so often a film gets under our skin with its haunting authenticity, reinforcing our faith in the wonderfully transporting power of cinematic storytelling. Winter's Bone is unquestionably that film."
1,"Granik has no taste for noir archness, opting for a chilly, shot-on-decaying-locations naturalism that feels as lived-in as Lawrence's performance."
1,A coming-of-age story that is not entirely about breaking free.
0,The main reason for Winter's Bone to exist is that it delivers a little voyeuristic thrill -- a bit of poverty porno -- for the critics who awarded it their highest honors at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
1,"Granik makes something real out of all of it. And even, against all odds, hopeful. Because, yes, this is a hard and stony land. But the life that manages to take root there tends to survive."
1,Winter's Bone is a welcome reminder that thrillers don't have to be loud and boisterous to grab the attention and keep it captive.
1,This lead performance [from Jennifer Lawrence] is excellent.
1,"The dialogue is so sparse and the plot is so lean in Winter's Bone, it requires acting of exemplary strength, and the movie delivers in spades, chiefly in the performances by Lawrence and Hawkes."
1,"The gritty, desperate Ozarks milieu of Winter's Bone feels so real, so right, that you only slowly realize you're watching a detective movie."
1,"It's been a long time since a film has conveyed a culture, and a sense of place, with such telling precision. At the same time, Winter's Bone thrums with suspense."
1,Winter's Bone is the best film of the year.
1,"The social detail of a 21st-century mountain community is completely persuasive, heightening the drama immeasurably."
1,"The way Lawrence captures a young woman's fear and resolve, often non-verbally, well ... this is a considerable talent well on her way to a great career."
1,"There is a hazard of caricature here. Granik avoids it. Her film doesn't live above these people, but among them."
1,"This is a world out of time and, despite the trappings of flinty realism, the film too unfolds like an elemental myth from the stormy past -- a Greek tragedy driven by dark fates and struggling toward a catharsis."
1,"For Jennifer Lawrence, she's probably the most gifted actress of her generation. How wonderful that, so young, she has already found a role worthy of her talent."
1,"With Winter's Bone, Granik has morphed from a director worth watching to one who demands our undivided attention. She's got mine."
1,"The result is a film and a character of unusual strength. Pity Ree, question her decisions, wonder about her future. But the girl does not quit."
1,Jennifer Lawrence gives a stirring turn in a gift-of-a-lifetime role.
1,A masterpiece of sparseness.
1,"Both a whodunit and a coming-of-age tale, dominated by Jennifer Lawrence's luminous performance as the resourceful, much-tested Ree."
1,What we've been waiting for: a work of art that grabs hold and won't let go.
1,"Winter's Bone is a genuine triumph, a great movie with astounding performances so natural, so genuine, that you forget it's a movie."
1,This unblinking look at America's Red State Crystal Meth Belt is an instant Southern Gothic classic.
1,"Granik balances the pace and intrigue of a mystery thriller with total compassion for Ree, played with much skill by Lawrence."
0,"Like a Botoxed face, the movie never shows an interesting wrinkle or passion-attesting lifeline."
1,"There is poetry here -- as artists as diverse as Walker Evans, James Agee and Harry Smith have found -- of the rawest, most desperate kind."
1,"It is all given unironic dignity and power due to the outstanding lead performance from 20-year-old Jennifer Lawrence as Ree, a young woman who must take on some scary neighbourhood types to protect her family."
1,Think a film like Trash Humpers offers insight into a crappy life in the poor South? Winter's Bone will make you see the light.
1,"The film, adapted by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, establishes a formidable tension between mystery and matter-of-factness."
1,The Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou? was the last film to make such delirious use of mountain music. The rest of the world can start drooling over Lawrence. I'm gonna git me a copy of that soundtrack.
1,"A rewarding, richly detailed exploration of the strength of character required when confronted by ugly truths."
1,"Debra Granik's bleak little film is as tough, unflinching and fascinating as the characters who eke out a life amid its cold, gray hills."
1,"Sparked by wonderfully lived-in performances from Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo, ""The Kids Are All Right"" is alright, if not up to the level of writer-director Lisa Cholodenko's earlier pair of new bohemian dramas."
1,This love letter to gay-marriage supporters is respectably entertaining filmmaking.
1,"It's so real, so sexy, so sad, so honest and so truly, heartbreakingly funny."
1,"Guided by an outstanding script, everyone is able to go deep into her or his character. Particular huzzahs are due Bening for the precision she brings to the brusque yet emotionally expressive Nic."
0,There are not only glancing moments but whole sequences in this movie when the agony of social embarrassment makes you want to haul the characters to their feet and slap them in the chops.
1,"The title, like Nicole Holofcener's Please Give, is one that trails you out of the theater and gives you something to brood on."
1,"The film's main strength is the screenplay, co-written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg. It's perceptive and mercurial, perfectly in tune with the churning tensions within every family."
1,"The actresses are loose and funny, trading off big scenes and clearly enjoying themselves throughout."
1,"Whatever the facts of your own family life, you're likely to see some of it reflected in this wonderful movie, which you should see as soon as you can."
1,No film has left me with a fuller sense of satisfaction this year so far.
1,Kids makes its own special magic. It's irresistible.
1,"Cholodenko and her cast turn what could have been an utterly artificial story into a warm, funny, sharp-tongued and broiling examination of the volatility underlying even the happiest of families."
1,The director alternates incident-laden storytelling with penetrating character moments that her terrific cast acts to the fullest.
1,"Touching and funny in their upheaval, the people in The Kids Are All Right open the door to a brand new examination of family values that leaves you charged and cheering."
1,"It's a movie about basic things, about the meaning of family and the vulnerability of families, with the suggestion that the ones most subject to bombardment are the families least protected by custom and tradition."
1,"The basic joke here, and it's a rich one, is that the dynamics of gay marriages differ little from those of straight marriages. But that joke also serves as a catalyst for some startlingly beautiful considerations..."
1,"Kids may sound like typically quirky arthouse fare. But this is a movie for everyone -- and, in one way or another, about everyone, too."
1,"This gem features five topnotch, multidimensional performances in one of this summer's most engaging films."
1,"The best thing about the film is its bigheartedness. It's not out to mock these people, but rather to show how any person of any orientation can become unraveled when high-minded principles meet with base human instincts."
1,"An intimate, funny, occasionally upsetting depiction of a loving family that is, like so many families, often only just functional."
1,"Witty, urbane and thoroughly entertaining."
1,"Plenty of movies strive for topicality, but occasionally something like The Kids Are All Right slaps you in the face with the world you're actually living in."
1,"""All right"" doesn't begin to describe it ... the easiest movie to love I've seen all year."
1,"It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal."
1,"The Kids Are All Right is the movie we've been waiting for all year: a comedy that doesn't take cheap shots, a drama that doesn't manipulate, a movie of ideas that doesn't preach."
0,"Somewhere around the halfway mark, the realization arrives with a dull thud: Turns out that unconventional families can be just as tedious in their melodramatic dysfunctions as any traditional clan."
1,"The performances are all close to perfect, which is to say that the imperfections of each character are precisely measured and honestly presented."
1,"The Kids Are All Right might not be as edgy as Cholodenko's past work, but this more mainstream effort has lots of smarts, lots of heart and an open mind."
1,"The specifics of the story only underlie its general, and universal theme: Marriages and families can be hard work -- and kind of worth it."
1,"Cholodenko's film stands as one of the best American films of the year precisely because it's willing to look at what love truly gives, and what it truly takes."
1,"Movies like The Kids Are All Right -- beautifully written, impeccably played, funny and randy and true -- don't come along very often."
1,"The acting in this film is so good, across the board, that it doesn't feel like acting; we're simply watching a family going through some drama (and comedy) over a summer before its eldest child leaves for college."
1,"Directing from the tart, laugh-out-loud script she cowrote, Lisa Cholodenko (Laurel Canyon) has crafted an honest, generous portrait of the challenges of American family life -- gay or straight."
1,"Cholodenko understands that the family, any family, remains a primal source for drama that is both mirthful and maddening."
1,Cholodenko and cowriter Stuart Blumberg have crafted a loving work about family that will resonate as true for those who find their experience reflected on the big screen and will be revelatory to others.
1,A comedy of modern manners with the texture of a great short story.
1,"Just about everyone who has been a parent, child or partner will find resonance in its bittersweet depiction of the joys and trials of lifelong intimacy."
1,Here are five gifted actors at the top of their games as five characters in search of what makes a family.
1,It's a terrific film.
1,"Definitions of family, love and friendship all get put to the test with wit and warmth in The Kids Are All Right, one of the year's most honest and endearing films."
1,"Sophisticated and funny, but once you get past the unusual premise and the fact that the main couple is realistically portrayed, there's nothing surprising about it."
1,Common to all Cholodenko's films is a fascination with the mayhem that can result when the chronically stitched-up come up against the amoral and fancy-free.
1,"Funny, aching, rueful -- often at the same time -- The Kids Are All Right makes most mainstream releases this year seem decadent by comparison."
1,"The film gets better and better, powered by a sharp, wise script and superlative acting."
1,Family-centric comedy has never felt so fresh.
1,"A witty portrait of postmodern family life in which script, casting, direction and location all just float together without any apparent effort at all."
1,"This is a much better made, more persuasive film than The Switch or The Back-Up Plan but just as much about wish fulfilment, and no more honest about conflicts that can leave the kids far from all right."
1,"Piercingly funny, subtle and moving."
1,Its emotional pull remains consistent to the end.
1,Blitz's fundamental embrace of human eccentricity shines through in a film that glows with optimism even as it reveals the dark side of a miracle.
1,
1,A sophomoric comedy with honor-roll style and smarts.
0,"There's a certain relentlessness to the film's stoned vibe that gets under your skin, but it's far from enough to make up for the project's dreary mirthlessness."
0,"Spurts of loony inspiration aside -- Chiklis rivals Animal House's Dean Wormer for pure hissable self-righteousness -- this is mostly all reefer, no madness."
0,Surely this could be a fine premise for an entertaining stoner flick. It isn't.
0,"Once the plot has sprung into action, ""High School"" is a bumpy ride that takes a few amusing dives but never coheres into anything special."
0,"Somehow, High, directed by newcomer John Stalberg, lured serious talent, including Adrien Brody, Colin Hanks and Michael Chiklis. Even odder: They're the worst actors of the bunch."
0,"Lacking real kick, ""High School"" winds up as irksome as a bag of ditch weed and as lame as the pun of the film's title."
0,"Brody's performance won't earn him a Oscar to place next to the one he earned for The Pianist nine years ago, but it's the only thing that makes High School marginally worth catching."
0,"A silly stoner comedy boosted by a few unexpected tweaks, John Stalberg's debut is more notable for its enthusiasm than its originality."
1,It's exactly what it appears to be: a funny-enough stoner comedy with a likable cast.
0,Can audiences who've seen the Harold & Kumar films and watched Method Man and Redman smoke John Quincy Adams' bones in How High settle for so little?
0,"""High School"" is a pun. Get it? This is one of those stoner comedies that may be funny if you're high - but if not, not."
0,"If it ever opens at a theater near you, remember: Just say no."
0,"I'm betting director John Stalberg Jr. also debated calling it ""Bake Sale,"" revolving as it does around the mass-dosing of the student body with pot brownies."
0,The only good news for everyone involved: The worst moment in your career is surely behind you.
0,"It's a bit crude, a lot illogical and you might have to be in a certain state of mind to enjoy a film this silly."
0,High School sucks harder than it blows.
0,A stoner comedy with a slightly musty vintage aroma.
0,Two missing children stories are combined to less than compelling effect in this sluggish thriller.
0,"In the lead-up to the inevitable connection, Anderson builds suspense around innumerable close-ups of telephone touchpads, liquids being spilled, [and] Lucas straining to be a credible hayseed."
0,A technically polished thriller marred by textbook filmmaking that grows increasingly dull as the plot wears on.
0,[A] graceless piece of tragedy porn...
0,Anders Anderson's thriller struggles to intertwine the two mysteries and ends up doing justice to neither.
0,"The low-boil mystery-thriller Stolen was once known as The Boy In The Box and then Stolen Lives, but now has a title as nondescript as its contents."
0,"Plays like a middling episode of Law & Order: SVU, drawn out an extra half-hour and embellished with pretentious literary and cinematic flourishes."
0,"Though generally ham-fisted, Stolen may appeal to Hamm's more die-hard fans."
0,"No one is able to make much of the disposable script, but Hamm is so limited by the period trappings that it seems as if he simply wandered onto the wrong set."
0,"Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but technically polished, with inspired performances and enough suspense that by the time Mr. Hamm found the redemption that freed him from his own demons, I was so wired I needed a Valium."
0,"A leaden murder mystery with a clunky structure that swings back and forth between 1958 and 2008, Stolen wastes the talents of a reasonably good cast."
0,This gravely serious drama is as insular as a tomb with Muzak.
0,"The film has no pulse and feels interminable, with its stilted dialogue, static staging, and usually fine actors who are horrendous here."
0,"Mark Young's bargain-basement thriller is as witless as the captor's motive; to paraphrase another well-dressed Madsen psycho, this little doggie barks, but it has no bite."
0,"What dribbles out is a series of repetitive, dull, clichd showdowns until most of the cast is gruesomely dispatched and the twist-that-isn't-a-twist is revealed."
0,A spectacularly boring chamber thriller.
0,Strains to wring tension from a tired premise and an airless script.
0,"There's little fun involved, for either the audience or the diner patrons."
0,"As subtle as a face-punch, La Mission nobly continues a necessary conversation about homophobia, but paves the way to hell with its own good intentions."
0,"The warmth comes through, even if the storytelling is simplistic and clichd."
1,"Bratt's performance suggests enough subcutaneous rage to give the proceedings an edge, even when the sluggish narrative takes the slow-cruise ethos of its low-rider culture far too literally at times."
0,"The movie might suffice on late-night cable, but it is hardly worth big-screen prices."
1,"Benjamin Bratt brings his A-game to a difficult, potentially clichd role."
1,"Observing the phases both father and son endure as they try to forgive and prioritize in order to survive makes La Mission a poignant and unusual film, one that you won't soon forget."
0,The problem is that the screenplay to La Mission should never have gone before the cameras in this condition.
0,La Mission feels more like Sundance fodder from 20 or 25 years ago than something with much relevance today.
0,"I don't require acceptance and reconciliation, and La Mission is forthright in avoiding easy answers. But does the screenplay shortchange Che by painting him more broadly at the film's end than he seemed at the beginning?"
1,"This is the sequel that John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 original deserved, as director Nimrod Antal delivers enough hard core sci-fi, explosive action and monster mayhem to justify its belated arrival."
0,"An unnecessary reboot of the 1987 cult movie. Quite literally every image, every idea in Predators, is a straight steal from another film."
0,"As a fan of Schwarzenegger's macho, heart-of-darkness original, it gives me no pleasure to say that Predators is an uninspired mess of mediocre action scenes strung together until the final reel."
0,"A stolid, uninspired imitation of the original..."
0,What starts with so much promise and intrigue devolves into a more predictable cat- and-mouse game. The fascination wears off as the initial premise never becomes fleshed out and plot holes loom larger than the monstrous mayhem.
1,"Antal leaves the door wide open for a sequel, which is good news for fans of the genre. But please, don't invite the Alien to the party."
1,Predator purists (is that an oxymoron?) have nothing to fear: This is a worthy follow-up.
0,"After so many iterations in every possible medium, the Predator series needed a shot of vitality, not another workmanlike go-around."
1,"Antal is a professional who respects your dollars. In a season where the blockbusters are as flat as month-old soda, that's the most romantic gesture a commercial filmmaker can make."
0,More is not necessarily scarier in this often lively but scattered reboot.
1,"It's a dumb action movie in a summer full of dumb movies, and yet it's always entertaining. And you won't really miss Arnold at all."
0,"It lacks the quiet suspense of the first Predator, and please don't even mention the Alien vs. Predator pictures, which lacked the subtlety of Mothra vs. Godzilla."
0,"None of this is scary, and nothing makes sense."
0,"There isn't anything as comically grisly as the exploding head or Carl Weathers' arm removal, both well-remembered moments from the original Predator."
0,Predators needed more predators.
1,"It has fun showing us that humans can, indeed, be the most dangerous game."
0,Predators mostly just suggests a bunch of grown-up men playing with toys and not bothering to invite the rest of us into their circle.
0,Some genre movies simply work out this way: Whatever their intentions or origins they percolate for about an hour. And then they sputter and hope that a promising first half will be enough to get by.
0,"The dialogue is dumber than dirt, and the plot crumbles at the halfway mark, but the movie does what a loud summer blockbuster should, which is loudly bust blocks."
1,"A stylish, lean and, well, familiar outing."
0,"This chaotic stew of fire, blood, mud and explosives is so devoid of terror and suspense that any metaphorical analysis is rendered moot."
0,"Predators is just another movie-machine, running on action formula."
1,"Predators is good if gory grindhouse fun. It tweaks the conventions of the summer monster movie, even as it observes them."
1,"After 23 years and three attempts, Predators finally delivers a solid sequel to the Arnold Schwarzenegger B-movie classic."
1,"Predator fans, fearing another lapse into disappointment, can relax. Although it's arguably not saying much, this is the second-best movie of the series to have ""Predator"" in the title."
0,"Predators tries to spice up the hunt-or-be-hunted thesis, but from the get-go, director Nimrod Antal's movie has nowhere to run."
1,"It's silly, bloody fun."
0,"Predators is a pretty good action movie for about 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it lasts 106."
1,"All these years after Predator, these decades past the classic film, Most Dangerous Game, that inspired this genre, it's good to see the idea of the hunter becoming the hunted still gets the blood racing."
1,Antal is a good enough action director that some of the combat is pretty exciting.
0,"At the midpoint... it got more and more confined, claustrophobic and flatter."
1,"The odor of musty, late-'80s nostalgia may still hover around this already threadbare brand, but you simply don't see movies that leave both the curious and the fans who truly care this viscerally satisfied anymore."
0,The memories of those who were definitely there during those momentous days in late June are undeniably powerful... But are their voices best served by the messy documentary in which they appear?
1,"Cohesive, well-structured docu from veteran filmmakers Kate Davis and David Heilbroner boasts a panoply of found footage, graphically positioning the uprising as a flashpoint following decades of repression."
1,Stonewall Uprising methodically ticks off the forms of oppression visited on gays and lesbians in the days before the gay rights movement.
1,"This all-new assemblage of rare home-movie footage, photographs, and gripping testimony from people who were there -- including one of the cops who led the raid -- allows us to experience a landmark civil rights event in a fresh and fascinating way."
1,"The filmmakers do a good job of laying out the whos, whys and wheres through diagrams, reenactments and testimonials from veterans on both sides of the skirmish."
1,"Stonewall Uprising is first and foremost about people. Politics and history and sexuality are there, too, but they're subsidiary to the human stories the documentary tells."
1,"The directors score a coup in getting testimony from the police officer who led the raid, a now-elderly gentleman who freely confesses the fear that rippled through his unit, and his regrets in having been on the wrong side of history."
1,The great strength of Kate David and David Heilbroner's Stonewall Uprising is its rich context.
1,"Many witnesses offer emotional recollections of the ensuing riots, but equally powerful moments come courtesy of old footage, in which anti-gay ""experts"" expound with a confident ignorance that sounds chillingly familiar even today."
1,Fascinating doc provides the story of this pivotal moment in gay rights.
1,Stonewall Uprising is an important documentary -- and a passionate and compassionate reconstruction of the historic standoff between police and pubcrawlers.
1,"On the one hand, Stonewall Uprising shows how far we've come toward enlightenment and tolerance since that hot June night. On the other, it reminds us that there are still many minds to change and rights to win."
1,Pplaces the incident within the context of the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s with PBS-caliber tact and compassion.
1,It comes alive through the memories of those who were there.
0,"For a movie about a groundbreaking gay rebellion, Stonewall Uprising plays it much too straight."
1,"In its roundabout way, this usefully meandering documentary probes the enduring stain of Guantnamo on its victims and on America."
1,"What emerges is an illuminating, though terribly dismaying, portrait of the War on Terror's lasting effects."
1,"[Director Laura Poitras] goes to great lengths to inject surprise into the narrative, strategically withholding information, including the double and triple meanings of her title."
1,Poitras's movie digs deep; it hints at the violently conflicting drives that an intelligent human being may be liable to.
1,Just how deep inside Jandal's world Poitras goes is all the more striking given the inherent cultural barriers and danger she faced as a female filmmaker shooting a former Al Qaeda operative in Yemen.
1,"A documentary that at its start purports to be the tale of two terrorists, the film keeps deepening and widening until it becomes a subtle, stubborn moral drama about users and the used."
0,"The essential information in The Oath could have been boiled down to 30 minutes, but the good parts are indeed good."
1,The Oath makes spare use of images to convey a great deal. Al-Bahri's smiling child is surrounded by lethal weapons that are little more than toys to him. The color-drained skies of Guantnamo are juxtaposed with the lively Yemeni street scenes.
1,"Poitras has opened up a fascinating window into the minds of the people who hate us, apparently not so much for our freedom as for our arrogance, our belief that we are the center of the universe."
1,
0,More entertaining in concept than execution.
1,"The acting is effective, the direction by Alexandre Franchi is confident, and the cinematography by Claudine Sauve could hardly look more assured."
1,"Mr. Gordon's screenplay is full of funny things, and it's beautifully paced, but it's the performances that give the picture its true classiness."
1,Only someone with a heart of stone could fail to love a drunk like Arthur Bach.
0,Overrated one-joke comedy.
0,"So little care has gone into the characterizations, the structure, and the situations that the film merely feints at significant comedy."
1,Moviegoers are hereby alerted to some good fun.
1,"Arthur is a sparkling entertainment which attempts, with a large measure of success, to resurrect the amusingly artificial conventions of 1930s screwball romantic comedies."
1,"One of those rare contemporary entertainments that can be used to contradict people who habitually complain, ""They don't make 'em like they used to!"" This time they have."
1,"Sackler reframes education reform as a moral issue, and it's impossible to look at the fallen faces of kids turned away from a school -- of all things -- and disagree."
0,Advocacy to the point of propaganda.
1,"Director Madeleine Sackler favors an agenda of advocacy over complexity, making The Lottery an effective, if unapologetically one-sided, piece of agitprop."
0,"Though infinitely classier -- and easier on the eyes -- than Cartel, the recent documentary exploring public education, this latest charter-school commercial is no less one-sided."
0,"Charter schools, good or bad? That's the question raised by director Madeleine Sackler's timely but standard documentary The Lottery."
1,"The film takes an effective, two-pronged approach to tell its enlightening tale."
1,"You look at all these beautiful kids, with all the potential in the world, and every expectation for a great life, and you know that at most one-sixth of them will come out of the room with a fighting chance. That shouldn't be."
1,
1,Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement suggests that he may one day be a director to rank with Don Siegel.
1,One of the most effective exploitation movies of the decade.
1,Novelty of a gang swearing a blood oath to destroy a precinct station and all inside is sufficiently compelling for the gory-minded to assure acceptance.
1,Hopelessly violent but exceedingly well made.
1,
0,"If nothing else, a horror movie about cabbages could help Rosenberg work through his obsession and save a lot of analyst's fees."
0,"Unfortunately, two nice effects can't save a movie this relentlessly slapdash."
0,"a flat, stagy, artificially cheerful affair that falls far short of the memorably creepy Laurel and Hardy version of 1934."
1,"The movie is built as a series of more-or-less self-contained episodes, and the episodes that work are worth the effort."
1,"A naturalistic, irreverent and sometimes broadly comic view of a largely ignored aspect of the Civil War gives Bad Company a refreshingly good name."
1,"Benton's first film, a Western good enough to make everything he has done since seem disappointing by comparison."
1,Bad Company is an excellent film which combines wry humor and gritty action with in-depth characterizations of two youths on the lam in the Civil War west.
1,"[Ritchie] directs scenes for comedy even in the face of his disturbing material and that makes the movie all the more effective; sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we can't, and the movie's working best when we're silent."
1,[Ritchie] keeps the sentimentality in check most of the time and obtains first-rate performers from his miniature cast all of the time.
1,"Amiably engrossing satire on the 'win ethic' that offers a take-it-or-leave-it approach to its serious points about enforcing precociousness on kids, but consistently delights with its panoramic comic invention."
1,Michael Ritchie keeps his dead-end cynicism in check and produces a genuinely funny comedy about a Little League team managed by a lovably drunken Walter Matthau.
1,An extremely funny adult-child comedy film.
1,"Surprisingly, improbably, The Bad News Bears is the year's funniest movie."
1,"A film was released that got everything beautifully, hilariously and even painfully right."
1,"At a time when sports movies can't be just sports movies anymore, it's both startling and soothing to take a second look at Michael Ritchie's Little League comedy The Bad News Bears."
0,"Overlong, stiff, and about as suspenseful as a detergent commercial."
0,1956 was way too soon for an unfettered treatment of the central premise.
0,"Mervyn LeRoy, who produced and directed, has lost a great deal of the bite of the play."
0,This melodrama about a child with an inbred talent for homicide is pretty unpleasant stuff on its own.
0,Director LeRoy has been overly faithful to the play script.
1,It is one of those rare instances in which close adaptation of a good book has resulted in possibly an even better movie.
1,Never before has a movie considered the game from the inside out.
1,"A funny, gentle and honestly sentimental movie that is easily one of the best of the year in any category, and very possibly the best movie about sport ever made in this country."
1,"The material is trite, but Hancock's slow-motion treatment of the experience of athletic performance is adroit and graceful."
1,"There's a low-key, melancholy feel to the film, thanks in part to De Niro's turn, which never patronizes his character or begs for sympathy."
1,Heartbreaking and heartwarming.
1,"The baseball version of ""Brian's Song"" has reduced more than a few tough guys to tears."
1,"By the end, you've taken a fastball in the gut without even knowing how it got there."
1,I remember [it] leaving a really deep mark on me as a kid when I saw it.
1,"The movie sometimes loses track of its story and rambles for puzzling stretches of unfocused scenes. But it succeeds best with the breezy, warm scenes of baseball life and with such sterling character bits..."
1,It depicts a handful of men in the Battle of the Bulge with as much realism as Hollywood can muster.
1,One of the most magical of all films.
1,Endures as an improbable dreamscape that marries the apex of cinema to a classic fable.
1,A magnificent fairy tale.
0,"The film is all surface, and undermines its own don't-trust-a-pretty-face and anti-greed themes at every turn."
1,It's a magical passage to a more impassioned and bewitching era.
1,"A daring artist, working in a difficult time of shortages and old equipment, convened 'a little village of workmen' and packaged a dream for the ages."
1,"Studied or not for philosophy, this is a sensuously fascinating film, a fanciful poem in movement given full articulation on the screen."
1,Cocteau's fairytale set standards in fantasy which few other film-makers have reached.
0,Unduly slow pace and repetitious use of trick sets hurts chances of this film.
1,"A sublime, sumptuous film directed by Jean Cocteau with the help of Rene Clement."
1,"When bodies appear through walls or fly up into the air, it is almost as if Cocteau's camera has miraculously recorded a dream."
1,"Children, as well as adults, may find the atmosphere dangerously addictive."
1,"If the first act of La Belle et la B챗te showcases familial insecurity in all its ferociousness, the second part, which actually involves a monster, is amazingly peaceful, full of surrealist cinema tricks and haunting mise-en-scene."
1,Beauty is fragile. Magic is rare. And it's precisely the blessing of the cinema that it affords us such opportunities to indulge in fantasy.
1,"""Beauty and the Beast"" remains a profound exploration of the human and animal worlds, light and darkness, and love and art."
1,"What's mesmerising about Cocteau's film is the seriousness with which it regards the fairytale material, combined with an eerie, dreamlike production design that's more effective precisely because it's more real."
1,"Quietly moving and exquisitely made, suffused with a depth of feeling that belies its minimalist construction."
1,"Despite the weighty title, this is an extremely light, delicate art film that rarely makes a false move."
1,This portrait of an introverted soul brought out of her shell is not without its charms.
1,"Hamer's style is what might happen if Ulrich Seidl liked people, with immaculate balance in each shot, but the emotions in focus, as well."
1,"""1001 Grams"" achieves a charming equipoise of levity and gravity, of formal rigor and soulful sentiment."
1,Gorgeous cinematography balances impeccable acting and directing for a romantic trifle that delights with design more than content.
1,A quirky meditation on the weight of the soul. Depicts a reality bathed in such absurdity that it feels like fantasy.... The film is caught between moments of great storytelling and a distended metaphor.
0,Such a rouser that it almost makes up for the incomplete passes and stopped runs that precede it.
0,"... what it really resembles, more than anything, is a teen comedy populated by adults."
0,
0,"Betrayed is a film that left me in turmoil, torn between the strong sympathies I felt for the characters and the fundamental doubts I had about the plot."
0,"The filmmakers end up with a jarring, often suspenseful movie that, ultimately, misses the mark."
0,
0,"People running into each other can be funny, but when they just miss, what are we supposed to do? Slap our knees and say, ""Lord a-mighty, they dern near ran into each other and wouldn't that have been funny!"""
1,"In many ways, Fritz Lang's The Big Heat, scripted by former crime reporter Sydney Boehm, laid the groundwork not only for ""Dirty Harry,"" but for the whole sub-genre of 'rogue cop' films that began to surface during the Vietnam era."
1,"Mr. Lang can direct a film. He has put his mind to it, in this instance, and he has brought forth a hot one with a sting."
1,"That's the beauty of Lang's moral ambidexterity. He tells the story of a heroic cop, while using it to mask another story, so much darker, beneath."
1,"Lang strips down William P McGivern's novel to essentials, giving the story a narrative drive as efficient and powerful as a handgun."
1,"Ford's portrayal of the homicide sergeant is honest and packs much wallop. Lang's direction builds taut suspense, throwing unexpected, and believable, thrills at the audience."
1,"Brutal, atmospheric, and exciting -- highly recommended."
1,"The film is drum-tight, directed with muscular clarity and force."
1,Fascinating if not necessarily improved edition of Howard Hawks' 1946 detective classic.
1,"It is typical of this most puzzling of films that no one agrees even on why it is so puzzling. Yet that has never affected The Big Sleep's enduring popularity, because the movie is about the process of a criminal investigation, not its results."
1,A movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.
1,"Don't try too hard to follow the story, just get swept away by the mood of the film."
0,It's likely to leave you confused and dissatisfied.
1,This is arguably the high-water mark of Hollywood's love affair with the infinitely slippery possibilities of the English language.
1,"Brittle Chandler characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way."
1,What you remember here are moments.
1,"No screen couple, before or since, had as much chemistry as Bogart and Bacall."
1,"The Big Sleep, though, is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones."
1,"The plot is a bundle of confusions, but who cares? Few films have made cigarettes seem so glamorous. Or had such seductive repartee."
1,"The Big Sleep is as fresh and perverse as ever, and remains one of Hollywood's most entrancingly strange bedtime stories."
1,"The Big Sleep is wakeful fare for folks who don't care what is going on, or why, so long as the talk is hard and the action harder."
1,"The Big Sleep is the best scripted, best directed, best acted, and least comprehensible film noir ever made."
1,"It is a fast-moving drama, knee-deep in corpses, as tough as they come. It is rather'difficult to keep track of who is murdering whom and why, but there is not time to worry about such details with so many bullets flying around."
0,The movie feels kind of embalmed.
1,Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed a horror film that should raise the hackles of the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.
1,"It's fierce and Freudian as well as great cinematic fun, with ample fodder for the amateur psychologist following up on Hitch's tortuous involvement with his leading ladies."
0,Beneath all of this elaborate feather bedlam lies a Hitch cock-and-bull story that's essentially a fowl ball.
1,"Alfred Hitchcock's most abstract film (1963), and perhaps his subtlest, still yielding new meanings and inflections after a dozen or more viewings."
0,The movie flaps to a plotless end.
1,Few films depict so eerily yet so meticulously the metaphysical and historical sense of a world out of joint.
1,"Hitch's much misappreciated follow-up to Psycho is arguably the greatest of all disaster films -- a triumph of special effects, as well as the fountainhead of what has become known as gross-out horror."
1,"Drawing from the relatively invisible literary talents of Daphne DuMaurier and Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a major work of cinematic art, and ""cinematic"" is the operative term here, not ""literary"" or ""sociological."""
1,"The true genius of the film, based on a 1952 short story by Daphne du Maurier, is the way Hitchcock makes the malevolent birds seem like manifestations of his characters' mental unease."
1,"Hitchcock prolongs his prelude to horror for more than half the film, playing with audience suspense with comedy and romance while he sets his stage. The horror when it comes is a hair-raiser ..."
0,A whodunit that begs the question of why it was made.
1,The film still manages a good slice of old-fashioned suspense.
0,Only Marian Waldman as the house-mother comes across with any life.
1,"Made at a time when there were as yet no fixed rules for the slasher subgenre, here anything goes, and the survival of neither virgin nor even final girl comes guaranteed."
0,Takes us all the way to the rim of space only to bog us down in a talky melodrama whipped up out of mad scientists and haunted houses.
1,"It cost half as much as Star Trek and looks better -- not as lavish, perhaps, but more original. The special effects are fancy, and the design even more so."
0,"Disney's most ambitious and costly production to date -- about a spaceship crew which encounters a Black Hole and a long-lost madman -- and if looks were everything, you could hardly fault it."
1,"It is good to see the Disney craftsmen doing what they do best on such a grand and risky scale. If one has time for only one space opera this season, this is the one to choose."
1,"The authentic, silent, swashbuckling classic, an early two-colour Technicolor production that the athletic Douglas Fairbanks starred in 85 years ago."
0,"Even given all of its inconsistencies, implausibilities and recycled cliches, ""Black Rain"" might have been entertaining if the filmmakers had found the right note for the material."
0,Why doesn't it work for me? I suspect it has to do with the constant awareness that the story is more important than anybody in it.
0,"Unfortunately, all the major characters have a whiff of Hollywood artifice, largely because (as has happened too often before in his career) Frankenheimer gets carried away by their verbosity."
1,John Frankenheimer's film of Black Sunday is an intelligent and meticulous depiction of an act of outlandish terrorism -- the planned slaughter of the Super Bowl stadium audience.
0,"Black Sunday may well make a bundle, thanks to the technical skill with which it manages its long-delayed payoff. But it is getting tiresome to be forced to admire, for want of anything else to do, the skill with which moviemakers jerk audiences around."
0,"Violence (more than 30 on-screen deaths) makes a poor substitute for suspense, while sloppy, rear projection work drains most of the excitement from the climax."
0,Black Sunday takes such a plodding literal-minded approach with an extravagant thriller premise that we have more than enough time to watch the gears working and all too often jamming.
1,"... it's good to see the director of ""Five Easy Pieces"" in the saddle again."
0,Black Widow is an interesting movie struggling to escape from a fatal overload of commercial considerations.
1,"Like most of his British films, Blackmail is a sign of things to come rather than Hitchcock at his height, but it shouldn't be missed."
1,"Blackmail marked Hitchcock's first use of sound, and it remains famous for its innovations in that area. But it's now more stimulating for its experiment with narrative structure."
0,"The director, Alfred Hitchcock, frequently fails to see that his scenes are adequately lighted and more often than not the images do not stand out as distinctly as they might if more attention had been paid to the shading of the interior walls."
0,Blackmail is most draggy. It has no speed or pace and very little suspense.
0,What this movie needs is Cybill Shepherd playing hard to get. Or anybody playing hard to get.
0,"This is the kind of movie that serves as a reminder that comedy is agonizingly difficult when it works, and even more trouble when it doesn't."
1,"Comic possibilities are everywhere in Blind Date, and the tireless Mr. Edwards leaves none of them unexploited."
1,"Most impressive is Sternberg's gift of concision and elaboration. Glide and dwell, glide and dwell. He knows when to compress, when to intensify."
1,"She smolders, she smirks, she fails to be amused, she dominates, she destroys."
1,"Intriguing for its glimpses of backstage life in shabby German postwar vaudeville, and for Dietrich's performance."
1,Dietrich brought to her role a haunting combination of freshness and world-weariness.
1,You can't hear 'Falling In Love Again' too many times.
1,"Not only is Mr. Jannings's and Miss Dietrich's acting excellent, but they are supported by an unusually competent cast."
1,"The film looks and sounds its age, but remains enthralling."
1,"On top of the drawing power of Jannings comes the discovery of a new magnet, Marlene Dietrich."
1,"The first film collaboration between Josef von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich, this reeks with decay and sexuality."
1,"If The Blue Angel is familiar material, it is also the sort of hing that Jannings does better than anyone else."
1,"Once the party's over, the money's lost and the humiliation has set in, what leader, what purifying force can rescue everyone from this devastating shame, while supplying something of the same erotic, exalting excitement?"
1,Emil Jannings portrays this role superbly... This surely is one of the finest examples of tragic acting yet furnished from the screen.
1,
1,"Ulmer (Murnau's one time art director and assistant) is the most subterranean of all directors, and here turns out a triumph of mind, eye and talent."
1,"Edgar G. Ulmer somehow managed to transform the absurd limitations of the scripts, budgets, and actors he was given to work with into a mad aesthetic principle."
0,The Border is surprisingly tepid stuff for a Jack Nicholson vehicle.
1,"More firm in its social implications than ever it was on the stage and blessed with a priceless performance by rocketing Judy Holliday, this beautifully integrated compound of character study and farce made a resounding entry at the Victoria yesterday."
1,"A very simple idea, but enlivened by a sharp, witty script, and by Cukor's effortless handling of the brilliant performances."
0,"George Cukor directed, a little impersonally for him."
1,Holliday delights as she tosses off the malaprops that so aptly fit the character.
1,The show comes off as one of the best comedies in recent seasons. This is largely due to a sparkling portrayal of Judy Holliday.
1,"The script is lively, dialogue is quite witty, acting generally is good and the comedy is sufficiently high to survive the rather sentimental message."
1,"The Boston Strangler requires a judgment not only on the quality of the film (very good), but also on its moral and ethical implications."
0,To be avoided as surely as a stranger who appears at your door and identifies himself as a plumber whom you have not called.
0,"On the basis of three films, it is now possible to say that the Pacific Ocean is not Dino De Laurentiis's cup of tea."
1,"A great adventure, a lush romance, and a good movie."
0,"It's all a brave try, though Gibson is perhaps not up to the demands of a Christian's progress from naive rating to self-loathing exile, and Donaldson's direction often verges on the stolid."
1,"An intelligent, firstrate, revisionist telling of the famous tale of Fletcher Christian's mutiny against Captain Bligh."
0,"The answer should have made a great thriller, but the film is sunk by a series of preposterous performances."
0,"With two excellent antagonists in Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier, The Boys from Brazil presents a gripping, suspenseful drama for nearly all of its two hours -- then lets go at the end and falls into a heap."
0,"The plot is less suspenseful than the overacting contest between the two leads, Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck, who spend most of their screen time one-upping each other in affectations."
1,"An impressive feat of carefully designed and modulated academic filmmaking, a class job in the tradition of Hitchcock or Wyler at their most polished."
0,This picture is another of [producer] Lew Grade's international blockbuster packages; the deals are worked out in terms of story elements that will sell and of performers with followings in as many markets as possible.
0,The characters take such a secondary importance to the gadget that we never feel much for them.
0,"I'd have liked Breakout more, I think, if it had been done as a flat-out thriller without the added touches."
0,Made-for-TV eyewash for disheartened Bears fans to drown their sorrows in.
1,"On its own, somewhat obvious level, Brian's Song worked. Not least in its favor were two exceptionally fine performances: James Caan as Brian Piccolo and Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers."
1,Less cynical souls will weep buckets.
1,An uncommonly good little picture -- and one which is frankly designed to appeal to that group of film-goers who are provoked by the 'usual movie tripe.'
0,"Some films don't age well, and no doubt Brief Encounter had more of an emotional effect in the social climate of post-war Britain."
1,A classic of passionate reserve.
1,Go and see it again - and try not to giggle at the clipped accents.
1,David Lean paints heartbreak with perfect decorum.
1,The loveliest period piece imaginable.
1,"Twee, but you can't help but get involved."
1,Cyril Raymond manages to invest the stodgy character with a lovable quality.
0,Rarely rises above the level of the old women's magazines.
1,Sheer perfection-the gold standard of tragic romances whose influence can still be seen to this day.
1,"One of the most vivid, impassioned and painfully believable love stories ever committed to celluloid."
1,One of cinema's classic love stories.
1,"Romance and goodness are evoked with equal power and from these conflicting impulses, voluptuous demons spring eternal."
1,"Lean's sad, buttoned-up account of unconsummated love is about all of us and our cautious natures."
0,"We cannot accept this picture as either an exciting or reasonable account of the attitudes and ways of American Indians. They merit justice, but not such patronage."
1,"A fine film all the same, despite the compromised ending, quite beautifully shot by Ernest Palmer."
1,"Essentially it's an appealing, sentimental Indian romance, with plenty of action."
1,"Films like this, naive as they seem today, helped nudge a xenophobic nation toward racial tolerance."
1,One of D.W. Griffith's most beautiful films.
1,There is so much that is unusually excellent and excellently unusual in Broken Blossoms that one is compelled by enthusiasm to write about it.
1,"Very much on the credit side, though, are stretches of pure Griffith poetry, marvellous use of light and shadow in cameraman Billy Bitzer's evocation of foggy Limehouse, and a truly unforgettable performance from Gish."
0,"Although the picture consumes only 90 minutes, it somehow seems draggy, for the reason that everything other than the scenes with the three principals seems extraneous and tends to clog the progression of the tale."
1,"The Brotherhood has an old-fashioned, beautiful energy about it."
0,[Director Martin] Ritt can do very little with the breast-beating which attends this tale of brotherly love and self-sacrifice.
0,"""Bug"" is decidedly poisonous.It is not simply a scary picture, nor simply a violent one. It is a cruel picture."
1,An imaginative little B thriller that manages to be genuinely suspenseful.
0,"Its last half is largely static, and the film never revives much interest."
0,"A witless, hapless exercise in the wrong way to package Goldberg."
1,"Although Butch Cassidy wasn't the first movie to pair up a couple of wisecracking best friends in an action/adventure setting, this film became the model of how well that approach could work when done right."
1,Very funny in a strictly contemporary way-the last exuberant word on movies about the men of the mythic American West who have outlived their day.
0,"William Goldman's script is constantly too cute and never gets up the nerve, by God, to admit it's a Western."
1,"One of the funniest, if slightest, Westerns of recent years."
0,"Every character, every scene, is marred by the film's double view, which oscillates between sympathy and farce."
1,"The John Foreman production is episodic, but George Roy Hill's direction is so satisfying in catching the full value of the Goldman screenplay that a high degree of interest is sustained."
0,You have to admire the craft and assurance of the thing even as its artificiality hits you in the face.
1,It is a great film and will be an exceptionally popular and profitable one.
1,"George Sidney's tacky 1963 musical fantasy-satire about the Elvis craze, based on the Broadway show of the same title, isn't exactly good, but if you like what he does with Ann-Margret, Janet Leigh, and pink decor, it's sort of magnificent."
0,"Unfortunately, Mr. Sidney and his scriptwriter, Irving Brecher, have allowed the essence of this spirited musical comedy of Michael Stewart to get away from them."
1,"This enjoyable timepiece is notable today for its peppy score, energetic dancing, and for having made a star of the extremely nubile Ann-Margret, 22 passing for 16. Her fresh, wholesome eroticism fairly bursts off the screen."
1,Credit George Sidney with directing one of the better fun and frolic tune packages.
1,"Why watch George Sidney's adaptation of the popular stage musical when you can slap yourself upside the head with a soggy, hot-pink slab of beef?"
0,"[Bye Bye Birdie] had an apple-cheekiness about it on the stage that seems slightly worm-eaten on film, and the result is more goof than spoof."
0,A shrill and preposterous musical Western.
0,"Doris Day works very, very hard at being Calamity and is hardly realistic at all."
1,"As a pistol-packin' cowgirl in fringed leather trousers, Day is terrific, an object of athletic awe and irrepressible good cheer."
1,"The tunes are gold, and as Jane approaches a local creek, resplendent in her gorgeous yellow gown, we get one of the most famous visual gags in the history of the musical."
1,"Exactly what we were promised: ornate, visually beautiful, romantic and staged as the most lavish production in the history of the Hollywood musical. If that's what you like, you'll like it."
1,"Miss Garbo has interpreted Marguerite Gautier with the subtlety that has earned for her the title, 'first lady of the screen.'"
1,"Miss Garbo, as Marguerite Gauthier, the weak-chested Lady of the Camelias, coughing delicately into a lace hanky, never looked or languished better."
1,"A cold-blooded, calculated build-up of sadistic menace and shivering dread is accomplished with frightening adroitness in J. Lee Thompson's melodrama Cape Fear."
1,The movie that launched both Flynn and the '30s cycle of swashbucklers.
1,"With a spirited and criminally good-looking Australian named Errol Flynn playing the genteel buccaneer to the hilt, the photoplay recaptures the air of high romantic adventure which is so essential to the tale."
1,It's a spectacle which will establish both Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.
1,"Michael Curtiz, the most polished of Warner's studio technicians, starts Flynn off royally."
1,Carnival of Souls works well enough as chill-up-the-spine cinema.
1,"It depends on crisp black-and-white photography, atmosphere and surprisingly effective acting."
1,The mesmerising power of the carnival and dance-hall sequences far outweighs the corniness of the awkward intimate scenes.
1,"Occasionally a feature film emerges from the midwest, although this is the first ever out of Lawrence, Kans, where a group of commercial film pros veered off into a try at producing theatrical entertainment."
0,There isn't very much here to sustain interest.
0,"The characters -- despite the broad mean streaks the script gives them -- emerge as soft and sentimental, and the plot is mired in a tired love triangle (Foster-Gary Busey-Robbie Robertson) that doesn't go anywhere."
0,"Carny is bursting with more information about American carnivals that it can contain, surrounding a plot too thin to support it."
0,There is little suspense or dramatic tension; everything plays out like bad melodrama or cheap exploitation.
1,"Unlike other examples of the horror genre, there are classic elements of tragedy that lend this gruesome tale a compelling edge."
1,Brian De Palma's Carrie is an absolutely spellbinding horror movie... It's also (and this is what makes it so good) an observant human portrait.
1,Young director Brian DePalma is fast making his reputation in the genre of the suspense-horror film.
0,"It is sometimes funny in a puzzling kind of way, it is generally overwrought in an irritating kind of way, and once in a while it is inappropriately touching."
1,The fierce sympathy it extends to its unfashionable central character puts the film a million miles above the contemporary line in sick exploitation.
0,"This 1976 thriller, about a high school outcast (Sissy Spacek) who uses her telekinetic powers to massacre the graduating class, contains a number of interesting ideas. But as with most of his films, De Palma can't keep track of them."
1,"Carrie is a modest but effective shock-suspense drama about a pubescent girl, her evangelical mother and cruel schoolmates."
1,An exercise in high style that even the most unredeemably rational among moviegoers should find enormously enjoyable.
1,"More superpowers from Brian De Palma, this time in high school, in a screen version of a Stephen King novel that's become a horror classic."
1,A voluptuously shot horror movie.
1,"With each new movie, [De Palma] comes closer to mastering Hitchcock's trademark of teasing suspense and tongue-in-cheek horror."
1,Carrie's climactic empowerment is all at once the tragedy and triumph of a young woman trapped between Biblical regression and a secular coming-out.
1,"Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it."
1,The greatest pleasure anyone can derive from this movie comes through simply watching it.
1,A brilliant film that merits inclusion in every self-respecting film critic's top three.
1,"Yes, indeed, the Warners here have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap."
1,"Across seven decades, the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman starrer has emerged as Americans' default favorite movie."
1,"Its complex propagandist subtexts and vision of a reluctantly martial America's 'stumbling' morality still intrigue, just as Bogart's cult reputation among younger viewers still obtains."
1,Part of what makes this wartime Hollywood drama (1942) about love and political commitment so fondly remembered is its evocation of a time when the sentiment of this country about certain things appeared to be unified.
1,"There's a reason the world loves this wartime film, now digitally restored: more memorable dialogue than should be strictly legal, heartbreaking performances from the two leads and a plot that works with Swiss-watch precision."
1,"Irresistible, big-hearted film-making."
1,"As time goes by, the appeal of Casablanca shows no sign of diminishing."
1,Film should be a solid moneymaker everywhere.
1,"About Casablanca there clings a quality of lovely, urgent innocence."
1,Even hardened cynics who might be impelled to dismiss it as a collection of button-pushing clich챕s will most likely get swept up in the all the unabashed romance.
1,"Its undying appeal may be the result of the Hollywood factory's skill, in those days, in fashioning something memorable out of virtually nothing."
1,"Casablanca is the most sociable, the most companionable film ever made. Life as an endless party."
1,Nobody lights a torch like Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa or carries one like Humphrey Bogart's Rick.
1,"There are some of the very finest character actors that Warner Brothers could muster and a rich, detailed screenplay studded with an indecent number of sparklingly quotable lines. It is a movie to play again, and again."
1,An entertaining adventure story played against the colorful background of the cosmopolitan city that has become an important stop on the timetable of the European refugee.
1,"Curtiz's film is a classic for a reason -- it's crafted with the precision, detail and beauty of a Faberg챕 egg; the dialogue is hauntingly memorable and, in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, it has one of the most magnetic screen pairings in history."
1,"Certainly a more accomplished cast of players cannot be imagined, and their direction by Michael Curtiz is inspired."
1,"While the future was uncertain, the resolute characters of this exquisite wartime drama found peace through love and resistance."
1,"A long and lively film, bulging with acting talent and breathless with its own dramatic momentum."
1,"Where most other war-time melodramas have pinned their faith upon breakneck action, [Casablanca] derives its superb strength from the clashes and interplay of character [and] Michael Curtiz's highly disciplined handling of the suspense."
0,...a definitive example of what can happen when everybody working on a film goes simultaneously berserk.
0,"It's the sort of reckless, disconnected nonsense that could be telescoped or stopped at any point."
0,Even less amusing than the more 'serious' Bond films.
0,The few good aspects of this farce are vastly outweighed by the bad.
1,"Peter Sellers has some amusing gags as the gambler, the chance of dressing up in various guises and a neat near-seduction scene with Ursula Andress."
0,Out of five directors -- only McGrath manages to connect with this brontosaurian James Bond parody.
0,Poor 007 is now lost in a hall of distorting mirrors.
0,"Things pick up a little bit when Orson Welles, Peter Sellers, and Woody Allen stumble into the scene, but the total experience remains boringly incoherent."
1,"Like most spoofs, it wears thin fairly quickly."
1,Hugely entertaining.
1,It is not only in actual cinematic effects that Mr. Leni's work is telling; there are sequences in the story which reveal his absolute command of the players.
1,"[This] adroitly atmospheric film is virtually an ideogram of narrative suspension and impact, and it's a lovely, musty, nightened place to visit."
1,"What makes Canary sing is Leni's pioneering mix of spooky expressionism and light comedy, fabulous camera work, and nice turns from Laura La Plante, Creighton Hale, and Martha Mattox."
1,Mr. Leni has screened this ordinary melodrama in so masterly a fashion as to place it among the productions which must been seen by any one interested in moving pictures.
1,"What distinguishes Universal's film version of the C-C play is Paul Leni's intelligent handling of a weird theme, introducing some of his novel settings and ideas with which he became identified."
1,"It is greatly to the credit of the producer of The Cat and the Canary, Mr. Paul Leni, that he has succeeded in making it undeniably ""spooky."""
1,What a pack of trashy people these accomplished actors perform!
1,"As so often with adaptations of Williams, it frequently errs on the side of overstatement and pretension, but still remains immensely enjoyable as a piece of cod-Freudian codswallop."
1,"An intense, important motion picture."
1,"Burl Ives and Judith Anderson are highly entertaining as the nightmare parents, Big Daddy and Big Mama, and Jack Carson has one of his last good roles as Newman's competitive older brother."
1,"A formaldehyded tabby that sits static while layer after layer of its skin is peeled off, life after life of its nine lives unsentimentally destroyed."
0,"Ladies who have such temptations -- in straight horror pictures, at least -- should exercise their digits a bit more freely than does Simone Simon in this film."
1,"First in the wondrous series of B movies in which Val Lewton elaborated his principle of horrors imagined rather than seen, with a superbly judged performance from Simon."
1,"Cat People wasn't frightening like a slasher movie, using shocks and gore, but frightening in an eerie, mysterious way that was hard to define; the screen harbored unseen threats."
1,"More a film about unreasoning fear than the supernatural, this work demonstrates what a filmmaker can accomplish when he substitutes taste and intelligence for special effects."
1,This is a weird drama of thrill-chill caliber.
1,"I do like a film that opens with a mission statement, and... Cat People starts thus: ""Even as fog continues to lie in the valleys, so does ancient sin cling to the low places, the depressions in the world consciousness."""
0,"The result has a certain cinematic beauty, and Kinski, in particular, plays her role with an appropriate cat-like presence. Yet alongside the 1942 version (produced by Val Lewton, directed by Jaques Tourneur) it is clear which one is the winner."
1,"Cat People is a good movie in an old tradition, a fantasy-horror film that takes itself just seriously enough to work, has just enough fun to be entertaining, [and] contains elements of intrinsic fascination in its magnificent black leopards."
1,"The seductively exotic surface of this mythically underpinned fantasy might be offset for some by much graphic gore, but if you can buy the romantic metaphors for the primitivisms of sexual obsession, the film delivers down the line."
0,"Paul Schrader's hammering, art-porno remake of Jacques Tourneur's deft little thriller."
1,"Kinski was essential to the film as conceived, and she's endlessly watchable."
0,"Schrader takes himself very seriously, but after ""Cat People,"" there's no reason the public should perceive him as anything greater than an exploitation director with delusions of grandeur."
0,"Cat People, director Paul Schrader's remake of a 1942 B-movie, combines explicit sex, graphic violence, special effects and the supernatural and somehow falls flat."
0,"The most offputting thing about such canny, tear-stained movies as The Champ is not their navet but their unholy sophistication. These movies don't mean to deal with the world as it really is, but as it should be."
0,A pointless update of King Vidor's '30s weepie.
1,"A three-alarm, three-hanky movie of the highest order, perfect for your kids who don't get to see many truly sad films."
0,The tear-jerking is so determined and persistent that your ducts feel as if they'd been worked over with a catheter.
0,
1,The contrasting black and white cinematography perfectly fits the dark mood. The fight sequences are excitingly and realistically staged.
1,"Kirk Douglas does a good, aggressive job, with a slight inclination to over-eagerness at times, which might amuse an old fight fan."
0,"The Set-Up, made the same year, is infinitely superior."
1,"Frank Planer's photography has much drama as the script as it begins to tell the story right under the titles and continues compelling on its course through the grim, relentless narrative."
1,"A tight, gripping drama worth more to the movie customer than many multi-million epics."
1,"Made when the studio system was on its last legs, Charade still feels fresh, quick-witted, nothing like the artificial, airless Hollywood pictures of its time."
0,"I tell you, this light-hearted picture is full of such gruesome violence."
1,"Donen's typically slick comedy thriller, ingeniously scripted by Peter Stone, is a mammoth audience teaser."
1,"Firsttime teaming of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, a natural, gives the sophisticated romantic caper an international appeal, + the selling points of adventure, suspense and suberb comedy."
0,What's going on is sort of confused.
1,A terrifically entertaining comedy-thriller.
1,"If you haven't seen Charade, you really need to."
1,"Few thrillers create as much sheer joy and happiness as Charade, in which Cary Grant spoofs his Alfred Hitchcock persona, Audrey Hepburn exudes her usual magnetic charm, and Paris is as scenic as ever."
1,"Directed with an arched eyebrow by Stanley Donen, the film was released just weeks after John F Kennedy's assassination, giving shellshocked Americans a welcome bite of Hollywood candyfloss."
0,It preserves some of the form and language of White's original but fattens and sweetens his lean and pungent prose with songs by Richard and Robert Sherman.
0,The problem with Checking Out is that it provides us with fears we can understand and responses that seem to have been phoned in from a sitcom.
1,"Certainly, this is a gently evocative movie, with its glimpses of a strict and self-contained culture, and its memories of a time gone by."
0,A worthy but irretrievably dull homily.
1,"A dedicated team of faithful adapters created a wonderfully rich movie version of the book in 1981, and the emotion and intellectual depths of the story resonate through the decades."
1,"Jeremy Paul Kagan's The Chosen is singularly brilliant, an impressive achievement that puts it in the select company of the best films of the year."
0,"The Chosen never came alive for me. I respected what the filmmakers were trying to do, and I admired the ambitious period production, but I never really cared about these people."
1,Frolicsome in an artificially hearty sort of way.
0,"Peter Godfrey, the director, has a good deal to learn about the art of telling a boudoir joke in the parlor and getting away with it."
0,Thoroughly moth-eaten.
1,There is a real knowledge of human nature beneath the comedy.
0,"There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in A Christmas Story, but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them."
1,"Delightfully entertaining, with a wryly amusing narration to keep the adults in the audience smirking."
1,"If you're a fan of Christmas movies or films that use nostalgia as a driver, A Christmas Story cannot be missed. Then again, if you're in either category, you have probably already seen it."
1,"Shepherd provides the voice-over of the grown hero narrating, and his prominence on the sound track forces Clark to focus on visual humor, resulting in some wild Our Gang-style slapstick."
1,[A] richly remembered tale of Christmas past.
1,It's a nostalgic comedy featuring a family of eccentrics who lovingly celebrate the holidays and life itself in Midwestern America in the 1940s.
0,"Critically lauded at the time of its release, Cimarron was beloved by most who saw it. Eight decades later, it is frequently cited on lists of the most undeserving Academy Award winners."
1,A graphic and engrossing screen conception.
1,"This is a spectacular western away from all others. It holds action, sentiment, sympathy, thrills and comedy -- and 100% clean."
1,"It is a long, full-bodied picture, paced so deftly that although it covers more than half a century of crowded, changing events, it never drags and is rarely jerky."
1,"""Cimarron"" is magnificent in scope, powerful in treatment, admirable in acting. But it is even more than all this. It is one of few talking picture productions which inspires rather than awes."
0,The conclusion of the story... is not in the least convincing.
1,"Power and passion are the twin and intertwined themes of Cleopatra, and they have never burned with greater intensity or amid such opulence as they do in this extraordinary film."
1,"It is a surpassing entertainment, one of the great epic films of our day."
0,"Harrison, doing his waspish don act as Caesar, alone rises above mediocrity."
1,"Cleopatra is not only a supercolossal eye-filler (the unprecedented budget shows in the physical opulence throughout), but it is also a remarkably literate cinematic recreation of an historic epoch."
0,[A] general muddle.
0,"Sad to say, however, the deep-revolving, witty Mankiewicz fails most where most he hoped to succeed. As drama and as cinema, Cleopatra is raddled with flaws. It lacks style both in image and in action."
0,"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, for good and ill."
1,A stately but sometimes mindboggling spectacle.
1,"Melodramatic, and camp as Christmas, but nothing like the disaster its reputation suggests."
1,"Taylor inhabits the role with a focussed but uninhibited imperiousness, as when she turns Cleopatra's entrance into Rome, aboard a giant rolling sphinx, into the ultimate red-carpet photo op."
1,"Buster on the playing field, failing gloriously at every sport but executing each one beautifully when he dashes to his girl's rescue, is a study in precision and grace."
0,"Keaton himself strives to be funny, but his actions are so frightfully absurd that it strikes one that the character he plays never ought to be out of an asylum."
1,Minor Keaton but major almost any other comedian.
1,"The movie is worth seeing for a lot of reasons, one of them being the weirdly elegant pratfall Keaton takes on the baseball diamond when he gets clipped by an opposing player sliding into third."
0,
1,It's an exhilarating sparring match between Duvall's workmanlike fine-tuning and Penn's raw energy.
1,"There's great pleasure in watching these two actors work. And Hopper, a great actor himself, knows what they need to thrive."
1,"Colors is a special movie -- not just a police thriller, but a movie that has researched gangs and given some thought to what it wants to say about them."
1,"Though its story has the makings of standard stuff, and is sometimes sketchily told, nothing about 'Colors is ordinary."
1,"Never as eccentric as The Last Movie or Out of the Blue, Colors nevertheless makes most other cop movies look formulary by comparison."
1,Colors is a solidly crafted depiction of some current big-city horrors and succeeds largely because of the Robert Duvall-Sean Penn teaming as frontline cops. They're terrific together as members of the gang crime division of the LAPD.
0,"Michael Crichton's slow-paced thriller must have begun with something to say about the morality of the medical profession, but whatever it was is lost in the shuffle of unnecessary narrative detail."
0,"The aftereffect of Coma is a catlike yawn, benign and bored."
1,See it and worry.
1,Coma is an extremely entertaining suspense drama in the Hitchcock tradition.
1,A medical thriller of obvious authenticity... Crichton exploits the suspense with enough skill to make you overlook the far-fetched nature of the premise.
0,The big battle scenes are especially disappointing.
0,"Lots of machine-gunfire, explosions and disposable khaki-clad extras, as you'd expect."
1,"Comic book stuff, helped out by the presence of Rae Dawn Chong as an airline stewardess whose sarcastic commentary adds some comic counterpoint to the deliberately overscaled action."
1,"Chong lights up the film like a firefly, Schwarzenegger delivers a certain light touch of his own, [and] the result is palatable action comics."
0,A bad joke that backfires on the director.
1,A large dose of the best kind of escapist good humour.
0,There's a whole lot of nothing going on here.
0,"The film seems oddly unfocused, and the first hour is given over to barren stretches of flat, everyday dialog."
1,A lush 1944 musical vehicle built for Rita Hayworth at the height of her popularity.
1,It has Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth to sing and dance. And virtually every nook and corner is draped with beautiful girls.
1,"The whole thing, especially the comic stuff from Silvers and Arden, is executed with considerable brio. And Rudolph Mat's Technicolor photography is faultless."
1,Dance sequences spotlighting the terping abilities of Hayworth and Kelly are expertly staged.
1,The routine story is mightily improved by Arnold's sure sense of atmospheric locations and by the often sympathetic portrait of the monster.
0,This adventure has no depth.
1,"Jack Arnold has a flair for this sort of thing, and if there really is anything frightening about a man dressed up in a rubber suit with zippers where the gills ought to be, Arnold comes close to finding it."
1,"Jack Arnold's direction has done a firstrate job developing chills and suspense, and James C. Havens rates a good credit for his direction of the underwater sequences."
1,It makes for solid horror-thrill entertainment.
1,"Crossroads borrows so freely and is a reminder of so many other movies that it's a little startling, at the end, to realize how effective the movie is and how original it manages to feel despite all the plunderings."

1,"Miss Verdon has the sort of fine, fresh talent that the screen badly needs these days."
1,"Not the equal of Stanley Donen's parallel project, The Pajama Game, but a fine and vigorous film of the Broadway musical nonetheless."
0,A musical lumbered with too much plot.
1,"The Damn Yankees team, which ran the score high for three seasons in Broadway's legit ballpark, was reassembled to go to bat in this sparkling film version."
1,"As a cinemusical, Yankees manages to steal home by a wide margin."

1,Tantalizingly wicked -- watching it makes the color rise to your cheeks.
1,Director Stephen Frears accelerates entertainingly through Christopher Hampton's wig-and-powder sado-comedy about sexual mind games in 18th-century France.
1,An absorbing and seductive movie.
1,"Witty, entertaining, if occasionally overripe."
1,"A sombre, manipulative affair in which the decor is never allowed to usurp our interest."
0,This incisive study of sex as an arena for manipulative power games takes too long to catch fire and suffers from a deficient central performance.
1,The creepy plot still holds a certain fascination.
1,Its evocation of biological destiny wrenches the modernistic romance into tragedy.
0,"Excruciatingly embarrassing at the time, it now looks grotesquely pretentious and pathetically out of touch with the realities of the life-styles that it purports to represent."
1,[Schlesinger] has made a film that will set tongues to wagging and moralists to wringing their hands.
1,Miss Christie's performance is remarkably vibrant and outgoing.
0,"Maybe Romero, whose original movie was a genuine inspiration, hasn't figured out anything new to do with his zombies."

0,"It is comforting, of course, to have it made plain that our planetary neighbors are much wiser and more peaceful than are we, but this makes for a tepid entertainment in what is anamolously labeled the science-fiction field."
1,"Today, wistful viewers might ask: Where are Klaatu and Gort when we need them most?"
1,"Edmund H North's intelligent script and Wise's smooth direction are serious without being solemn, while Bernard Herrmann's effectively alien-sounding score reinforces the atmosphere of strangeness and potential menace."
1,"Like most of Robert Wise's work, this slickly constructed 1951 science fiction film settles squarely in the middle of its genre, better than some and worse than others."
1,"Cast, although secondary to the story, works well."
1,"The Day the Earth Stood Still may at first look like goofy, outdated science fiction, but its timeless warnings about violence, nuclear confrontation and the difficulties of policing the planet have made it an enduring cultural classic."
1,"The movie plays like an extended ad for Prohibition, three decades after it ended."
0,"[A] sci-fi, low-tech comedy horror show."
0,"On the screen, it seems to be like a walking corpse itself: jerking around malevolently, with putrefying limbs, a fixed, grisly smile on its face and absolutely no spontaneity."
0,"Williams and Piscopo seem to be on autopilot when delivering their lines, not relating to one another, not picking up each other`s timing."
1,Not even the classical soundtrack can turn this ponderous portrait of one man's obsession into the cinematic classic it has so often been mistaken for.
0,"Instead of bringing the story to life, Visconti has, I'm afraid, embalmed it."
0,Visconti's mastery of visual style almost succeeds in creating the very ideas and feelings that his heavy-handed narrative entirely misses.
0,"Visconti takes the veneer and calls it furniture. With infinite tedium, he pores over every facet of Tadzio's Botticelli visage."
1,"Dillinger is the film, we may speculate, that John Milius was born to make: violent, tough, filled with guns and blood."

1,Lean's last great film.
0,Mr. Bolt has reduced the vast upheaval of the Russian Revolution to the banalities of a doomed romance.
1,
0,"Steiger and Courtenay excepted, all the performances are very uncomfortable."
0,"David Lean's 1965 adaptation of Pasternak's romance of the Russian Revolution is intelligent and handsomely mounted, though it doesn't use its length to build to a particularly complex emotional effect."
1,One of the most meticulously designed and executed films.
1,"Literate, oldfashioned, soul-filling and thoroughly romantic."
1,Yes it's old-fashioned and sappy. But it's impossible not to swoon.
1,"Lean and Bolt pay tribute to a Tolstoyan ambition in Pasternak's samizdat novel, and also to a real contemporary relevance: the story of a suppressed writer."
0,"Demands everything from the viewer while offering little in return, with Lean coming across like a despised schoolmaster not wanting to open himself up to his braying students."
1,Maurice Jarre's music is as beguiling as ever and Lean squeezes all the pathos that he can out of the romance between Sharif's Yuri Zhivago and Julie Christie's febrile and gorgeous Lara Antipova.
1,Epic seems too small a word for the sweeping ambition and romance of Doctor Zhivago.
0,"One of those rare film adaptations which, unless you have already read the book, makes you wonder why anyone ever bothered to make the film at all."
1,"Despite the grim and brooding background, Zhivago has a surging buoyant spirit that is unquenchable. Doctor Zhivago is more than a masterful motion picture; it is a life experience."
1,"''Dodge City,'' Michael Curtiz's rousing 1939 oater about the civilizing of the ''wide-open Babylon of the American West,'' has everything..."
0,"At some point Dolls remains only an idea, a concept. It doesn't become an engine to shock and involve us."
1,Fredric March is the stellar performer in this blood-curdling shadow venture.
1,A remarkable achievement that deserves to be much better known.
1,"Dr Jekyll combines gothic horror, aristocratic romance and madcap Freudian psychodrama into a dizzying, exhilarating brew."
1,"It's a lurid potboiler which is notable for some superb camera work (a long POV tracking shot at the beginning of the film for example), some innovative early special effects and some of the most deranged overacting you are ever likely to see."
1,Mamoulian's vision of Dr Jekyll's hidden life in the foggy Victorian underworld is fascinating.
1,"The 1931 version of the Robert Louis Stevenson novella, directed by the great Rouben Mamoulian, is still the best version there is, far more frightening than the glossy MGM version Victor Fleming made a decade or so later."
0,"Camera trick of changing a central figure from the handsome Fredric March into the bestial, ape-like monster Hyde, carries a terrific punch, but in each successive use of the device -- and it is repeated four times -- it weakens in hair-raising effort."
0,One seeks in vain for an adequate development in this film of the powerful psychology which must remain the essential motive of such a fantasy as Stevenson created. A mere succession of incidents does not furnish this study.
0,"The onlooker, instead of being filled with righteous horror and indignation, begins to find so much super invention and thoroughness irresistibly comic."
1,"Fredric March, ably assisted by Miriam Hopkins and Rose Hobart, is magnificent as Hyde, and he gives Jekyll a stilted Victorian elegance which, being a little false, makes Hyde's existence seem more credible."
1,A seasonal classic.
1,"I've always thought Boris Karloff's last great role was as the snarling, malevolent voice of the Grinch in this 1966 television cartoon."
1,"This lusty, garishly colored, good-hearted cartoon was a wonderful, awful idea."
1,"The special works because of its surprisingly sentimental climax, one that comes by its emotion honestly, as the Grinch realizes the Christmas spirit is indomitable, no matter what he does to stop it."
1,"The story might be familiar, but watching The Grinch tiptoe around to ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" always brings a surge of fuzzy nostalgia every Christmas season that never seems to get old."
1,"Dracula deserves its status as a classic, although one might be tempted to append the word 'lesser' to that label."
1,"Certainly it is Lugosi's performance, and the cinematography of Karl Freund, that make Tod Browning's film such an influential Hollywood picture."
1,"With Mr. Browning's imaginative direction and Mr. Lugosi's makeup and weird gestures, this picture succeeds to some extent in its grand guignol intentions."
1,"Not by any means the masterpiece of fond memory or reputation, although the first twenty minutes are astonishingly fluid and brilliantly shot by Karl Freund."
1,"The opening scenes, set in Dracula's castle, are magnificent -- grave, stately, and severe. But the film becomes unbearably static once the action moves to England."
1,A sublimated ghost story related with all surface seriousness and above all with a remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere.
1,"An exciting melodrama, not as good as it ought to be but a cut above the ordinary trapdoor-and-winding-sheet type of mystery film."
1,"A handsome, moody rendition, more romantic than menacing."
1,"Yes, it is lowbrow and sophomoric. What you'd call dumb-de-dumb-dumb fun."
1,It's fun a lot of the time. Several individual shots are hilarious.
1,The script is a gold mine of one-liners.
1,"Mr. Aykroyd and Mr. Hanks play well together, but the funniest performance in the film is that of Dabney Coleman, as the smut king (who lisps)."
0,"Entertaining enough, but a pity they didn't draft in more of the Eisenhower context."
0,More innocuous than inventive.
1,"Most of the time it's fresh, funny, and surprising."
1,"Dan Aykroyd steals the show with a hilarious impersonation and tribute to the stern-faced TV cop Joe Friday, played for more than a decade by Jack Webb."
0,"This is not a bad starting place for a movie, but the filmmakers are unable to devise anything original for the patients to do once they've been set free."
1,"DePalma is not yet an artist of Hitchcock's stature, but he does earn the right to a comparison."
0,"Ultimately, the film amounts to little more than a consummate study of suspense technique, all dressed up with nowhere to go."
0,"Originality has never been a high value in the genre-bound aesthetic of filmmaking, but De Palma cheapens what he steals."
1,"Despite some major structural weaknesses, the cannily manipulated combination of mystery, gore and kinky sex adds up to a slick commercial package."
1,"Dressed To Kill is a nail-biting, seat-squirming, stylish murder mystery with a brain."
1,"Even without benefit of hindsight, Duel looks like the work of an unusually talented young director."
1,Simply a rivetingly murderous game of cat and mouse that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
0,"This 1971 made-for-TV movie was one of Steven Spielberg's auditions for Jaws, and the same slickly impersonal shock effects prevail."
1,This simple premise -- a killer truck stalks a driver -- becomes the basis for an exceptionally fraught and well- made suspense film.
0,"Several of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie."
0,"This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time."
1,"Lynch's third feature may have been a commercial disaster, but it gets under your skin and is marked by unforgettable images and an extraordinary soundtrack."
1,Dune is not the masterpiece its adherents have hoped for - but neither is it the disaster its detractors have claimed.
1,"Dune is a huge, hollow, imaginative and cold sci-fi epic."
0,"Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it."
0,"The problem is that the imagery isn't rooted in any story impulse, and so its power dissipates quickly."
0,"As you would expect from visionary director David Lynch, it is a movie of often staggering visual power, the most ambitious science fiction film since ""2001""; it's also stupefyingly dull and disorderly."
0,"Unless you have the book committed to memory, you'll find it practically impossible to follow the story."
0,"In short, there is energy and intensity but little clarity and emotion in this film. It is like a great, green iceberg: mammoth and imposing but very cold."
1,"Not only one of Kazan's richest films and Dean's first significant role, it is also arguably the actor's best performance."
1,"It's a film of great performances, atmospheric photography, and a sure sense of period and place."
1,"John Steinbeck's painful biblical allegory -- Genesis replayed in Monterey, California, circa 1917 -- is more palatable on the screen, thanks to the down-to-earth performances of James Dean as Cal/Cain and Richard Davalos as Aron/Abel."
1,"It's far from a dull movie, but it's certainly a very strange one; it's an enshrinement of the mixed-up kid."
0,"If you are not a Dangerfield fan, of course, probably nothing on earth could induce you to go to this movie. The great Dangerfield movie, however, has still to be made. This one doesn't get quite enough respect."
1,
1,"It's not what you'd call a classic or a class comedy act, but it has the kick of an embryonic pop phenomenon."
1,It's not always necessary to understand Pasolini to be riveted by what he does.
1,"Pasolini's working of the Sophocles tragedy, though not wholly successful, has its very definite strengths."
1,"One of the most underrated, neglected, and powerful of Pier Paolo Pasolini's features."
1,Pasolini both humanizes the classical legend and reaches deep into the modern psyche to find its origins in ancient agonies.
1,This tale of a pure soul struggling to be heard over the prejudice of the many is quite heart-rending.
1,"What we eventually see underneath this shell is not 'the study in dignity' that Ashley Montagu wrote about, but something far more poignant, a study in genteelness that somehow suppressed all rage."
0,"I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks."
1,"A marvellous movie, shot in stunning black-and-white by Freddie Francis."
0,"The picture itself is a strange trade-off between Lynch's personal themes -- the night world of obscure, disturbing sexual obsessions -- and the requirements of a middlebrow message movie."
1,Director David Lynch has created an eerily compelling atmosphere in recounting a hideously deformed man's perilous life in Victorian England.
1,"This is a tale of redemption and transcendence, of the hunchback of London Hospital, of the noble phantom who wanted to go to the opera, of Beauty and the Beast."
1,Lynch's powerful depiction of Merrick (played by John Hurt) moves a viewer from revulsion and fear to empathy and tenderness. That's the very movement of the story itself.
1,"Many Lynchian tropes are here, from a sense of foreboding to a fascination with the grotesque, in terms of Merrick and outsiders' reactions to him."
1,"It is an absorbing and satisfying drama, and Hurt's Merrick is very powerful."
1,The Enforcer is the best of the Dirty Harry movies at striking a balance between the action and the humor.
0,"Money, the big name of Clint Eastwood, a lot of gore and howling sirens and the urge to rail at various liberal notions are not enough to make even a passable movie out of ""The Enforcer."""
1,"Despite inferior contributions from most departments, Eastwood carries the picture, and Tyne Daly does well as the female cop against very stacked odds."
0,"The spitball script [from a story by Gail Morgan Hickman and S.W. Schurr] lurches along, stopping periodically for the blood-lettings and assorted running and jumping and chasing stuff."
0,"When the final credits roll, you can be forgiven a vague sense of dissatisfaction, because the creativity that went into formulating the premise was never extended to the script writing stage."
1,"It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season."
1,The plot gradually winds down into predictable though highly enoyable histrionics.
0,It's a rare film that has so many ideas and yet fails so consistently to make use of them.
1,A solidly satisfying actioner.
1,The movie proudly wears its affection for crusty Sergio Leone archetypes and countdown-clock suspense sequences; Carpenter was Tarantino long before Tarantino was.
1,"It has got an intriguing premise, an effective cast, and it has been expertly mounted."
1,The film plays its social satire broad but strings it along a rail of self-awareness.
1,"1997 is the year in which the film's events are set, but far from being a bright, progressive future, it is a hyperbolic deterioration of 1981's here and now"
1,"Intelligence applied exactly where it is most rare: in the lavish, star-studded epic."
1,"In the end, one should take from this picture a shaken feeling of having been through a lot of harsh and ennobling experiences."
0,"Watchable mainly for the sheer skill and drive of Preminger's direction, although at 220 minutes even that long outstays its welcome."
1,A thoroughly delightful but far from plausible mystery melodrama that operates exclusively on high spirits and a no-nonsense intelligence that is never sidetracked by coherence.
1,"Every scene develops characters. And they're developed in such offbeat fidelity to the way people do behave that we get all the more involved in the mystery, just because, for once, we halfway believe it could really be happening."
1,An enjoyable entertainment whose box-office failure was thoroughly undeserved.
0,The story gets more and more strained before it's resolved.
0,"Except for the ingratiating performances of Hurt and Weaver, this thriller-cum-mystery-cum-romance-cum-comedy is a victim of cinematic schizophrenia."
0,Holy smoke! What a pretentious and pedantic production he has made.
1,"An underrated film, perhaps because it is less science fiction than a tale of 'once upon a time.'"
0,"This 1966 film often looks good (it was Truffaut's first in color, photographed by Nicolas Roeg), but the ideas, such as they are, get lost in the meandering narrative."
1,"With a serious and even terrifying theme, this excursion into science fiction has been thoughtfully directed by Francois Truffaut and there is adequate evidence of light touches to bring welcome and needed relief to a sombre and scarifying subject."
0,"Even at the science-fiction horror-story level, the movie fails -- partly, I think, because Truffaut is too much of an artist to exploit the vulgar possibilities in the material."
0,"What started out as a taut thriller has somehow evolved into unintentional burlesque, with killer and victim functioning as a second-rate comedy team."
1,"Alan Bates, in a change of pace, is the loyal shepherd. Terence Stamp is a suitably vile Sgt. Troy, and Peter Finch makes Boldwood strong and honorable in his love for Bathsheba."
0,Pictorially excessive but dramatically barren.
0,Another classic bites the dust.
0,Christie has few real opportunities to branch out of her rather muted and pouty lead.
0,"Thomas Hardy was not the most dynamic novelist in English literature, but this sluggish 1967 film still does him a serious disservice."
1,[Schlesinger] displays the best sense of Victorian time and place since David Lean in Great Expectations.
1,One of the most entrancing and elemental landscape films ever shot in these isles.
1,"It's maybe not up there in the pantheon of British classics, but there's something highly relaxing and radical about the fact that Schlesinger articulates this classical story with breathy longeurs ..."
1,Christie carries the film with her own insouciant vulnerability. A classic.
1,It has a kick that most other Hardy adaptations have conspicuously lacked.
1,"Quality oozes from every pore, with John Schlesinger's direction complemented by Frederic Raphael's sharp script and a cast that includes Julie Christie, Alan Bates, Peter Finch and a dastardly Terence Stamp."
1,Mostly this is a triumph ...
1,"Everything in this extraordinary evocation of island life is seasonal; these folk, their affections and fortunes, shift with the winds and tides."
1,"With the emphasis on plot rather than character only Julie Christie finds a part she can turn round in, suggesting convincingly Bathsheba's curious combination of coquetry with integrity."
1,"Farewell, My Lovely is a great entertainment and a celebration of Robert Mitchum's absolute originality."
1,"It's as if someone had put pillow springs, power-steering and a tape deck into a classic racing-car. It is still handsome and it still goes, but it is a handsome mediocrity."
1,"The film's triumph is Mitchum's definitive Marlowe, which captures perfectly the character's down-at-heel integrity and erratic emotional involvement with his cases."
0,"Despite an impressive production and some firstrate performances, this third version fails to generate much suspense or excitement."
0,"Watching this movie has approximately the same effect as being locked overnight in a secondhand clothing store in Pasadena. There is an awful lot of dust and, after a while, the dummies look as if they are moving."
0,"Because the good things in the movie -- including the performances -- are so very good, it's a shame that the film's potential for greatness was so blatantly compromised."
1,Fatal Attraction has an inescapable pull to it; it's suffocatingly exciting.
1,Close should take pride in her performance. She should also expect a depressing avalanche of scripts requiring a she-wacko.
1,"Years hence, it will be possible to pinpoint the exact moment that produced Fatal Attraction, Adrian Lyne's new romantic thriller, and the precise circumstances that made it a hit."
0,"A predictable dog's dinner of Pavlovian thriller clich챕s, this will appeal strongly to those who think women should be kept on a short lead."
1,[The film brings] horror home to a place where the grownup moviegoer actually lives.
1,The screws are tightened expertly in this suspenseful meller about a flipped-out femme who makes life hell for the married man who scorns her.
0,"While billed as a romance and a thriller, the film strictly qualifies as neither, appealing to our prurience, guilt, hatred, and dread."
0,"Under the direction of Adrian Lyne, most of the picture's situations seem like randomly chosen place holders, flat events that just fill time until the final bizarre confrontation."
1,A honey of a picture of American family life.
1,Thoroughly enchanting comedy about the trials and tribulations a middle-aged family man faces when the daughter he dotes on decides to get married.
0,On the critical side: Minnelli could have timed many of the scenes so that laughs would not have stepped on dialog tag lines.
1,"Under Vincente Minelli's crisp direction, the fun rarely lets up."
1,This ostensibly lighthearted film about Spencer Tracy's Kafkaesque attempts to bring off his daughter's wedding is one of the bleakest films of a bleak decade.
1,"Spencer Tracy underplays the comedy to good effect, and Joan Bennett and Elizabeth Taylor are beautiful and efficient."
1,"Is it fun? Yeah, sort of, it is."
1,"The narrative is a little plodding, but adult punters will soon slip back into areverie for the lost visions of Saturday morning cinema."
1,A respectable time-waster.
0,"The expensive new version of Flash Gordon is a lot more gaudy, and just as dumb, as the original series starring Buster Crabbe."
1,"Perhaps, like many a superhero film, this one flags just a little in the final battle sequences, but Von Sydow is always there to keep things bizarre, playing it absolutely straight."
1,"a mid-air skirmish of corny old-fashioned retrofuturism and knowing postmodernism, even as its veneer of homespun innocence keeps being subverted by the corrupting powers of kink."
1,"Basically, whether laughing with this film, or at it, you'll have a blast."
1,"I'm reluctant to say what does happen, because the movie takes such an interesting U-turn into what develops into a halfway serious contrast between the values of the summer of love and the greed of the Me Decade."
1,It's hamstrung by leaden dialogue and the motley international cast - Python and the Grail are never that far away - but it's admirably unsentimental and by no means stupid.
1,"A vivid and muscular, if less than fully startling, account of lust, savagery, revenge, betrayal and assorted other dark doings in the Middle Ages."
0,
1,"One of the better, more restrained entries of the 'shock' school."
1,A sad story of considerable pathos despite the ridiculous plot.
1,Clavell's script successfully treads a fine line between black comedy and po-faced seriousness.
1,"Slightly above average 50s science fiction (1958), enlivened by a nearly literate script by James Clavell."
1,One strong factor of the picture is its unusual believability.
1,"Firmly rooted in the type of film he does best, Cronenberg unleashes a series of nauseating effects as Goldblum transforms into a fly over a period of weeks."
0,"...a film that tries to be too many things at once -- funny but not campy, sad and scary, a horror story and a human tragedy..."
1,"The playful, quirky chemistry between Goldblum and Davis in the first half of the movie ensures that this gothic horror is heartbreaking as well as stomach-churning."
0,"Image so much subverts intention that Jeff Goldblum's tragic flyperson finally seems more ludicrous than affecting, voyeuristically bizarre."
1,The Fly is almost unique for a horror movie in that it compels us sympathize with and root for the characters.
1,"David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 horror classic The Fly is not for the squeamish. Casting Jeff Goldblum was a good choice as he brings a quirky, common touch to the spacey scientist role."
1,A gross-your-eyes-out horror movie that is also the year's most poignant romance.
1,What makes The Fly such a stunning piece of obsessive film making is the way Cronenberg deftly allows us to identify with his monstrous creation.
1,"Wildly imaginative, gut-wrenchingly scarifying and profoundly primal (not to mention funny), David Cronenberg's The Fly is a movie that whacks you in the solar plexus and leaves you gasping."
1,"What's good about the film are the strong performances and the ingenious, mostly amusing script. What's ugly, of course, is the grossness. And what's bad is the movie's inability to reconcile its good and ugly aspects."
1,"As slimy and as grotesque as some of its special effects become, The Fly is a far superior horror film to the top-grossing film in America of late, Aliens."
1,"The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them."
1,"Like the rest of today's video-happy teen-age entertainments, Footloose doesn't expect to be watched closely or taken seriously. It wants to fill the screen with catchy music and pretty kids, and this it certainly accomplishes."
0,"Footloose is a seriously confused movie that tries to do three things, and does all of them badly."
0,A cynical and manipulative exercise with little feel for the teen culture it purports to celebrate.
1,Herbert Ross directed this odd but reasonably effective blend of rock music and didactic melodrama.
1,"Essential to the result is young Kevin Bacon, superb in the lead part."
0,"""Footloose"" turns out to be a sort of Boy Scout version of ""Flashdance,"" a carefully toned-down, overly respectable piece of schmaltz ..."
1,"Even with its excesses, Frantic is a reminder of how absorbing a good thriller can be."
1,Vintage Polanski.
1,"[Polanski] has succeeded in picking up the clever, unnerving thread of his earlier career."
1,Funny and unsettling.
0,"A thriller without much surprise, suspense or excitement."
0,[Polanski's] usual surrealism is almost completely absent.
0,"The situation -- a mother and daughter switch personalities for a day -- is rife with possibilities, but since this 1977 comedy is a Disney film, said possibilities are scrupulously squandered."
0,"Toward the end there are some amusing car-chase scenes. Elsewhere the humor is clotted by the feeling that the jokes are chasing the reactions, instead of the other way around."
0,Good performances struggle gamely to overcome the increasingly predictable plot.
0,"Now Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster think to themselves in each other's voices and talk in their own, which is better than being either Dean Jones or a dog, but not much."
1,"Fright Night is not a distinguished movie, but it has a lot of fun being undistinguished."
0,Its tone is never exactly comedic and its horrific touches are more disgusting than scary.
1,"It shouldn't even begin to work, and yet, strangely, it does, sort of, thanks to the assured handling of writer/director Holland."
1,"Chris Sarandon is terrific as the vampire, quite affable and debonair until his fingernails start to grow and his eyes get that glow."
1,"Fright Night dances on a tightwire between satire and terror, glittered by special effects and a with-it nonchalance."
1,"Out of From Here to Eternity, a novel whose anger and compassion stirred a postwar reading public as few such works have, Columbia and a company of sensitive hands have forged a film almost as towering and persuasive as its source."
1,"Contemporary audiences may not see why, even in its toned-down simplification of the novel, From Here to Eternity was the most daring movie of 1953, but it remains an acting bonanza."
1,"Rapturously received from the moment it was released in 1953, From Here to Eternity remains, half a century later, a singular cinematic experience, one of the landmarks of American film."
1,So clear-eyed and three-dimensional that it makes the recent Pearl Harbor look like a bunch of kids playing dress up.
0,Zinnemann's flat direction does produce its dull moments.
0,Sominex is cheaper and probably safer.
1,"It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business."
1,"Scriptwriter Daniel Taradash rescued, if not quite a gem, then at least a high-grade industrial diamond from this rough original."
1,"A high-calibre Hollywood prestige drama, sharp and sobering, with top-drawer work from Lancaster, Clift and Sinatra."
1,"I have to say that Clift's plot is far less compelling than Lancaster's and something of the zip goes when Frank Sinatra disappears from the action, sent to the stockade. But what a punch this movie still packs."
1,"The cast includes Frank Sinatra, Montgomery Clift and Ernest Borgnine, all of whom are fine, in what is essentially a melodrama."
1,"In From Here to Eternity, you can glimpse an uneasier future for America, with the social wreckage and the pretending."
1,"The film is anonymously directed, functionally paced and hysterical at times, though it seduces as a hot-blooded spectacle that stitches emotional detail onto the epic canvas of history."
1,There isn't a dull moment in the picture.
1,The film tells a compelling story with many of the elements that audiences find appealing.
1,"It is not a pretty picture, with its drunkenness, brawls, illicit affairs, bullyings and subservience to rank, but it is a true picture, and that is what matters most."
0,"There's not much to it beyond Jimmy Durante's raspy narration and Jackie Vernon's dim, galoot-y voice as the icy golem of the title."
0,"To those of middle age who remember Frosty fondly, we offer this warning: Look again, and yawn."
1,"The animation is folksy and cute, like an old-timey holiday card, and the raspy voice of Jimmy Durante...as the narrator is like home sweet home."
1,"The 1969 original, which, though hardly an animation classic, had a genuine, simple sweetness stemming from its inspiration."
1,"From the raspy sound of Jimmy Durante's narration to the pastel animation of the town, watching this movie...is like the warmth of listening to an old record."
0,"This stuff is funny enough, but somehow it's too easy. It's situation comedy, when the movie's earlier moments seemed to be promising us a hard-boiled commentary..."
1,"Funny Farm is one of those small miracles that starts out like a lot of other movies and then somehow finds its own way, step after step, to an original comic vision."
1,The year`s funniest movie to date.
1,"Brian De Palma's The Fury is a stylish entertainment, fast-paced, and acted with great energy."
1,"Weir's work has a delicacy, gentleness, even wispiness that would seem not well suited to the subject. And yet his film has an uncommon beauty, warmth, and immediacy, and a touch of the mysterious, too."
0,The central section devoted to training in Egypt sags badly through its crass buddy antics and its crude caricatures of wogs and pommies.
0,"Well acted and, within its limited terms, well made, Gallipoli represents a failure of nerve as well as design."
1,"Against a backdrop broader than his previous outings, Weir has fashioned what is virtually an intimate epic."
1,One of the most elegiac anti-war films ever made.
0,Classy and lifeless.
1,Few films impact the national psyche with as much force as Peter Weir's 1981 hit.
1,Richly deserves its place at the top.
1,"An anti-war movie at heart, but it's also flush with patriotic pride."
1,Gallipoli is a predictable war movie filled with all the gung-ho cliches of the genre -- and I loved it.
1,"Reisz, Caan, and screenwriter James Toback have constructed the character and the movie so convincingly that the scene not only works, but works two ways: first as suspense, and then as character revelation."
1,"...the standard of the choreography is excellent, and the final 20 minutes - which are almost all of Bruce fighting - are well worth holding out for."
1,"[Keaton's films] have such a graceful perfection, such a meshing of story, character and episode, that they unfold like music."
1,Newcomers will doubtless be surprised at the excellent pacing of the action.
0,A picture which is neither straight comedy nor is it thrilling drama.
0,This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton's previous efforts.
1,Only superlatives will do to describe Keaton's hilarious Civil War dramatic comedy.
0,The result is a flop.
1,An almost perfect entertainment.
1,"Spectacular chases, fires and explosions are captured with fluid camerawork. There are no stunt doubles for Keaton and of course no digital effects."
1,"The film boasts the most sustained passages of virtuoso slapstick genius Keaton ever shot, and an unflagging momentum that lets it get away with being a reel longer than most of his best-known pictures."
1,A hilarious comedy and a thrilling action film. The General has it all.
1,"In these times when all risk is assumed by CGI effects, Keaton's squealing funny, exquisitely timed, death-defying leaps are all the more breathtaking."
0,"The Getaway is a big, glossy, impersonal mechanical toy. It's like one of those devices for executive desks, with the stainless steel balls on the strings: It functions with great efficiency but doesn't accomplish anything."
0,The action and the violence of The Getaway are supported by no particular themes whatsoever. The movie just unravels.
1,[Gloria] is fun and engaging but slight. What saves this movie is Cassavetes' reliance on a tried-and-true plot construction.
1,"More than any other recent film I can think of, Gloria is a movie that depends on the mood you're in when you see it."
1,It's clear from the opening montage that we're in the hands of a master.
1,Gena Rowlands is excellent as the tired woman who decides to take her chances for the boy. The kid is a right blend of understanding and childish tantrums.
1,"John Cassavetes clearly set out to make a commercial film, but, intransigent personality that he was, he turned in a slice of pure avant-garde."
1,"The plot is a paranoid endgame in which the ubiquitous Mafia, in the know about everything before it happens, is the instrument of terminal destiny and running from death is as absurd as waiting for it."
1,It's hard not to get carried along.
1,A strong and valuable film.
1,Generally engrossing and always well-acted.
0,Matthew Broderick [is] catastrophically miscast as Shaw.
1,"Glory is, without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War."
1,"This is a good, moving, complicated film."
1,The stark clarity of Freddie Francis' cinematography combined with Zwick's intimate style evokes immediacy and fear.
1,"A pretty watchable and always interesting period film, well photographed by English cinematographer Freddie Francis."
1,A stirring and long overdue tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union cause in the Civil War.
1,"It is the movie's often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth."
0,It's a pity that it had to descend into such routine carnage.
1,"It's strange: We leave the movie having enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations. But they were there, and they were real."
0,"The movie is 'faithful' to the novel with a vengeance -- to what happens in the novel, that is, and not to the feel, mood, and spirit of it."
0,The movie can't see this through all its giant closeups of pretty knees and dancing feet. It's frivolous without being much fun.
0,"A literary adaptation that continually begs detrimental comparison with the novel, this relies too much on appearance, making little attempt to explore behind the beguiling '20s fa챌ade."
0,The Francis Coppola script and Jack Clayton's direction paint a savagely genteel portrait of an upper class generation that deserved in spades what it got circa 1929 and after.
0,Director Jack Clayton seems overawed by the opulence of the production as well as by the mythic presence of Fitzgerald -- and the result is a film of shimmering surface brilliance and almost complete lack of focus or substance.
0,The film is faithful to the letter of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel but entirely misses its spirit.
0,"In sum this picture is a total failure of every requisite sensibility. A long, slow, sickening bore."
1,"It's highly inventive, self-conscious camp, made in 1965, well before the genre wore itself out in superciliousness."
1,Lemmon plays it dirty throughout and for huge effect. Curtis underplays for equally comic effect. Wood comes through on a par with the two male stars.
0,"Simplicities of the right, simplicities of the left, but this one is beyond the possible. It is vile and insane. On top of that, it is dull."
0,The Green Berets simply will not do as a film about the war in Vietnam. It is offensive not only to those who oppose American policy but even to those who support it.
0,"""Grizzly"" is not only clumsily plotted, photographed and edited, it is also downright rude when it insists on showing us the bear lopping off an arm or decapitating a horse."
1,"It's expertly assembled classic western fodder, and the template for every elegiac ""retired killer"" movie to come - from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to Hugh Jackman in Logan."
0,"A disappointment, a movie in which the Japanese are mostly used for the mechanical requirements of the plot, and the Americans are constructed from durable but boring stereotypes."
0,"It's more cheerful than funny, and so insistently ungrudging about Americans and Japanese alike that its satire cuts like a wet sponge."
0,"The hero, though funny, is ultimately unsympathetic, securing through his cosy pacts nobody's position but his own, while the upbeat ending justifies strike-breaking. With comrades like this, who needs class enemies?"
1,"Drawn from real life, the conflict between cultures is good for both a laugh and a sober thought along the way."
0,"Its tone swings violently from pratfall to preachment, from an indictment of featherbed laziness to an extended beer-commercial celebration of the mythical American worker."
0,"By the end, it's curiously unformed, almost a blueprint for another movie."
1,"The movie is a bubble-headed series of teenage crises and crushes, alternating with historically accurate choreography of such forgotten dances as the Madison and the Roach."
1,"Waters writes warmth into his caricatures, lifting Hairspray above cartoon cult."
1,"The actors are best when they avoid exaggeration and remain weirdly sincere. That way, they do nothing to break the vibrant, even hallucinogenic spell of Mr. Waters's nostalgia."
1,Waters' most hygienically commercial film is a Retro schlock-fancier's delight.
1,"John Waters' appreciation for the tacky side of life is in full flower in Hairspray, a slight but often highly amusing diversion about integration, big girls' fashions and music-mad teens in 1962 Baltimore."
1,"Not only Waters's best movie, but a crossover gesture that expands his appeal without compromising his vision one iota; Ricki Lake as the hefty young heroine is especially delightful."
1,"When Divine's Edna Turnblad is on-screen in the sleeveless dresses she's partial to, the movie has something like the lunacy of a W. C. Fields in drag."
1,Perhaps Waters' best known movie.
1,"It is absurd and jolly, parodying not only the worst conventions of the teen film but also the Sixties social-conscience movie, with an anti-racist sub-plot."
1,Halloween remains untouched -- a modern classic of the most horrific kind.
0,"Since there is precious little character or plot development to pass the time between stalking sequences, one tends to wish the killer would get on with it."
1,"Halloween is an absolutely merciless thriller, a movie so violent and scary that, yes, I would compare it to Psycho."
1,"Perhaps not quite so resonant as Psycho to which it pays due homage, but it breathes the same air."
0,"After a promising opening, Halloween becomes just another maniac-on-the-loose suspenser."
1,"John Carpenter's 1978 tour de force, perhaps the most widely imitated film of the 70s."
1,Well worth another look on the big screen.
1,Carpenter obviously knows the genre well and he builds a properly terrifying atmosphere through his well-paced direction. It's an effective entry for its intended market.
1,"In horror, the jack-in-the-box scare... is the quickest way to get a scream, but the still shocks... are the ones that linger with you. ""Halloween"" has them both, but it specializes in the second."
1,"Carpenter's 1978 slasher classic has inspired a million imitations as well as sequels, but few that demonstrate so clearly that a disreputable genre movie can also be a pure, rigorous work of art."
1,The matter is settled; the filmed Hamlet of Laurence Olivier gives absolute proof that these classics are magnificiently suited to the screen.
0,"Laurence Olivier's famous 1948 interpretation of Shakespeare's play suffers slightly from his pop-Freud approach to the character and from some excessively flashy, wrongheaded camera work."
0,"Despite winning several Oscars, Olivier's (condensed) version of Shakespeare's masterpiece makes for frustrating viewing."
1,"This is picture-making at its best, and its showing must be done with the dignity it deserves."
1,Sir Laurence Olivier's masterful version of the classic.
1,"Altogether Hamlet is one of the most impressive films ever made and, so far as Shakespeare's work is concerned, it need never be done again on stage nor for the screen, as the Olivier production... may stand for all time as THE Hamlet."
1,"Its alliance of literature, theatre, and art is peerless proof that the screen can be brought to treat a wild dark poem of the mind, of unseen and unseeable things, in terms that do not corrupt great thought nor stultify cinema."
1,"Add to Sir Laurence as Hamlet a cast that is equal to each role, and we have the perfect production."
1,"Mr. Stone's screenplay is tightly written, precise and consistent in its methods, and seemingly perfectly realized in the performances of the very good cast headed by Mr. Caine."
1,"A powerful, brutal film containing a definitive Charles Bronson performance."
0,The production has a very handsome mid-1930s New Orleans period flavour but the cast can't lick the script.
1,"Hardcore, flawed and uneven, contains moments of pure revelation."
1,This hard-punching boxing-business picture... comes out swinging from the very beginning and doesn't stop until just before the end.
1,You might not have a lot of answers by the end but you'll find various scenes stay with you long after the movie is over.
0,Makes more goose pimples than sense.
1,"What makes the film so effective is not so much the slightly sinister characterisation of the generally neurotic group, but the fact that [director] Wise makes the house itself the central character, a beautifully designed and highly atmospheric entity."
0,The artful cinematic strokes of director Robert Wise and staff are not quite enough to override the major shortcomings of Nelson Gidding's screenplay.
1,"Pretty effective when it came out; it may be a little stiff in the joints by now, but it's still a much better scare show than the recent stinker remake."
0,"People stare about in terror and squeak: 'The house, it's alive!' The picture, it's dead."
1,"When The Haunting digs into the internals of its story, summons its spirits and lets them play havoc with cold reason, it has a power and fervor unmatched by any film ghost stories."
0,"Although the film tells the sadly ironic story of the extinction of one culture upon invasion by another, one comes out of the theater not so much moved as numbed."
1,"The conflict between nave dogma and nave innocence is effectively established, but the spectacle is always broader than it is deep."
1,"Hill's direction, solid in the intimate dramatic scenes, is as good in crowd shots which rep the major external events."
1,"Hawaii, as it happens, is a normal, lively, fairly intelligent ten-ton mouse."
0,"The movie is filled with promising starts, but then everything dissolves into a violent action climax."
0,"The setting is Las Vegas, where Mex wins and loses a lot of money in blackjack without getting too excited about it, and things work up tepidly to the big battle in a factory handily stocked with murderous devices."
0,
1,This is the kind of upbeat screwball comedy Hollywood used to do smoothly and well.
0,There's nothing worse than a pushy narrative.
0,The film drags its feet uncertainly from beginning to end.
1,"It's certainly likable enough and was a big hit when it came out, but one could hardly call it an auspicious artistic debut -- a crafty commercial entertainment with a certain amount of intelligence is more like it."
1,Heaven Can Wait is an outstanding film.
1,"[The film] has everything going for it: big laughs, populist politics, billowy sequences set in heaven, a murder plot, a climactic Super Bowl game, a supporting cast of choice comic actors, and best of all, a touching (but PG) romance."
1,"This is a very sweet movie to watch, the pleasant cinematic equivalent of light summer reading."
0,Beatty can carry off this sort of whimsy by playing it straight and keeping the ludicrous premise credible. But the film is dogged by the nagging vision of what might have been.
1,"It's far from being a personal work, but as always with Dwan, it's the best movie imaginable from the limited material at hand."
1,"Like all Shirley Temple stories, Heidi traces the reaction of human wickedness to the Temple dimples; unlike many of them, it has a craftsmanlike dramatic structure."
1,"The Hidden Fortress effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy."
1,"By introducing comedy into the mixture and telling the tale from an atypical perspective, Kurosawa has differentiated The Hidden Fortress from nearly every similar feudal era Japanese epic ever committed to the screen. This is a masterpiece."
1,"Essentially a superficial film and that Kurosawa, for all his talent, is as prone to pot-boiling as anyone else."
1,Kurosawa's calculations pay off in thrills and clever character delineation. The trials of the journey impose heroic imperatives and bonds of loyalty that ennoble even the meanest characters.
1,A heady mix of ironic allegory and seat-edge tension.
1,A satisfying piece of pulp.
0,"The Hindenburg is a disaster picture, all right. How else can you describe a movie that cost $12 million and makes people laugh out loud at all the wrong times?"
0,These guys don't have to use guns. All they have to do is open their mouths and bore each other to death.
1,"All in all, a very palpable hit."
1,Frears and writer Peter Prince have taken a potentially familiar tale of a gangland betrayal and revenge and made something richly inventive and most entertaining.
1,"It is a dexterously balanced killer thriller by the idiosyncratic Frears, whose every scene becomes a matter of life and death. A lighter clicks, a gun clicks; life or death, it all sounds the same."
1,"""The Hit"" is something special: thoughtful, perfectly performed and carrying the clear stamp of an extremely interesting director."
1,A gory and funny riff on the trusty standby of city kids being menaced by rural types.
0,It's a film that's about as funny and/or scary as a lump of sod.
1,"Playing like a Down Under Elmore Leonard novel, 100 Bloody Acres features lucky breaks and quick reverses; a persistent soundtrack of Aussie oldies helps keep the mood cheery, despite a literal vatful of blood."
1,"""100 Bloody Acres"" is gory good fun."
0,"Though entertaining enough as a genre exercise, the film is too simplistic to transcend its base concept."
1,"""100 Bloody Acres"" somehow manages to be both retro and up to date with its giddy, delightful gross-out horror-comedy mash-up storytelling."
1,"You'll laugh, you'll squirm."
1,"This fairly rote tale of rural ghouls and their passing-through prey has its own hick charm, mostly because of performers who never overplay their hands."
1,"It sounds appalling, but ""100 Bloody Acres"" has a spring in its step."
1,This is a smartly written and acted and exceptionally well-directed movie.
1,"100 Bloody Acres is as mercurial as its central character, breezily offbeat one moment, spattered in gonzo gore the next. It's as if the filmmakers ground the bits of other movies fine enough that it made a rich foundation for their own."
1,"100 Bloody Acres is yet another cheap'n'cheerful Australian comedy-horror film, made with gusto by Colin and Cameron Cairnes."
0,It's taken three years for this negligible Aussie splatterfest to get its one-weekend-only release; you wonder why anybody thought to rescue it.
0,"Given the talent involved, 100 Streets can't help but seem disappointing."
0,"100 Streets stars Idris Elba and Gemma Arterton, leading one to hope that this drama set in a square mile of Battersea might be gripping. Instead the film feels like a slice of a soap opera, dredging up every London clich챕."
0,"The film has some intriguing characters, subplots, situations. Frustratingly, though, the complete jigsaw doesn't fit together, hampered by plot implausibilities and unrealities."
0,It's never entirely clear why its three unrelated stories are being told in the first place.
0,"""A Hundred Streets"" seems oddly unequal to the status of its charismatic name cast, headlined by Idris Elba and Gemma Arterton."
1,Elba oozes charisma and intelligent physicality even when on his knees snorting a line of coke ...
1,It's a portrait of similar struggles existing in proximity of time and place; of individual battles being fought side by side yet alone.
0,It's six or so characters in search of a meaningful movie.
0,"The actors are fine, but the material doesn't give their talents much room to stretch."
0,"Though there's clearly a compassionate impulse behind Leon F. Butler's class-conscious screenplay, it rapidly devolves into implausible melodrama."
1,"There has been no shortage of interpretations of Conan Doyle's great detective over the years, but, with apologies to Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Cushing remains one of the greatest."
1,"Scares are not its strong suit, but it has a trim, bright look and better performances than might be expected."
1,House of Wax proves once and for all that true stereo combined with perfect color and directional sound is truly a visionary new and exciting medium.
1,De Toth brings off one classic sequence with Kirk fleeing through the gaslit streets pursued by a shadowy figure in a billowing cloak.
0,Dimly we foresee movie audiences embalmed in three-dimensional wax and sound.
1,"The effects are done with playfulness, zest, and some imagination (they range from a barker batting paddleballs in your face to a murderer leaping from the row in front of you), making this the most entertaining of the gimmick 3-Ds."
1,"Casting is competent, Vincent Price is capital as the No. 1 menace."
1,An intermittently gripping shocker.
0,A stale spook concoction from the William Castle-Robb White production team.
1,"If one had to pick the best of the campy horror films that made [Castle's] reputation, this 1958 feature would probably be it."
1,"There is some good humor in the dialog which not only pays off well against the ghostly elements, but provides a release for laughter so it does not explode in the suspense sequences."
1,"[House On Haunted Hill,] unlike the majority of recent horror films which have depended on mutilations or monsters for chills, reverts to the fundamental of the ghost story -- fear of the unknown."
0,"Martin Ritt directed, putting a little too much dust in the dust bowl for my taste."
1,One of Ritt's best films.
0,Where it falls short of the mark is in its failure to filter its meaning and theme lucidly through its characters and story.
1,"The four principal actors -- Newman, Neal, Douglas, and de Wilde -- are so good that they might well form the nucleus of a cinematic repertory company."
1,"This rigorous, compelling, radically stylized film represents the end point in a line of development that Otto Preminger had been pursuing since the late 60s."
0,"The self-torture demanded by Chaney's makeup is impressive, as are the scales of the sets and the crowd scenes, but nothing comes to life under the flat direction of Wallace Worsley."
1,"Worth seeing mainly for Chaney's remarkable performance; even bowed and constricted by the heavy weights he used to help simulate Quasimodo's crippled gait, his body remains extraordinarily expressive."
0,"Although it is an elaborate-studied piece of work, over which much time and many dollars have been spent, it makes no tumultuous call upon our enthusiasm."
0,"The Hunter bears all the marks of a tailor-made ""star vehicle,"" one of those awful movies catering to a star's ego and image."
1,
1,
1,"The movie careers by at a fast and cheeky pace. Its clues are strewn across a glossy landscape of city streets and pretty girls in various stages of dress and death by torture, and are delivered in an impenetrably gritty New York accent."
0,"The film soon becomes repetitious, lacking the overall atmosphere of paranoia that makes Spillane's fictions bearable."
1,"The souped-up remake is hard as nails, with Armand Assante plausibly macho and ruggedly sexy as the amoral private eye who avenges the murder of his old Vietnam war buddy."
1,"I, the Jury is a violent private eye thriller, with a certain redeeming sense of style."
0,"Apart from Assante and the random effective bit player -- notably Frederick Downs, a Veterans Administration official who plays the first murder victim, Jack Williams -- the level of acting tends to be perilously amateurish."
1,"Douglas Sirk's 1959 film was the biggest grosser in Universal's history until the release of Airport, yet it's also one of the most intellectually demanding films ever made in Hollywood."
1,Forget those who decry the '50s Hollywood melodrama; it is through the conventions of that hyper-emotional genre that Sirk is able to make such a devastatingly embittered and pessimistic movie.
0,This modernized remake of Miss Hurst's frankly lachrymose tale is much the same as its soggy predecessor. It is the most shameless tear-jerker in a couple of years.
1,
0,"While this device lends more scope, it also results in the overdone busy actress/neglected daughter conflict."
1,"Imitation of Life is still a potent onion. When passed before the moviegoer's eyes, it may force theater owners to install aisle scuppers to drain off the tears."
1,"The toughest-minded, most irresolvable movie ever made about race in this country."
1,"Sirk unleashed a melodramatic torrent of rage at the corrupt core of American life-the unholy trinity of racism, commercialism, and puritanism."
1,This edition of Imitation of Life should do as much for Miss Kohner as did the original movie for Miss Colbert in 1934.
0,"Anthony Asquith directs, occasionally aware he is making a movie."
1,"[T]he settings are the epitome of Victorian +hness, the colour is Technicolor at its fruitiest, and most of the playing is disarming, particularly Edith Evans and her handbag."
1,"Mr. Asquith and his top-flight English cast, aided greatly by an artistic use of Technicolor, not only treat this rickety affair with reverence, but endow the lines with charm in keeping with the period."
1,All the charm and glossy humor of Oscar Wilde's classic comedy emerges faithfully in this British production.
1,"The perfect cast - Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison, Margaret Rutherford - and the perfect director (Anthony Asquith) know just how seriously (not very) to take this amoral satire on society's falsity."
1,"Despite a few tweaks to Oscar Wilde's frighteningly witty play, director and writer Anthony Asquith serves up a truly delightful screen version of ""The Importance of Being Earnest."""
0,
1,"The movie is good to look at and painfully intense at times -- not so much when the plot is squeezing in, as when we're invited to identify with Russell when she's looking for trouble."
0,An uneasy mixture of facile Freudianism and 40s expressionism.
1,"Brooks' great achievement in the film is to portray Smith and Hickock as the unexceptional, dim-witted, morally adrift losers they were."
1,"Excellent quasidocumentary, which sends shivers down the spine while moving the viewer to ponder."
0,"In contrast to Capote, whose obsessive documentation of the pair's every act betrays his fear than he (and his readers) could well do something similar, Brooks explains and sympathises away their act as being unique to them."
1,"Hall's bleak vision, his gift for working with darkness and rain, rivals classic film noir of the 1940s and '50s in its visual mastery."
1,"A probing, sensitive, tasteful, balanced and suspenseful documentary-drama."
1,"Truman Capote's non-fiction masterwork gets the film noir treatment from director Richard Brooks, with a slow dissection of ""a crime that shocked a nation."""
1,"Capote's non-fiction novel brooded on the sheer pointless nightmare, and so does the film, to some extent; the killers' casual excitement at the prospect of murderous violence is still chilling."
1,"It's both a ""true crime"" movie and a poetic account of two young men who, by committing an act of unspeakable brutality, unleash the furies against themselves."
1,Blake and Wilson give wonderfully natural performances: eerie in their casual attitude to murder but endearing in their open natures. In Cold Blood doesn't judge them but doesn't excuse them.
1,"Here the New York setting gave way to Mayfair, and Donen piled on the civilised charm."
1,A thin but impishly gay and enchanting film.
1,"A beguiling love story delicately deranged by the complications of sophisticated comedy, Indiscreet is an expert film version of Norman Krasna's 1953 stage play, Kind Sir."
1,"A fine light comedy, with unexpected passages of seriousness, marked by the Donen touch in its adventurous visuals and vivacious performances."
1,"A funny, freewheeling version of Broadway's Kind Sir."
1,"""Indiscreet"" is short on plot but more than makes up for it in style."
1,"Tolerably gripping in its old-fashioned way, thanks chiefly to old pro performances from Tracy and March as the rival lawyers and ideologists."
0,"Spencer Tracy does his cuddly curmudgeon turn as Clarence Darrow; it's a lazy, vague performance, but its wit provides the only crack of light in the film's somber, gray overcast."
1,"One of the great breakthroughs -- the Ulysses of the cinema -- and a powerful, moving experience in its own right."
1,The verdict Intolerance renders in the controversy concerning its maker is that he is a real wizard of lens and screen.
1,"Intolerance reflects much credit to the wizard director, for it required no small amount of genuine art to consistently blend actors, horses, monkeys, geese, doves, acrobats and ballets into a composite presentation of a film classic."
1,"Intolerance looks both backward and forward. The strong exploit the weak, it cries, and all governments throughout history are evil."
1,Griffith's trademark closeups lend a quivering lip or a trembling hand the tragic grandeur of historical cataclysm.
1,"All at once the Moloch of cineastical good intentions, the first great juggernaut of auteur ambition, and the largest experimental film ever made."
1,"As a medium for expressing art, moving pictures may not stand the test of time, but Intolerance is greater than any medium. It is one of the mileposts on the long road of art."
1,Wonderfully performed and imbued with a genuine sense of trepidation and unease.
1,"It's still a chilling picture, gaining over Phil Kaufman's smart remake by virtue of its intimate small town setting, and it has one of the greatest endings ever filmed."
1,"Don Siegel's superb little effort, with its matter-of-fact isolation of hero Kevin McCarthy (ironic, no?) from the smarmy complacency of a small town gone to hell -- and way beyond -- points the way to his gripping action films of the 60s and 70s."
1,"This tense, offbeat piece of science-fiction is occasionally difficult to follow due to the strangeness of its scientific premise. Action nevertheless is increasingly exciting."
1,Few modern-day movies are more genuinely frightening.
1,"This modest, sci-fi-inflected 1956 horror movie may come to be seen as the defining metaphorical work of the twentieth century."
1,A movie that can claim kinship with Alberto Cavalcanti's Went the Day Well? as well as The Matrix and Under the Skin.
1,A film whose righteous anger is visible in its every frame.
1,"Brilliantly placed, however unwittingly, to illustrate America's political paranoia from both ends."
1,"""You fools! You're in danger! Can't you see? They're after you! They're after all of us!"" It's one of the greatest lines in sci-fi movie history, from one of the greatest films, Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
1,[Kaufman] weaves an increasingly sinister cityscape through prowling camerawork and a highly effective stereo score.
1,"There's a little something extra in virtually every frame of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Philip Kaufman's dazzling remake of one of the cleverest of horror classics."
1,"Kaufman here turns in his most Movie Brattish film, but soft-pedals on both his special effects and knowing in-jokiness in a way that puts De Palma to shame."
1,"Ideas that Siegel knocked off in a few shots are expanded to fill entire sequences -- but they're good ideas, and can stand a little stretching."
1,"Set at the intersection of post-Vietnam paranoia and the myopic introspection that became hippiedom's most lasting cultural contribution, the Philip Kaufman-directed Invasion alternates social commentary with impeccably crafted scares."
1,Invasion of the Body Snatchers validates the entire concept of remakes.
0,"This film wants to have it both ways: to have a more urbane, more ""important"" scope than the original, and yet retain some of its inexpensive intimacy as well."
1,Gives remakes a good name.
1,"It's interesting to observe how Kaufman and screenwriter W.D. Richter contrive to exploit and refine elements from both Finney's novel and Siegel's film in the new movie version, an unusually imaginative and adroit but also self-conscious remake."
1,"The many special effects -- some retouched on film by hand -- are quaint by today's digital standards, but that only makes them all the more fun."
1,"It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the performances of the cast beyond saying that they all rise to the demands of their parts. As for the settings, they seem very real, and the direction and acting of the uniformed police force are unusually good."
1,"Rains, with his clear, sensitively inflected voice, was lucky: it made him a star."
1,James Whale's 1933 film plays more like a British folk comedy than a horror movie; it's full of the same deft character twists that made his Bride of Frankenstein a classic.
1,The strangest character yet created by the screen roams through The Invisible Man.
1,"In his first cinema role, which must have been easy for him to play since it amounts to very little more than an offstage noise, Claude Rains gives an alarming performance, almost as frightening when he is present as when he is not."
0,Mr. Wells's original idea had the element of humour as well as stark terror in it; in the film the humour misses all its glorious opportunities and the terror is robbed.
1,"Under the supervision of James Whale, the director of ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Old Dark House"" the doings of the Invisible Man have been set forth with extraordinary realism."
1,A marvel of film technique.
1,The performers display a kind of disciplined intelligence that keeps them from bursting through the style of the film into comic limbo.
0,"Only Michael York's metamorphosis into a beast has any impact, and the film predictably fails to follow through even on that."
1,"Lancaster, despite his ungodly ideas, is given some resonance as a man who thinks his demented work is for the betterment of the human race. York gives one of his best performances, and Barbara Carrera's enigmatic beauty is evocatively treated."
1,"Islands in the Stream is a big, strong, old-fashioned movie about that threatened species, the Hemingway Hero."
1,A real treat.
0,"Unfortunately, the salesgirl who is supposed to have ""it"" must strike educated beholders as a rather vapid hoyden."
1,"As Ivanhoe, Robert Taylor does a good, sturdy, manly job and George Sanders is intriguingly fluid as the emotionally torn De Bois-Guilbert."
1,"The dialogue and script are fatuously Americanised from Scott's original, but these chivalric Hollywood sagas still have a strange poetic quality about them."
1,"Ivanhoe is a great romantic adventure, mounted extravagantly, crammed with action, and emerges as a spectacular feast."
0,"Jack Frost features some marvelously cracked creations... but the 1979 special's fairy-tale structure and flimsy integration of Groundhog Day folklore make for a bloated, quasi-magical mess."
0,"Nearing the absolute maximum threshold for strange, vaguely European mythical spirits and the dark magic they wield, ""Jack Frost"" is certainly more screwed up than it is festive."
1,The animators kept the borscht belt humor coming... in a fable that fits right in with the bedtime stories of Hans Christian Andersen.
0,"Having set his own standards, Alfred Hitchcock must be judged by them; and, by them, his Jamaica Inn is merely journeyman melodrama."
0,"The result is weird, but not wonderful."
1,"Superb direction, excellent casting, expressive playing and fine production offset an uneven screenplay to make Jamaica Inn a gripping version of the Daphne du Maurier novel."
0,"By common consent, one of Alfred Hitchcock's poorest and least personal works, though it has some compensations."
1,"Laughton is compelling from the first instant: His Pengallan is at least five of the seven deadly sins rolled into one, a cheerfully loathsome creature with wide-set eyebrows and a multitude of chins ..."
0,"The straight story of Jason's exploits, told with magic and imagination and a minimum of studio trickery, might have been delightful. This version is more bull than Bulfinch."
0,"This absurd, unwieldy adventure -- if that's the word -- is no worse, but certainly no better, than most of its kind."
1,"Great fun, as these things go, with a Bernard Herrmann score to boot."
1,"The $3 million film has a workable scenario and has been directed resourcefully and spiritedly by Don Chaffey, under whose leadership a colorful cast performs with zeal."
1,"Special-effects buffs generally cite this 1963 effort by Ray Harryhausen as the master's masterpiece, and his work does a great deal to enliven the tired plot and vacuous stars."
0,"It's ragged and dull until the magical moment when Jolson turns to the camera to announce, 'You ain't heard nothin' yet' -- a line so loaded with unconscious irony that it still raises a few goose bumps."
1,The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly.
1,Undoubtedly the best thing Vitaphone has ever put on the screen.
1,In cities where the Vitaphone can be installed and reproduce his voice this picture will eminently repay attendance.
1,"Richard Fleischer's direction is appropriately close-in and small, and Diamond himself, while no actor, proves to be a commandingly intense, brooding presence."
0,"Mr. Diamond, looking glum and seldom making eye contact with anyone, isn't enough of a focus for the outmoded story."
0,The Jazz Singer has so many things wrong with it that a review threatens to become a list.
0,The most cautious soft-rock superstar movie debut you'll ever get to see.
1,"Jewison, a director of large talent, has taken a piece of commercial shlock and turned it into a Biblical movie with dignity."
0,"Despite the 'impressive' desert locations and an array of tanks (to represent the ills of modern militarism), it's still staged like a student revue."
0,"The music quickly becomes monotonous, and the operatic dialogue is silly right from the start."
1,Nostalgic homage to Louis Feuillade's silent serials.
1,A stirring and memorable film.
1,A remarkably successful stab at Shakespeare.
1,The best Shakespeare that Hollywood has yet produced.
1,"A tense, melodramatic story, clearly presented, and excellently acted by one of the finest casts assembled for a film."
1,Unimaginative but intelligent.
1,"Over Caesar's corpse Brando begins to mix grief, rage, cunning, and ferocity; his reading of the funeral oration is so quakingly angry you understand why it would rouse the rabble."
0,We begin to suspect... that the movie is an alien plot to drain the soul from mighty Shakespeare.
1,[Director Stuart Burge] has taken a pragmatic view even of the poetry; his is a virile drama of men making the most of their moments and making the world move with them.
0,"The color is strikingly vivid and some of the individual scenes have natural charm. But the film, as a whole, is ostentatious."
0,"It's a formless, often dull time, but the verdant Technicolor (shot by Lee Garmes) gives it a nice gloss."
1,"As directed by Zoltan Korda, the fiction takes secondary place to the highly interesting and sometimes amazing views of jungle animals in the brilliance of colored photography."
0,"When the animals are talking their own language and roaming their improvised jungle near Los Angeles, Jungle Book is as absorbing as a behind-the-scenes trip to the zoo. But when they converse in Kipling's English, the result is painful."
0,"The story and the values are so resolutely old-fashioned, and in such a formula way, that I was almost amused. If this movie had been made in the 1940s with Mickey Rooney, it would have felt just right."
1,"Don't see it for psychological complexity, social comment, acting, plot or humour; go, if you must, just for kicks."
0,"Combine Karate Kid and Rocky with a bit more blood and gore, dull direction and a smattering of inept actors and you have Kickboxer."
0,"This may not be the dumbest action picture of the year, but it's not for lack of trying."
0,"The Killer Elite is directed and acted with a certain nice style, but it puts us through so many convolutions of the plot that finally we just don't care."
0,Sam Peckinpah knows how to make movies but perhaps he has forgotten why.
0,
1,"If you don't...see [The King and I], believe us, you'll be missing a grand and moving thing."
1,Over-long but visually spectacular.
1,All the ingredients that made Rodgers & Hammerstein's The King and I a memorable stage experience have been faithfully transferred to the screen.
0,Typically overproduced.
1,"King Kong was created to grip and thrill like no movie before, and these basic principles hold surprisingly true today."
1,"Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about King Kong that still somehow works."
1,"Through multiple exposures, processed 'shots' and a variety of angles of camera wizardry the producers set forth an adequate story and furnish enough thrills for any devotee of such tales."
1,
1,"In many ways, Kong is still king."
1,"The throbbing heart of the film lies in the creation of the semi-human simian himself, an immortal tribute to the Hollywood dream factory..."
1,"Kong mystifies as well as it horrifies, and may open up a new medium for scaring babies via the screen."
1,"Willis O'Brien did the stop-action animation for this 1933 feature, which is richer in character than most of the human cast."
1,"It might seem that any creature answering the description of Kong would be despicable and terrifying. Such is not the case. Kong is an exaggeration ad absurdum, too vast to be plausible. This makes his actions wholly enjoyable."
1,"""King Kong,"" as spectacular a bolt of celluloid as has thrilled audiences in a couple of sophisticated seasons, is the product of a number of vivid imaginations."
1,"The story, like Frankenstein and Dracula, has taken on the significance of a modern folk tale, layered with obvious moralizing and as familiar as personal history."
1,"[Fay] Wray has never been more beautiful before the camera, nor acted as well as she does in this production."
1,"Common wisdom contends that Dino De Laurentiis' big-budget remake of Merian C. Cooper's classic 1933 film, King Kong, is a bad movie. And, viewed from a certain perspective, perhaps it is, but it's also a lot of fun."
1,
0,"What sort, exactly, is this movie?"
1,The results of this technological bonanza are pretty mixed.
1,"Faithful in substantial degree not only to the letter but also the spirit of the 1933 classic for RKO, this $22 million-+ version neatly balances superb special effects with solid dramatic credibility."
1,"The special effects are marvelous, the good-humored script is comic-bookish without being excessively campy, and there are two excellent performances"
1,"It's madness to try to remake a myth, but even so, John Guillermin's jokey, low-camp film seems awfully inadequate."
1,"It's Martin Scorsese's second least popular movie, after The Last Temptation of Christ. Which is a shame, because it's Scorsese's second greatest film, after Taxi Driver."
1,"It's very funny, and it ends on a high note that was, for me, both a total surprise and completely satisfying. Yet it's also bristly, sometimes manic to the edge of lunacy and, along the way, terrifying."
1,"Creepiest movie of the year in every sense, and one of the best."
1,"The uncenteredness of the film is irritating, though it's irritating in an ambitious, risk-taking way."
0,"To be sure, Robert De Niro turns in another virtuoso performance for Martin Scorsese, just as in their four previous efforts. But once again -- and even more so -- they come up with a character that it's hard to spend time with."
1,"It is frustrating to watch, unpleasant to remember, and, in its own way, quite effective."
1,"A disturbing picture of a world in which television is taken for a ""reality"" higher than everyday life, it's also darkly funny."
0,"The King of Comedy fancies itself a scathing social satire about the lust for celebrity carried to extremes. But ultimately, director Martin Scorsese's movie is a severely misconceived and distasteful study of delusional behavior."
1,"Brilliantly keeps viewers unmoored, the result of its consistently off-kilter tone."
1,Scorsese infuses this tale with the passionate energy of New York street life and an outsider's wonder at the powerful workings of show business and studio craft.
0,"Scorsese is capable of building tension, but what is he trying to achieve? A comedy about the nature of fame? But he evokes only the most nervous of laughter."
1,This quirky 'Scope biblical spectacular is a lot more thoughtful and interesting than most.
0,Let us say the spirit is hinted but the projection of it is weak.
1,This is one of the most interesting screen versions of the Gospels.
1,"Director Nicholas Ray has brooded long and wisely upon the meaning of his meanings, has planted plenty of symbols along the path, yet avoided the banalities of religious calendar art."
0,Director Nicholas Ray makes few positive contributions.
1,"Just in under the wire to challenge for a place on the year's best ten is The Lady Vanishes, latest of the melodramatic classics made by England's greatest director, Alfred Hitchcock."
1,"Very much of its time (in a good way), and very enjoyable."
1,"This is vintage Hitchcock, with the pacing and superb editing that marked not only his 30s style but eventually every film that had any aspirations whatever to achieving suspense and rhythm."
1,What separates Lady Vanishes
1,Both a neat comment on Britain's dilemma in the build-up to the impending war with Germany (to appease or not to appease?) and also a cracking piece of entertainment.
1,A pleasure.
1,"This film, - the deft and artistic handling of the director, Alfred Hitchcock, despite its cast and photography, would not stand up for Grade A candidacy."
1,"The Lady Vanishes exhibits Director Alfred Hitchcock, England's portly master of melodrama, at the top of his form."
1,
1,One of the great Ealing comedies of the 1950s.
1,"The materials of a B-grade crime potboiler are redeemed by Waldo Lydecker, walking through every scene as if afraid to step in something."
1,The picture on the whole is close to being a top-drawer mystery.
1,"The plot is deliberately perfunctory, the people deliciously perverse, and the mise-en-scne radical."
1,"Less a crime film than a study in levels of obsession, Laura is one of those classic works that leave their subject matter behind and live on the strength of their seductive style."
1,A hypnotic and deathlessly interpretable experience.
1,Gene Tierney makes an appealing figure as the art executive and Vincent Price is convincing as a weak-willed ne'er-do-well.
1,A highly polished and debonair whodunit.
1,"Few movies make you feel dirtier, and so perversely grateful for the pleasure."
1,Laura is still every bit as gripping in 2012.
1,"Not only one of Preminger's greatest, but one of the great noirs."
1,
1,Will leave you drunk with delight.
0,"Like many recent sword and sorcery movies, it is so effective in rendering evil, so good at depicting the dire, bleak fates facing the heroes, that it's too dreary and gloomy for its own good."
0,Ridley Scott has done better.
0,"Beautifully shot and designed, but in a cloyingly self-conscious manner, the film lacks narrative drive."
0,"Legend is a fairytale produced on a grand scale... At the same time, the basic premise is alarmingly thin, a compendium of any number of ancient fairytales."
1,"Legend is not without whimsical touches, but it surely could have used more humor and invention."
0,You are caught up in a morality play... the deepest significance of which the makers of this PG movie are apparently betting the adolescents of America will instinctively comprehend.
0,I don't want to remember any more about Legend than to make sure I include it in my ''worst films of 1986'' list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette.
0,"Legend may turn out to be legendary, but not in the way the filmmakers intended."
1,"Nominated for the Best Picture oscar, Boleslawki's adpaptation of the Victor Hugo famous novel is lavishly mounted and well acted by Fredric March and Charles Laughton"
1,"Charles Laughton in the part of Javert gave it as much character merely because the character as written was eminent, giving a balance to the whole story."
1,"It isn't a bad example of the Hollywood prestige picture -- there is, at least, some liveliness in the performances."
0,"It might be significant as an early independent movie made good, but Poitier got better when he got angrier for In the Heat of the Night four years later."
1,"Many factors combine in the overall success of the film, notably the restrained direction by Ralph Nelson, a thoroughly competent screenplay by James Poe, and, of course, Poitier's own standout performance."
0,Well-meaning rot.
1,"Lilies of the Field is a funny, sentimental, charming and uplifting film, in which intelligence, imagination and energy are proved again to be beyond the price of any super-budget."
1,"One of the most revered films of all time...with hallmark performances from Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn and the film debuts of Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton, Nigel Terry and John Castle."
1,One of the joys which movies provide too rarely is the opportunity to see a literate script handled intelligently. The Lion in Winter triumphs at that difficult task...
1,"...outdoorsy and fun, full of the kind of plotting and action people used to go to just plain movies for."
1,"Harvey's direction is intelligent enough, though the reduction of power struggles to fits of personal pique -- where the fate of nations hangs in the balance -- becomes a little irritating. Enjoyable for its two lead performances, however."
1,"Director Anthony Harvey opened up Goldman's play into authentic spaces far from any proscenium, and remained faithful to an energetic drama propelled by its performances and dialogue."
1,"An intense, fierce, personal drama put across by outstanding performances of Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn."
0,"Henry and Eleanor are reduced to a TV-sized version of the sovereigns next door, their epic struggle shrunk to sitcom squabbles."
0,"James Goldman's screenplay, so chic and sophisticated to the ears of suburbanites, is chock-full of the worst kind of sophomoric fiddling with what Goldman takes to be genuine highfalutin lingo."
1,[A] humdinger of medieval powerplay.
1,"All that's ever mattered about The Lion in Winter are Hepburn and O'Toole, and the pleasure we take from watching two masters inspire each other to greatness. Scenery chewing has rarely been so artful."
0,"I thought ""Rudolph"" was the worst animation I had seen, until seeing Drummer Boy again. Aaron the misanthropic drummer, formerly with Metallica, and his animal friends skitter across the Sinai like cockroaches on Red Bull."
1,A Christmas children's special that actually depicts events from the Bible? What a concept!
1,"A poignant third act restores his faith in humanity, all the while making up for some of the roughest animation work in the Videocraft catalogue."
1,"Emotionally, it's a notch or two more mature than the usual Rankin-Bass production."
1,"It's a lot like How The Grinch Stole Christmas, in other words, only with a Biblical foundation and not so much rhyming. The special is effective as all get-out, too."
1,A genuine charmer.
0,It gives us two movie kids in a story so unlikely I assume it was intended as a fantasy. And it gives us dialog and situations so relentlessly cute we want to squirm.
0,A Little Romance is so ponderous it seems almost mean spirited.
0,It's not one that'll win over hardened cynics.
1,"Fulcrum in script is the beneficent boulevardier, limned by Laurence Olivier in a modern refashioning of the old Maurice Chevalier role."
1,"The film's portrait of young love may be touching, but its most moving moments celebrate love of a different kind: the passion that movie professionals, both young and old, have for their craft."
0,"Thanks to the heavy synthetic hand of director George Roy Hill, the potentially charming aspects of th kids' infatuation curdle into syrupy gruel."
0,"The intentional comedy in the film always seems on the verge of working, but then is quickly bludgeoned to death."
1,"I have seen a lot of musicals (probably more than most people under the age of 50), and few are as lively and fun as Little Shop of Horrors."
1,"Screen writer and lyricist Howard Ashman has mastered the essence of '80s humor, recycling the old with a hip knowingness, all with a morbid, outrageous edge."
1,"The movie doesn't labor its jokes or insist on its virtuoso special effects, but devotes its energies to seeming unforced and delightful."
1,"With its toe-tapping cadences, its class cast and its king-sized cabbage, it's destined to become a classic of camp comedy."
1,"A full-blown movie musical, and quite a winning one."
1,This wild and witty musical is great fun.
1,"You can try not liking this adaptation of the Off-Broadway musical hit -- it has no polish and a pushy way with a gag -- but the movie sneaks up on you, about as subtly as Audrey II."
1,"A fractured, funny production transported rather reluctantly from the stage to the screen."
1,The best moments in this 1987 release belong to Dr. Steve Martin as a dentist with a professional yen for pain.
1,"Levi Stubbs's big voice explodes from the insatiable plant, and there's a knockout turn by Steve Martin and Bill Murray as a sadistic dentist and his masochistic patient."
1,The film begins in a gentle fashion and slips away smoothly without any forced attempt to help the finish to linger in the minds of the audience.
1,"Cukor mines a rich vein of sentiment, never over-stepping the mark into slush, but it is Hepburn's Jo, making a subversive choice of what she wants her life to be, who ensures that the cosiness isn't everything."
1,"[An] intelligent, grown up rendition of the Louisa Alcott classic."
0,"If anything, it has hauled back much too briskly on the strings of the heart and has strained a few muscles in the process. Its consequent agony shows."
1,"The tender story, with its frank and unashamed assault on the emotions, still has its effective moments at times when the sentiment doesn't grow a little too thick."
1,"A shade less ambitious than its 1933 predecessor (which starred Katharine Hepburn and Joan Bennett), it still jerks tears with easy efficiency."
1,"The picture has a rare power, a garbled but often moving push toward an off-beat communication."
1,Far more satisfying than his later works (one hesitates to call them mere movies).
1,"Where Nabokov was witty, Kubrick is sometimes merely snide, but fine performances (particularly from Peter Sellers, as the ominous Clare Quilty) cover most of the rough spots."
0,An occasionally amusing but shapeless film.
1,"For what they have set out to do, Mr. Lumet and the producer, Ely Landau, have given us a fine, fair picture of a tough and maybe tedious O'Neill play."
1,"The result is inevitably a bit stagey, especially Hepburn's more histrionic moments. Yet the psychological insight is acute, the tone searingly dark."
0,[An] uneasy blend of three Faulkner short stories.
0,"The Long, Hot Summer starts superbly and ends in a senseless, flabby heap."
1,"The ending is an unconvincing cop out, but it can't spoil the film's compulsive dramatic tension (or a marvellous comic cameo from Angela Lansbury as Welles' long-suffering mistress)."
1,This picture is strikingly directed by Martin Ritt.
1,"Newman's performance as Ben Quick, before the script blunts it, is as mean and keen as a cackle-edge scythe."
1,The lengthy football game is one of the most enjoyable sporting events ever put on film.
0,"Though The Yard is a terrible picture, I'll admit to having unwillingly enjoyed some of the football practice and parts of the final game -- even though it's much too long."
1,"Very exciting, very witty, and elevated above its action-movie status by Aldrich's deliberate references to Nixon in Albert's characterisation of the warden."
1,"An outstanding action drama, combining the brutish excitement of football competition with the brutalities of contemporary prison life."
1,"What saves it, aside from good performances by Burt Reynolds and a thundering herd of supporting grotesques, is, of all things, a tough, tiny nut of valid social criticism."
1,"There's no doubt that Richard Burton gives some firepower to those famous rant speeches, arias of self-hate and rage that might otherwise be overpoweringly shrill and petulant."
0,What this autopopathism means in terms of American culture is a subject I neither understand nor wish to.
0,"Such a vulnerable movie that if it were a little less sappy, one might feel compelled to protect it, as if it were someone under 7 or over 65 -- that portion of the public for which it is intended."
1,'Herbie' and his plucky stunt drivers steal the show in this agreeable family entertainment.
1,"For sheer inventiveness of situation and the charm that such an idea projects, The Love Bug rates as one of the better entries of the Disney organization."
0,The Love Bug is surely the first film in which the actors...are so meticulously insipid that a car can handily steal the show.
1,It's an impeccable film -- a model of psychological suspense and a stunning display of Lang's power and skill.
1,This astonishing movie represents an unsurpassed grand synthesis of storytelling.
1,Lorre's performance as a desperate killer who insists he can't help himself remains his finest hour on film.
1,"The film doesn't ask for sympathy for the killer Franz Becker, but it asks for understanding: As he says in his own defense, he cannot escape or control the evil compulsions that overtake him."
1,[An] important film which rightly deserves its success.
1,"A subversive film, or more simply a movie brimming over with the ferment of Lang's imagination at its height? You choose."
1,"An extraordinary, good, impressive and strong talker. Again fine work by Fritz Lang, and his wife and helper, Thea von Harbou."
1,"The moral issues are complex and deftly handled: Lorre is at once entirely innocent and absolutely evil. Lang's detached, modified expressionist style gives the action a plastic beauty."
1,"Put simply, without M to show the way, there might have been no subsequent films in which a hidden killer unmasks the ills of the society around him"
1,"This is a movie that dares to sympathize with a sick person, that risks making the monster real and us (in an era when Germany's cinema was still shellacked in canted angles and fanciful shadows)."
1,"Few films are gripping and effective 82 years after their original release, but this one surely is."
1,"It is a cousin to the early Hitchcock of The Lodger, and I have always found something even something faintly Ealingesque about its cynicism and satire."
1,You'll never look at a novelty balloon in the same way again.
1,"Our identification with [Lorre] as a psychopath is so complete it's hard to believe that while appearing before Fritz Lang's cameras in the daytime, he was, at night, acting as a comedian in a farce."
1,"Lang's movie is that rare thing, a nail-biting soul-searcher. While M steers clear of analyzing deviance, it is startling in its musings on which punishment fits an inhuman crime."
1,"Be afraid. Be properly afraid. The greatest creation of Fritz Lang's career remains one of the most disturbing movies of his, or any, film-making era."
0,Made in Heaven is original and even spellbinding in the scenes set in heaven. It finds nothing new to say about earth.
1,"An absolutely dazzling film entertainment, so full of beauty, intelligence, wit, and fun that it becomes a testimonial not only to man's possibilities but also to his high spirits."
1,Ingmar Bergman's mounting of the Mozart masterpiece is appealingly conventional.
1,The intelligence and clarity of Bergman's The Magic Flute is a marvel.
1,"Using the opera's timeless whimsy and inventiveness, the movie replicates a performance on the stage that is so good that it almost makes you forget the participants' ABBA-like hairstyles."
1,"Ingmar Bergman's version of Mozart's The Magic Flute isn't his most cinematic work - it's a film version of an opera and was originally shown on Swedish TV. Nonetheless, there are elements here which echo his other films."
1,"Ingmar Bergman has never before made a movie so warm, happy and innocent... It's as if all this joy has been building up inside him during the great decade of metaphysical films beginning with Persona."
1,"Even with so many cuts reducing the final third to a frustrating mish-mash of disjointed segments, it retains the occasional power to mesmerize and amaze."
1,"Welles' technical brilliance shines through, securing the film its classic status."
1,A pretty sensational movie.
1,I must say that I much prefer it to Citizen Kane (1941). So sue me.
1,"Hacked about by a confused RKO, Welles' second film (from the novel by Booth Tarkington) still looks a masterpiece."
1,"All in all, The Magnificent Ambersons is an exceptionally well-made film, dealing with a subject scarcely worth the attention which has been lavished upon it."
1,The emotional sense of America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is so palpable you can taste it.
1,A masterpiece in every way (but ignore the awkward ending the studio tacked on without Welles's approval).
0,"Orson Welles devotes 9,000 feet of film to a spoiled brat who grows up as a spoiled, spiteful young man. This film hasn't a single moment of contrast; it piles on and on a tale of woe, but without once striking at least a true chord of sentimentality."
1,"Although reams have been written about the mutilation of Orson Welles' second feature, what remains of it is nevertheless a major accomplishment."
0,"While telling this story, haltingly and clumsily, the movie runs from burdensome through heavy and dull to bad. It stutters and stumbles as Welles submerges Tarkington's story in a mess of radio and stage technique."
1,"Ambersons is not another Citizen Kane, but it is good enough to remove Director Welles for keeps from the novice or one-picture-prodigy class."
1,Even in this truncated form it's amazing and memorable.
1,"Film snobs like to say that this, the second feature from Orson Welles, is even better than Citizen Kane. That's a stretch, but it's certainly exquisitely beautiful film-making - there are frames in there to die for."
1,The Magnificent Seven emerges as not only ludicrously enjoyable entertainment but also a superior and thoughtful character study.
0,"Even with some highly fetching Mexican scenery in color, this United Artists release, thrusting Yul Brynner well to the fore, is a pallid, pretentious and overlong reflection of the Japanese original."
1,"Sturges' remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is always worth a look, mainly for the performances of McQueen, Bronson, Coburn and Vaughn."
1,"There is a heap of fine acting and some crackling good direction by John Sturges mostly in the early stages, during formation of the central septet."
1,This film may well be the best western of 1960.
0,What was wonderful in the Kurosawa film -- the recruiting and training of the mercenaries -- is just dead time here.
0,"About two-thirds of the film is good, tough, unromantic period western. About one-third is sentimental nonsense and it bushwhacks the remainder... In adding so-called commercial values, a good picture has been sabotaged."
0,"The movie just doesn't have the life, the zaniness, this kind of screwball material demands."
1,"The plot is reminiscent of 1930 s comedies, but Streisand and [producer] Jon Peters have provided a handsome, up-to-date production."
1,"Among the movies we not only love but treasure, The Maltese Falcon stands as a great divide."
1,Mr. Huston gives promise of becoming one of the smartest directors in the field.
1,"Filmed almost entirely in interiors, it presents a claustrophobic world animated by betrayal, perversion and pain."
1,Who can argue with Bogart's glower or Mary Astor in her ratty fur?
1,This is one of the best examples of actionful and suspenseful melodramatic story telling in cinematic form.
1,"The Maltese Falcon is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system -- as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane."
1,"Frighteningly good evidence that the British (Alfred Hitchcock, Carol Reed, et al.) have no monopoly on the technique of making mystery films."
1,"The Maltese Falcon is the first crime melodrama with finish, speed and bang to come along in what seems ages."
1,"On a number of accounts it is distinguished celluloid entertainment, but it is of great interest to the trade because it reveals, in startling terms, the unheralded talent of topflight scenarist, John Huston."
1,"A Man for All Seasons is a picture that inspires admiration, courage and thought."
0,Orson Welles alone relieves the boredom in a marvellous cameo as Cardinal Wolsey. If only they'd let him loose with the whole sorry history...
0,"Robert Bolt's boring historical drama functions best as an anthology of British acting styles, circa 1966."
1,"Producer-director Fred Zinnemann has blended all filmmaking elements into an excellent, handsome and stirring film version of A Man For All Seasons."
1,One of the most intelligent religious movies ever made.
0,"There's more than a little of the school pageant in the rhythm of the movie: Though it's all neater than our school drama coaches could make it, the figures group and say their assigned lines and move on."
1,"It is profoundly stirring in its dramatic conception, appealing as it does to the mind, heart, eye and ear."
1,"Has an excoriating, destabilizing wit that seems as knowingly sophisticated today as it must have then."
1,Not a moment of The Manchurian Candidate lacks edge and tension and a cynical spin.
1,"Its story of Cold War intrigue, murky East-West dealings, assassination, brainwashing -- and the idea of a glorified cue-card reader playing president -- resonates today like never before."
1,This genuinely frightening and daring film blew holes in the political complacency of post-war American cinema.
0,"The Manchurian Candidate pops up with a rash supposition that could serve to scare some viewers half to death -- that is, if they should be dupes enough to believe it, which we solemnly trust they won't."
1,A masterpiece.
1,"powerful experience, alternately corrosive with dark parodic humor, suspenseful, moving, and terrifying."
1,"Every once in a rare while a film comes along that works in all departments, with story, production and performance so well blended that the end effect is one of nearly complete satisfaction. Such is The Manchurian Candidate."
1,Don't bother with Jonathan Demme's toothless 2004 remake; the rereleased classic cold war thriller from 1962 by John Frankenheimer packs a harder punch.
1,"The direction and acting are good, so interest is maintained. Frankeheimer's handling of the early sequences, in which he attempts and succeeds in creating on film the corruption of the mind, is imaginative filmmaking."
1,"A clever, funny and very skillful thriller about how the kid builds his own atomic bomb."
1,An unpleasantly gripping thriller that rubs one's nose in a sick criminal mentality for two hours.
1,"This is a truly suspenseful, stylish thriller, sadly overlooked since the Oscar-winning The Silence of the Lambs."
1,The movie drives along with such intensity for much of the time that you can just let it work on your senses without worrying about whether it makes sense.
1,One of the most impressive American thrillers of the late '80s.
1,Manhunter ushered in the age of empathy for the devil.
1,"I'm intrigued by that stylistic envelope: simultaneously hypnotic and enervating, meditative and empty."
1,"... ""Manhunter"" is a gory and gorgeous cop thriller..."
1,What follows is some sort of combination of a teen-age Bewitched and a Police Academy for department stores.
0,"First-time director Michael Gottlieb proves a graceless sitcom talent, and McCarthy's reduction to chipmunkery hardly qualifies as a significant career stretch."
0,"You could say the plot thickens, but that would be overstating things in this simple-minded, screwball love story."
0,"In place of a real story, there is just the spectacle of stock characters being put through their paces to fill up the time. Several of those stock characters play upon racial and sexual stereotypes, and a few are drawn along obnoxiously homophobic lines."
0,"A film about, by and for dummies."
0,Mannequin is as stiff and spiritless as its title suggests.
0,"This movie is a real curiosity. It's dead. I don't mean it's bad. A lot of bad movies are fairly throbbing with life. Mannequin is dead. The wake lasts 1 1/2 hours, and then we can leave the theater."
0,"There`s some solid talent here, but Gottlieb's overemphatic direction reduces them all to broad caricature -- the kind of crazed mugging that isn't often seen outside the boundaries of Saturday morning kiddie shows."
0,"It's as if the film makers had the aspirations of classy old-style Hollywood hacks, but not their tricks: They don't know in which dummies the gold is buried."
1,"Douglas Fairbanks's first great acrobatic epic, from 1920, set the standard for zesty swashbucklers."
1,"A warm and winning film, full of the sort of candid comment on plain, drab people that seldom reaches the screen."
1,It does have doggy charm and a certain perceptiveness.
1,"Paddy Chayevsky's script, adapted from his own TV play, shows his flair for dialogue at its best, and the film manages to be touching, if minor."
1,"It's a warm, human, sometimes sentimental and an enjoyable experience."
1,"Ernest Borgnine as Marty lives up to all the promise he showed as the sadist in From Here to Eternity, and at the same time brilliantly shatters the type-cast he molded for himself in that picture."
1,"It is a sentimental, heart-warming, simple story of a couple of ugly ducklings who find compensation for their lack of good looks in each other's love."
1,It gives an utterly authentic picture of life in the New York Bronx district... while at the same time carrying us away by a love story that in its simple manner is more touching than many of the screen's more glamorous ones.
1,"When speaking about Marty, Chayefsky called it ""the most ordinary love story in the world."" Therein lies its appeal."
1,"That's what happens, all right, but what really happens is a lot more complicated. Because Masquerade depends upon its many surprises, I won't reveal any more of the plot."
0,The funny thing is that this sounds more interesting than it is.
1,"Stern in its intimations of the terrible consequences of war, this film is a haunting and affecting, as well as a rewarding, drama to have at this time."
1,"Even in his first movie, Brando's ability to transcend mediocre material is very much in evidence."
1,"Producer Stanley Kramer turns to the difficult cinematic subject of paraplegics, so expertly treated as to be sensitive, moving and yet, withal, entertaining and earthy-humored."
1,"The Men is a profoundly moving film, mainly because it bears a resemblance to life that is rare in Hollywood films."
0,"The suspense is sludgy and the character development nil; even the inadvertent comedy is spotty. The spectacle of Manhattan's demolition is interesting enough, but there's a lot of time-killing before the city actually goes up in flames."
0,See it on peril of death by boredom.
0,Meteor really combines several disasters in one continuous cinematic bummer.
1,Few films have ever been more visually exhilarating.
1,Essential viewing.
1,A movie whose graphic intelligence is exceeded only by its conceptual audacity.
1,Catch it wherever and whenever it plays. It incarnates the idea of the Big City as a manifestation of modernism.
1,"Far from a historical curio, Metropolis arrives, three-quarters of a century late, like an artifact from the future."
1,"The great thing is that despite the over-the-top acting, the makeup that doesn't know when to stop, the preciousness of so many of the compositions (Lang was nothing if not inventive), this is a great old movie-movie."
1,"Trashy and glorious, the restored Metropolis is a pop epic for the ages."
1,"A masterpiece of art direction, the movie has influenced our vision of the future ever since."
1,None of the film's many imitators has achieved something this immediately magnificent.
1,The eye-popping design and sense of scale remains as fresh and vital as it was in 1927.
1,"A great artist contains multitudes, and Lang packed a host of contradictory longings into a single allegory."
1,"After 75 years, Fritz Lang's Metropolis still stands as an icon of the silent era."
1,"See it on the big screen while you can, or risk the wrath of Moloch."
1,One of filmdom's major must-sees.
1,"The restoration eliminates nearly all the distracting cracks and splices and stabilizes images that were previously jittery, allowing us to admire them in all their complex glory."
1,Unmissable.
1,"The stunning cinematography, made crisper by present-day technology, and the film's overall visual concept continue to make your jaw drop with admiration."
1,"Building on earlier science fiction and endlessly influential on later works, Lang's film is a mammoth marvel, fusing modernism and expressionism, art deco and Biblical spectacle, Wagnerian bombast, sentimental Marxism and religiose millenarianism."
1,You've seen the rest; now see the best.
1,The great Fritz Lang created this chilling 1926 evocation of a mechanized utopia run by underground slave labor.
1,"The film looks fabulous, and Gottfried Huppertz's original score is another worthy addition."
1,"Lang's impossibly vast skyscraper-ziggurats (inspired, it's said, by his first view of the Manhattan skyline) are the blueprint for nearly every science-fiction movie city of the past 30 years."
1,The extended version -- the additional footage is easy to spot because it's rather worn and a slightly different size -- provides more of the extraordinary performance by the teenage Helm.
1,"To see the film as the director intended, on the big screen with an original score recorded by a 60-piece orchestra, greatly enhances the reputation of a film already considered one of the icons of the silent era."
1,Here's a coincidence: The first must-see movie of 2010 is also the must-see movie of 1927. The difference is that you can actually see it now. Or most of it.
1,There's no denying either the influence of Lang's vision -- so much of what he did in this film lives on that we take it as cultural assumption -- or the still valid energy of his storytelling.
1,"This movie is certifiably nuts and naive in many ways, but it is so exciting."
0,Too bad that so much really artistic work was wasted on this manufactured story.
1,"A fully realized work of art whose influence on science fiction, set design and symbolism can scarcely be put into words."
1,"I have just had a sensational night at the movies, and the picture was only 83 years old."
1,An eternal masterpiece.
1,"One of the last examples of the imaginative -- but often monstrous -- grandeur of the Golden Period of the German film, Metropolis is a spectacular example of Expressionist design."
1,Occasionally it strikes one that [Lang] wanted to include too much and then that all one anticipates does not appear. But at the same time the various ideas have been spliced together quite adroitly.
1,Each frame of this classic is drop-dead stunning.
1,Here is the starting-point of so much modern cinema.
1,For years audiences have wondered how good this film might have been had it not been edited. It turns out that it's better than anyone could ever have expected.
1,"Often enough it is exciting in a broad, elemental way, just as an earthquake or a loud clap of thunder would be exciting; but when individual characters come on to the screen they rouse little Interest for their own sakes."
0,"It gives in one eddying concentration almost every possible foolishness, clich챕, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general, served up with a sauce of sentimentality that is all its own."
1,"The film has, in consequence, a remarkable pictorial power, and, in spite of its occasional solemnities, is one which will well repay study by those who are interested in the development of a separate cinematographic technique."
1,It's fascinating corn.
1,"Anne Bancroft is superb as Annie Sullivan, the teacher who finally reached into Helen Keller's darkness, and Patty Duke is chillingly real as the young Helen."
1,"It's a stunningly impressive piece of work, typically (for Penn) deriving much of its power from the performances."
1,"Where the picture really excels, outside of its inherent story values, is in the realm of photographic technique."
1,"The centerpiece is a one-room, nine-minute war of attrition, as a tutor (Anne Bancroft) imposes table manners on her feral charge (Patty Duke). It's a heaving, shin-cracking donnybrook, done with complete commitment."
0,"Director Joseph Zito tips his hand; he simply doesn't know how to build suspense, and no amount of cello-sawing and cross-cutting can change that."
0,"There isn't a moment in The Mission that is not watchable, but the moments don't add up to a coherent narrative."
1,"""The Mission"" effectively dramatizes yet another chapter in the ruthless European conquest of the Americas. It'll make you hate the whole of western civilization with every fiber of your being."
0,"""The Mission"" is everything a movie should be -- magnificently produced, epic in scope, serious in theme -- everything, that is, but good."
0,A singularly lumpy sort of movie.
0,"The Mission manages to be both magnificent and curiously uninvolving, a buddy movie played in soutanes."
0,"The two principal actors, Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons, work hard to animate their parts. But there is little to do. The Mission is probably the first film in which De Niro gives a bland, uninteresting performance."
1,
1,A strikingly superior entertainment.
1,The acting is the only reason to watch it.
1,James Cagney is simply great as the captain of the ship.
1,"Henry Fonda stars, as brilliant as ever."
1,A rolling and thundering color film that is herewith devoutly recommended as one of the great motion pictures of our times.
1,It is often staggeringly good.
0,"Moby Dick is interesting more often than exciting, faithful to the time and text more than great theatrical entertainment."
1,"One could have plenty of quarrels with this as an adaptation of the Herman Melville novel, but it's still one of the better John Huston films of the 50s."
1,Moby Dick is certainly the most unusual picture of the year and may well be the best.
1,"he timing of the gags can put most Hollywood comedies, never mind TV sitcoms, to shame."
0,"As soon as this gag is established and provokes the obvious guffaws, the subsequent changes rung upon it become just a little dull."
0,"Attempt to draw out a thin, familiar slapstick idea isn't carried off."
1,Monkey Business ranks with the best works of the American cinema.
1,A summit of comic invention.
1,"While parts of Moonraker are rather silly, solid special effects, well-executed action sequences, and a strict reliance upon the 'Bond Formula' keep this film among Moore's better entries as the British superspy."
0,"Frivolous, yes, but never dull."
1,It's one of the most buoyant Bond films of all.
1,"Moonraker is a movie by gadgeteers, for gadgeteers, about gadgeteers. Our age may be losing its faith in technology, but James Bond sure hasn't."
1,"The space-age plot is spread dangerously thin, the fights all tend to slapstick, and the wanton destruction has become rather too predictable. But it's held together by likeable performances."
1,Christopher Wood's script takes the characters exactly where they always go in a James Bond pic and the only question is whether the stunts and gadgets will live up to expectations. They do.
1,"Broccoli just keeps piling on the goodies: lush Ken Adam sets, gadgetry and gams galore, super stunts and effects."
1,"Lewis Gilbert directed, but the real auteur of the series is production designer Ken Adam, whose spectacular chrome and plastic sets define Bond's world and technological ethic."
1,"Moonraker, the newest James Bond spectacle, is a cheerful, splashy entertainment. The curators of the Bond museum do not surpass themselves with this exhibition, the 11th in the series, but they haven't fallen down on the job either."
1,"Moulin Rouge stands out as a truly artistic production flawlessly directed by John Huston and presenting superb performances by Ferrer, Colette Marchand and Suzanne Flon, and Technicolor photography of a beauty rarely achieved on the screen."
1,Many 'minor' Hitchcocks turn out to be intriguing films once you forgive them for not being thrillers.
1,A gentle crazy comedy.
0,The result is a chucklesome comedy that fails to mount into a coruscating wave of laughter.
1,Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are teamed successfully here in a light and gay marital farce.
1,"It may be disappointing to many of the followers of Norman Krasna, Alfred Hitchcock and Carole Lombard who expected extreme brilliance from that trio, but there's enough fun in it to send you home happy with your entertainment."
0,"a very strange and maddening movie, being a fascinating tale that's nowhere as provocative as it first promises to be and as the reputations of everyone connected with it might lead you to expect."
0,"didn't for one moment convince me that these were real people, acting from the bottom of their hearts."
1,"handsomely mounted period piece, but can't shake off a certain air of good manners"
0,"In ""Mrs. Soffel,"" director Gillian Armstrong is so enthralled with her feminist message that she never lets her story breathe."
1,A sombre and atmospheric depiction of eternal passion and occult reincarnation.
0,The photography is superior to the dialogue.
1,"The drama may be clumsy, but Freund's lighting is a wonder."
1,The transformation of Karloff's Im-Ho-Tep from a clay-like figure in a coffin to a living thing is the highlight.
0,Thoroughly unreasonable hocus-pocus.
0,"One looks forward with vivid expectation to seeing how the centuries-dead creature will react to the sights and sounds of the present day. But the further the story goes, the more thoroughly it lapses into the worn-out hocus-pocus of melodrama."
1,"An eerie, weirdly moving film about loneliness and the persistence of history."
1,"An intelligent, well-acted and thoroughly entertaining motion picture in the routine pattern of mystery thrillers."
1,Perhaps the most provocative of all early British Hitchcocks.
1,"Well photographed and mounted, it contains all the gadgets of the pet Alfred Hitchcock technique, from quick cutting to skillful dialog blending."
1,"It remains a crucial insight into the development of one of the cinema's greatest artists, and so, essential viewing."
1,A rousing adventure film set on the high seas.
1,It is superlatively thrilling.
1,"An exotic and gripping piece of Hollywood mythology, made with all the technical skill and gloss one associates with Irving Thalberg's MGM."
1,"It's tainted by a fair amount of middlebrow stuffiness, but it's a fleet piece of storytelling and serves to enshrine one of the great ham performances of all time, Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh."
1,"The story is spellbinding, the acting lusty and the spectacle everything you could expect from a Golden Age MGM production -- though sometimes it's a bit too much on the monumental side."
1,There's nothing to stand in the way of Mutiny qualifying for box office dynamite rating.
0,"Despite the efforts of Producer Irving Thalberg, Director Frank Lloyd, three scenarists and $2,000,000 to give it balance, polish and direction, the picture lacks all three."
1,The case of the crew against the insane cruelty and avariciousness of Capt. Bligh is so powerfully presented that the injustice done to the men gets under one's skin to stir up a variety of emotion.
1,"The visual quality in the scenes of shipboard life -- the billowing sails, the surge of the rollers, the mighty impetus of the vessel's swing -- has in it a tremendous and Infectious verve."
0,Hardly anyone was pleased with the results.
0,...Marlon Brando makes Fletcher Christian an eccentric who dominates the entire dramatic scheme.
0,"Brando makes a total mess of his English accent, the romantic interlude in Tahiti goes on endlessly, and the visuals (perhaps the main point of interest in the movie) too often resort to travelogue vistas and picture postcard lighting."
1,There may be a sober moment or two in the picture; there may be a few lines of the script that do not pack a laugh. Somehow we cannot remember them.
1,"The film has lost some of its allure over the years, but it's still streets and streets ahead of the addled whimsy favoured by latter-day Hollywood."
1,William Powell and Carole Lombard are pleasantly teamed in this splendidly produced comedy.
1,[A] screwball masterpiece.
1,"God, but this film is beautiful."
1,"Gregory La Cava's improvisational style received its highest critical acclaim for this 1936 film, a marginally Marxist exercise in class confusion during the Depression."
1,"My Man Godfrey emerges with that evasive quality that is not skillful playing, writing or direction, but something that mysteriously adds itself to these things, and makes a tip-top picture."
1,"Bigelow has cross-bred vampire legends, westerns and biker movies to arrive at a combination that's both outrageous and poetic; it has extravagant, bloody thrills + something else -- something that comes close to genuine emotion."
0,You might call this the scattershot school of film making.
1,A subtle study in the seductiveness of evil and a terrifying ride to the edge of darkness.
1,Bigelow's artful handling of the magic and menace of the night is hauntingly apparent.
1,"This is on the whole a striking directorial debut, at once scary and erotic, with lots of sidelong touches in the casting, direction, and script."
1,"High-powered but pared down, slick but spare, this is a tale that introduces the unearthly into the banality of rural American existence."
1,"Near Dark has filmmaking finesse to spare, but puts its dank characters on display rather than cadging sympathy for them. It is the Blue Velvet of date-night spook shows."
1,"Long after the picture ends, you're left with potent half-images: strong-but-vague impressions that resemble the remains of dreams."
1,"There's a ghastly humor in all this, and Bigelow brings it out without overindulging it. Faced with a nearly repulsive subject, she makes the blood flow inside it, stream out over the cuts."
1,"Neighbors is a truly interesting comedy, an offbeat experiment in hallucinatory black humor. It grows on you."
1,"When James Goldman's script hits one of its frequent dead spots, Schaffner's camera is there to take up most of the slack with elegantly designed wide-screen compositions."
0,"The problem with Nicholas and Alexandra is that it considers the Russian Revolution from, in some ways, the least interesting perspective."
1,"Stodgy, but intermittently absorbing."
0,"One can be more or less hypnotized by the spectacle of their downfall, but it's difficult to be really moved by it."
0,"Old-fashioned, overlong costume epic."
1,"Sam Spiegel comes up with a rarity: the intimate epic, in telling the fascinating story of the downfall of the Romanovs."
1,Guaranteed to have you giggling from one end of the musical scale to the other.
1,"It is impossible to explain why that is so funny; their sheer irreverence, exuberance and verbal comic genius are marvelous."
1,The Brothers get to perform some of their most irresistible routines.
1,The loudest and funniest screen comedy of the Winter season.
1,"The backstage finish, with Harpo doing a Tarzan on the fly ropes, contains more action than the Marxes usually go in for, but it relieves the strictly verbal comedy and provides a sock exit."
0,Never was a director more aptly named than Sam Wood: his movies are redwood forests of unrelieved monotony.
1,"There is a resounding lack of sentimentality that cuts through the death and chaos, as a desperate bunch of people fight to stay alive."
0,"The dialogue and background music sound hollow, as if they had been recorded in an empty swimming pool, and the wobbly camera seems to have a fetishist's interest in hands."
1,"Chuckle, if you can, during the first few minutes; because after that laughter catches in the throat as the clammy hand of terror tightens its grip."
1,"George Romero's remarkably assured debut, made on a shoestring, about a group of people barricaded inside a farmhouse while an army of flesh-eating zombies roams the countryside, deflates all genre clichs."
1,"Over its short, furious course, the picture violates so many strong taboos -- cannibalism, incest, necrophilia -- that it leaves audiences giddy and hysterical."
1,I felt real terror in that neighborhood theater last Saturday afternoon. I saw kids who had no resources they could draw upon to protect themselves from the dread and fear they felt.
1,Although pic's basic premise is repellent -- recently dead bodies are resurrected and begin killing human beings in order to eat their flesh -- it is in execution that the film distastefully excels.
1,"If [Romero's] original vision of the undead looks dulled by today's standards, his embedded political commentary on racism feels just as sharp."
1,"The immediate, quasi-documentary feel, a result of budgetary constraints, actually served the film's horror, jolting audiences because it all seemed just a little too real."
1,"Romero conjures moments of eeriness and dread throughout, keeping the lighting low and the special effects to a minimum, though there will be blood, fire, cannibalism and a great deal of death."
1,Baker cuts to the chase - the iceberg strikes 30 minutes in - and maintains tension with consummate skill: not an easy task when the outcome is already known.
1,Cold and brutal - exactly how this tale should be told.
1,"A restrained, nearly austere ensemble drama that manages to intertwine a dozen different stories without tripping up on any of them, it relies on real-life survivor testimony for almost every line and incident, to immensely moving and dignified effect."
1,"[A Night to Remember] is a motion picture that will long be remembered for the manner in which it has dramatized cold fact, and given the suspense and the excitement usually engendered only by fiction."
1,"All of it is standard stuff, and yet Nighthawks has been assembled with enough pep to make it feel fresh."
0,"A terrorist hijacking a cable car, even in New York, is a mildly ludicrous idea -- were no 747s handy? The plot of Nighthawks makes no sense."
1,"Though there's never much doubt how the duel will end, the climax is nonetheless surprising and totally satisfying, topping the energy of the previous pursuit."
0,"Nighthawks, an aggressively shallow police thriller pitting New York undercover cops against international terrorists."
1,This is a movie about how money and excitement generate a seduction that can change personal values; it's better and deeper than you might expect.
0,"Count me among those who would be happy never to see another starring role for Gere, except maybe as Felix in a remake of The Odd Couple."
0,A standard-issue cop thriller that amounts to Beverly Hills Cop in a bad mood.
0,Pearce pads out his plot with lots of borrowed bits ... but the borrowings don't have any resonance of their own: they simply hang on the story like empty thematic husks.
1,"An above-average film noir, and its creepy feeling for the back streets of New Orleans and the sultry evil of its red-light suburbs got under my skin."
1,"A passionate film noir that depends heavily upon Mr. Gere to give it credence, and Mr. Gere delivers."
1,The film makes such good use of Washington and builds suspense so well that it transcends a plot bordering on ridiculous.
1,In thriller terms it's close to irresistible and enormously entertaining.
1,"A superior example of the genre, a film in which a simple situation grows more and more complex until it turns into a nightmare not only for the hero but also for everyone associated with him."
1,"It's so effective, in fact, that when it's all over, you might want to sit through the beginning again just to see if the end is justified by the means. I suspect that it is."
1,"A very convincing nightmare, and if Hackman gives too rounded a performance to approach the omniscient evil of Laughton's original, Patton assumes the mantle as Brice's henchman, while Costner confirms his arrival as a star."
1,No Way Out is an effective updating and revamping of the 1948 film noir classic The Big Clock.
1,"It's the kind of intricately plotted suspense film with juicy secondary parts (Will Patton, George Dzundza, Iman, Howard Duff) that used to be churned out in the 1940s."
0,"Viewers who arrive at the movie five minutes late and leave five minutes early will avoid the setup and payoff for the preposterous twist that spoils this lively, intelligent remake of 1948's The Big Clock."
0,"While the film's behind-the-scenes look into the world of Washington bureaucracy is appealing, the movie is a complete letdown as a thriller, dissolving into implausible silliness."
1,"No Way Out emerges, paradoxically, as a film that is better than it has to be and not as good as it ought to be, but there is skill here, as well as an admirable willingness to try something new."
1,"No Way Out's greatest prize is Costner, a leading man at last: fiercely good, intelligent, appreciatively sensual in a performance balanced perfectly between action and introspection."
1,"A thriller that grabs you even before the ironies of its plot kick in is a thriller you don't want to miss. No Way Out is that sort of movie, a thriller that's thrilling throughout."
1,A juicy thriller-romance bursting out of the Pentagon's arid corridors.
1,"Sometimes overwrought excess can be its own reward. If Obsession had been even a little more subtle, had made even a little more sense on some boring logical plane, it wouldn't have worked at all."
1,"Subtlety is a not a term that can often be applied to DePalma's work, but it's this uncharacteristic restraint that helps make ""Obsession"" his masterpiece."
0,"Whatever shred of credibility the movie retains is dispersed by the final, dead serious directorial hocus?릔ocus."
0,"De Palma's direction has its splashy slickness, but the people serve as mere props for the effects."
1,It does well as an evening's entertainment.
1,An irresistible double act from Lemmon and Matthau.
1,"For all its overfamiliarity, this is a good play, easily Simon's best, and Matthau and Lemmon inhabit it with grace and style."
1,"...a durable classic, the sort of comedy that doesn't try to yank laughs by cramming its fist down our throats."
1,The Neil Simon comedy that lit up Broadway for more than two years shines again in this flawed but still funny screen adaptation.
1,"Capitalizing on almost every funny line in the play, and keeping physical setups to a wise minimum, playwright-screenwriter Neil Simon and director Gene Saks have adapted to the screen, fidelity-sharp, the embattled hilarity of The Odd Couple."
1,"Odd Man Out is a picture to see, to absorb in the darkness of the theatre and then go home and talk about."
1,Carol Reed's first great postwar film.
1,Fascinating but imperfect.
1,"Reed's take on the material is innovative, letting realism blur into an anaemic, soul-searching delirium. Camera trickery is used to mind-bending effect and Odd Man Out's hallucinatory tone is often astonishing."
1,"This may be Reed's most pretentious film, but it also happens to be one of his very best, beautifully capturing the poetry of a city at night."
1,"Carol Reed has made his film with deliberation and care, and has achieved splendid teamwork from every member of the cast. Occasionally too intent on pointing his moral and adorning his tale, he has missed little in its telling."
1,
1,"Dostoevskian in conception and design, the story progressively becomes more wildly adventurous, more mystical, more half-baked. But even in its failures, Odd Man Out is admirable."
0,The surprises increasingly fail to surprise.
0,"The film makes its points methodically, almost academically."
0,"Voight's performance gives credibility to his character's obsession, but even that cannot overcome the discrepancy between the deeper themes and the routine nature of this piece of box-office action adventure."
0,"As long as movies like The Omen are merely scaring us, they're fun in a portentous sort of way."
1,"A member of the Exorcist family, it is a dreadfully silly film, which is not to say that it is totally bad."
1,
1,"This apocalyptic movie mostly avoids physical gore to boost its relatively unoriginal storyline with suspense, some excellent acting (especially from Warner and Whitelaw), and a very deft, incident-packed script."
1,Richard Donner's direction is taut. Players all are strong.
1,"Richard Donner directs more for speed than mood, but there are a few good shocks."
1,The Omen contains some of the most memorable untimely deaths in cinema history.
1,"The great merit of this picture, aside from its entertaining qualities, is the fact that it carries a passionate conviction that man is worth saving, after all."
0,"Fine photography, but the script is a typically numbing affair, and the cast, aside from Peck and Meillon, seem totally out of their depth."
0,"A tiresome, talky 1959 film."
1,"Gaiety, rhythm, humor and a good, wholesome dash of light romance have been artfully blended together in this bright Technicolored comedy."
1,"On the Town is exhilarating, brash spectacle, all rip-snorting, wisecracking attack, and maybe just a teensy bit unlikeable."
1,"The pep, enthusiasm and apparent fun the makers of On the Town had in putting it together comes through to the audience and gives the picture its best asset."
1,"A fine, freewheeling musical."
1,A bright Christmas confection.
0,
0,"Because Simon is dealing with a place -- and a commonplace -- rather than people, it is only too easy to see the jokes coming long before they arrive."
1,It is the closest the sound film has come to recapturing the genius of the silent movie chase comedy.
1,"Surprisingly, the film is delightful-mostly because of 15-year-old Hayley Mills, the blonde button nose who played the endearing delinquent in Tiger Bay."
1,"Edwards directs with economy for most of the way, but when the living room fills up with soapsuds and the elephant, he can't help lingering over the expensive scene he's produced."
1,"he point is made endlessly, though it's in the film's favor that it's made with seriousness, consideration, and a certain amount of imagination."
0,"The movie, though, is not easy to respond to. It's chilly without being provocative in any intellectual way."
0,Pennies from Heaven is dazzling and disappointing in equal measure.
1,"Let's face the music and dance, indeed."
0,"Almost as if he were directing Pinter, Herbert Ross has actors speak a line, then wait two beats before delivering the next phrase. Technique smothers such ordinarily lively performers as Martin, Peters and Harper."
0,Perhaps this was not the project on which to lavish so many MGM millions. The BBC show was an enchanted cottage; this is the Las Vegas Grand Hotel.
1,Literal-minded moviegoers will find it easy to hate Pennies from Heaven. But those willing to go along with the device will find the film a source of constant surprise and delight.
0,Disney's depersonalizing habit of putting different teams in charge of different sections of the story really shows up here.
1,"Ornamented with some bright and lilting tunes, it is a lively feature-length Technicolor excursion into a world that glows with an exhilarating charm and a gentle joyousness."
1,A feature cartoon of enchanting quality.
1,A delightful entertaining film that will appeal to the young and the not-so young alike.
1,"In the 36 years of its existence, the movie has aged as little as Peter himself. It is still a lush, bright feature that happily clicks along with rollicking songs by Sammy Cahn, Sammy Fain and others."
1,It is doubtful if the wistful fantasy has ever been done with such charm and beauty as fills the Walt Disney version of James M. Barrie's fanciful play.
1,"It has two elements of genius: It creates beneath the opera one of the most grotesque places in the cinema, and Chaney's performance transforms an absurd character into a haunting one."
1,"The Phantom of the Opera is an ultra fantastic melodrama, an ambitious production in which there is much to marvel at in the scenic effects."
1,The highs are way up there with the best in the tradition of Gothic fantasy.
0,Rupert Julian's 1925 silent film doesn't have much going for it apart from the famous unmasking scene.
1,A pinnacle of the Hollywood fantastic.
1,"The main inducement to watch remains Chaney's tragic, ineffably sad figure."
0,"Kerry is a colorless hero, Philbin contents herself with being pretty and becoming terrorized at the Phantom, and Chaney is either behind a mask or grimacing through his fiendish makeup."
0,"Though Mr. Chaney wears a more grotesque make-up than ever, the film play seems only pretty good."
1,"A grand, pulpy potboiler of a suspense melodrama."
1,"The atmosphere matches Chaney's performance perfectly. His grotesque appearance is achieved with wires, cotton balls, and eye-dilating chemicals, but his character, as usual, is animated from within."
1,Lon Chaney's performance as the hideous organist prowling the sewers beneath the Paris Opera is still a cornerstone of gothic horror.
1,
1,"Alexander Fisher's sound is good. Fernando Carrere's art direction and set decoration by Reginald Allen, Jack Stevens and Arrigo Breschi provide visual elegance to enhance the gags."
0,"There are too many attempts to single out particular performers when ensemble acting ought to prevail. That doesn't mean the leading players aren't appealing and accomplished, because they are."
1,"Gilbert & Sullivan's durable The Pirates of Penzance has been turned into an elaborate screen musical by basically the same hands responsible for Joseph Papp's smash New York Shakespeare Festival and Broadway stage production, and result is a delight."
1,"The singing is full and rich, the casting inspired."
1,"The result is a physically stylish, imaginatively photographed horror film which, though needlessly corny in many spots, adds up to good exploitation."
1,Roger Corman has evoked a genuinely chilling mood of horror.
1,A magnificently indignant Heston ... wrestles with the imponderables of a topsy-turvy world in which apes reign over humankind.
0,"A dreadful film, a compendium of clumsy dialogue, one-dimensional characters, risible plot turns and long silences broken by incomprehensible meaningful looks."
1,"Planet of the Apes is one of those rare films whose historical impact outweighs its quality. It's a good film, but not a classic."
0,Dismal SF deep think (1968) that gave birth to an equally dismal string of sequels and TV series spin-offs.
1,"It is quickly paced, completely entertaining, and its philosophical pretensions don't get in the way."
1,Planet of the Apes is an amazing film.
1,As illuminatingly bleak a statement on human hubris as a Hollywood superproduction has given us.
1,"It's a film to see, all right, and it does confirm Schaffner's talent. It is only that one can now see more clearly the limits of that talent, limits which are much narrower than I had hoped."
0,"It is no good at all, but fun, at moments, to watch."
1,"By its appeal to both the imagination and the intellect within a context of action and elemental adventure, in its relevance to the consuming issues of its time...Planet of the Apes is that rare film which will transcend all age and social groupings."
1,"The picture is an enormous many-layered black joke on the hero and the audience, and part of the joke is the use of Charlton Heston as the hero. I don't think the movie could have been so forceful or so funny with anyone else."
1,"It gets back into the groove of Hollywood thrillers, after the recent glut of spies, counterspies, funny spies, anti-hero spies and spy-spier spies."
1,"There are moments of breathtaking visual creativity, from the not-quite-freeze-frames over the opening credits to a series of confrontational close-ups when things turn violent."
1,"An intriguing, disorientating 60s artefact."
1,A movie to saviour again and again on the biggest screen you can get to.
1,"Has aged as well as Lee Marvin's brown jacket and tangerine shirt ensemble - that is to say, spectacularly."
1,"An almost experimental discourse on crime, punishment and revenge brilliantly shot by Philip H. Lathrop."
1,"Hayley Mills' work more than compensates for the film's lack of tautness and, at certain points, what seems to be an uncertain sense of direction."
1,Pollyanna emerges on the wide screen as the best live-actor movie Disney has ever made: a Niagara of drivel and a masterpiece of smarm.
0,"This is a film that tends to annoy, as if it had been more taut and consistent, it could have been far more exciting."
1,"Poltergeist is like a thoroughly enjoyable nightmare, one that you know that you can always wake up from, and one in which, at the end, no one has permanently been damaged. It's also witty in a fashion that Alfred Hitchcock might have appreciated."
1,"Hooper and Spielberg hold our interest by observing the everyday rituals of this family so closely that, since the family seems real, the weird events take on a certain credibility by association."
1,It is consistently redeemed by its creator's dazzling sense of craft.
0,"Given the talents, Poltergeist is an annoying film because it could have been so much better."
1,"Though the shocks are well conveyed, it's the sweetness that lingers, making this the first cute and cuddly entry in the genre."
1,The film delivers honest special-effects shocks without forfeiting its good nature.
1,"[It] raises interesting psychological issues in the context of a baroque ghost story. It's a devastating commentary on the tv-oriented suburban lifestyle. Finally, it demonstrates the power and efficacy of the story told from the child's point of view."
1,"A thoroughly charming, immensely appealing mess of a movie, often high-spirited and witty, occasionally pretentious and flat, sometimes robustly funny and frequently unintelligible."
1,He takes one of the most artificial and limiting of art forms -- the comic strip -- and raises it to the level of high comedy and high spirits.
1,"You wonder how on earth Altman did it; equally often, you feel you are watching a wacky masterpiece, the like of which you've never seen before."
0,"The plotting of this 1980 feature -- outsider in a hostile environment -- is personal to Altman, though few of the feelings survive the clutter."
0,"It is more than faint praise to say that Popeye is far, far better than it might have been, considering the treacherous challenge it presented. But avoiding disaster is not necessarily the same as success."
0,"The Poseidon Adventure is the kind of movie you know is going to be awful, and yet somehow you gotta see it, right?"
1,"Development of the characters makes Tay Garnett's direction seem slowly paced during first part of the picture, but this establishment was necessary to give the speed and punch to the uncompromising evil that transpires."
0,The Postman Always Rings Twice is an absolutely superb mounting of a hollow and disappointing production.
1,"There is little of the gratuitous hysteria that usually mars Lumet's work, and David Himmelstein's busy script keeps things moving, though at the price of losing track of a couple of significant subplots."
0,"The movie seems to be asking us to walk out of the theater shaking our heads in disillusionment, but I was more puzzled than disillusioned."
0,"Before it turns slack and sentimental, ""Power,"" Sidney Lumet's foray into the world of political consultants, crackles with a kind of moral static."
1,"Typically overstuffed MGM prestige product (1940), but one that came out surprisingly well, with a minimum of Eng. Lit. posturing and some elegance of design."
1,"For pure charm and romantic diversion, for bubbling and wholesome life, we most heartily recommend this exquisite comedy about the elegant young gentleman who was proud and the beautiful young lady who was prejudiced."
1,This is one of the funniest movies ever made.
0,"The star not only indulges himself gluttonously, but the director seems to be doubled up with laughter at how funny he is being through Mostel; and the film bloats into sogginess."
1,"Brooks's magnum opus is still a ferocious gale of bulldozing Jewish mockery, dominated by Zero Mostel's comb-over juggernaut."
1,"This shamelessly low-brow, fearlessly satirical Brooks movie may just be Hollywood's ultimate satire, a furiously witty 'reductio ad absurdum' worthy of the great Augustans like Pope and Swift."
1,The film is ripe with treasures worth rediscovering.
1,"The one aspect of the original Producers that still stuns is the roaring, over-the-top, in-your-face thereness of its two lead performances."
1,Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.
1,"Brooks' first feature, an absolutely hilarious and tasteless New York Jewish comedy about Broadway."
1,"The Producers has many things going for it -- notably a wild, ad-lib energy that explodes in a series of sight gags and punch lines."
1,"Mel Brooks has turned a funny idea into a slapstick film, thanks to the performers, particularly Zero Mostel."
1,"Everything that can go wrong in an amateur film does go wrong, from the timing to the structure to the pitch of the performances."
1,Each time I've watched it - and I've watched it many times - Mel Brooks' The Producers has felt horribly pertinent to the present moment.
1,"It's as unabashedly political as ""Silkwood"" and unashamedly sentimental as ""Lassie Come Home."" Yet it remains taut and resists the temptation to paint the villains too broadly."
1,"It's content to be a well-made, intelligent entertainment aimed primarily, I imagine, at bright teenagers. It works on that level."
1,"Although Parkes and Lasker produce a set of primates guaranteed to charm the upholstery off the theater seats, there is little else."
0,"The director, Jonathan Kaplan, lays on the animal antics without stint; it's a one-ring circus. The way he tugs at our sympathy for the poor smart beasts may remind you of a house pet scratching away for attention."
1,Disney-ish drama with a conscience.
1,"Broderick is rightly more subdued here than in some recent performances, and supporting cast is discreetly effective."
0,"""Project X"" reflects quality and care throughout, but its elements don't quite mesh."
1,"Plenty of strikes against this--moronic story line, obligatory animal mugging, more ""awwwww"" opportunities than any film since 3 Men and a Cradle--but it's still one of the most accomplished pulp fantasies in a while."
1,"A combination of expose on Air Force experiments with chimpanzees and cuddly pet story, Project X should fly high as family entertainment."
0,"Because it's quite easy to figure out the killer's identity by simply keeping track of who is off screen a lot, much of the movie is just vamping for time."
0,Why do people go to these movies?
1,"If you forget motivation, the visual trick-or-treat of slow revenge is entertaining enough."
0,"Director Paul Lynch seems to capture the spirit of the genre here, but spends a little too much time setting up each murder, thus eliminating some suspense."
1,A quietly absorbing if finally somewhat dubious drama about an unlikely anti-corporate crusader.
1,"Promised Land presents its environmental concerns in a clear, upfront manner but hits some narrative and character bumps in the second half that weaken the impact of this fundamentally gentle, sympathetic work."
0,"Can't help but preach its cause in obvious ways that continually hold back an otherwise well-acted, swiftly paced drama."
1,"...This is no vanity project, but a real, solid and legitimate piece of filmmaking."
1,Whatever ambiguity the movie's core lacks is rebalanced at the surface; its organic textures are woven on a conspicuously synthetic frame.
0,The movie slogs along like a Grant Wood farmer behind his plow.
1,"Though the film eventually caves to sentiment and stereotype, its alert performances and muted rhythms offer much to enjoy in the interim."
0,"While there's no faulting the talent or good intentions of the people involved, however, they make the mistake of leaving out the spoonful of sugar, which makes the medicine get stuck in your throat. It's all message and very little movie."
0,"Promised Land is a hard-sell movie because it doesn't have the confidence in its audience to make any other outcome seem personally viable, to give the opposition a fighting chance or persuasive voice."
0,"When you add in the plot contrivances that cluster around its finale, ""Promised Land"" concludes as an echo of a convincing film rather than the real deal."
1,"While there's little doubt about where ""Promised Land"" is going (you don't think a Gus Van Sant movie is going to side with a corporation, do you?), it's a pleasure to watch it go there."
0,"Promised Land is a frustrating film to watch. It should be better than this, smarter than this."
1,"It's a fine line between interesting characters and ""Northern Exposure"" quirk, but the movie mostly stays on the right side of it."
0,"""Promised Land"" feels divided against itself, not quite sure how to reconcile its polemical intentions with its storytelling impulses, and thus finally unable to fulfill its own promise."
0,"The script is unconvincing; two key narrative twists, one related to the other, are deeply hokey."
0,"The kind of earnest, oversimplified big-issues drama that Hollywood loves to foist on audiences as seasonal proof of its serious-mindedness."
1,"There's a lightness of touch here that makes its level-headed advocacy go down smooth as lager, and allows some quiet room for thought."
1,Promised Land is a potent and powerful look at how the stressed economy is stressing farm communities across America. Director Gus Van Sant finds the human side of a knotty issue.
0,No one seems to recognize the irony of making a film about corporate rigging that is itself outrageously rigged.
0,"The movie threatens to become one of those late '60s/early '70s heavy-handed message movies, but it's somewhat salvaged by Damon's innate likability and the chemistry among the cast."
0,"It's as if the people behind Promised Land only agreed to make the movie if there was an unambiguous ""policy statement"" at the end, and that's what we're subjected to."
1,"""Promised Land"" is a fine place to start appreciating Matt Damon, who always makes it seem as if everybody else is acting and he's just going through the movie being natural."
0,"Matt Damon's new film ""Promised Land"" starts off on the right foot - and then shoots itself in it."
0,"Damon wants to put you in Very Serious mode and have you think of ""issue movies"" like ""The China Syndrome,"" but all I could do was laugh and think of ""Lolita."""
0,"Despite their Everyman appeal, Damon and Krasinski don't create much by way of emotional investment, instead becoming mirror images of their most mild-mannered, white-bread selves."
0,"""Promised Land"" offers an experience that's alternately amusing and frustrating, full of impassioned earnestness as well as saggy sections."
1,"Damon and Krasinski co-wrote the script, and they do a nice job of giving the usual confrontations a gentle and surprising spin."
0,One of several ways this ... picture falls short is in trying to sell a personal-salvation story as a salve to the conundrum it presents.
1,Damon's performance as corporate salesman Steve Butler is one of his best.
0,"A well-intentioned look at a fraught issue, but the Damon-Krasinski screenplay ultimately opts for Hollywood oversimplification."
0,"A love triangle involving the two men and a local schoolteacher (Rosemarie DeWitt) seems more like a commercial necessity than an integral part of the story, and the small-town types are indifferently realized by director Gus Van Sant."
1,This is a solid if at times too conventional tale of a classic moral conflict.
1,[It's mostly] a well-wrought drama that feels genuine as it goes about spinning a tale worthy of our challenging times.
1,Promised Land is more effective as an anti-fracking screed than as a drama.
1,"Damon and McDormand are terrific as co-workers seeking the same goal, though they see their work from different points of view."
1,"This isn't a movie about easy fixes, be they personal or political; it's a film about long-term problems."
0,Far too awkward and contrived a drama to change many hearts and minds.
1,"The 50/50 split between profiteers and tree-huggers might reflect the nation as a whole, but it makes for diluted drama."
1,Gus Van Sant's fracking drama pits Matt Damon's energy executive against John Krasinski's eco-dreamboat in a battle for the minds of backwater farmers and the heart of Rosemarie DeWitt's moony schoolma'am.
0,"Van Sant is no Frank Capra, so why is he trying so hard to be?"
0,"Not confident or bolshy enough about the subject, too aware of eco versus economic pros and cons ..."
0,"A gentle rather than dramatic film that, once the central argument is laid out, lacks real flair."
1,"James Cagney's portrayal of a bootlegging runt is truly electrifying (he'd made five films, but this one made him a star), and Jean Harlow makes the tartiest tart imaginable."
1,"Cagney's energy and Wellman's gutsy direction carry the day, counteracting the moralistic sentimentality of the script and indelibly etching the star on the memory as a definitive gangster hero."
1,There's no lace on this picture. It's raw and brutal. It's low-brow material given such workmanship as to make it high-brow.
1,"If there are to be gangster pictures, let them be like The Public Enemy, hard-boiled and vindictive almost to the point of burlesque."

1,"MGM's opulent version of ancient Rome circa 1951, with Peter Ustinov at his most whimsical doing honors as the mad Nero."
0,"It was made, we suspect, for those who like grandeur and noise -- and no punctuation. It will probably be a vast success."
1,"It does last virtually three hours, and along the way does have stretches of tedium, but LeRoy invests most of it with pace, true spectacle, and not a little imagination."
1,"For sheer size, opulence and technical razzle-dazzle, Quo Vadis is the year's most impressive cinematic sight-seeing spree."
1,Quo Vadis is a super-spectacle in all its meaning.
1,Quo Vadls is the most spectacular film since the days of Ben Hur and Intolerance. But as an epic it does not have the corn of De Mille -- nor the excitement.
1,It does have enough gritty insights and (for the time) strikingly accurate production details to keep the level of interest up.
0,This plot is so simple that perhaps the most amazing achievement of Raw Deal is its ability to screw it up. This movie didn't just happen to be a mess; the filmmakers had to work to make it so confusing.
0,"The Razor's Edge is far from being a bad movie. Some of the scenes are very good, especially the uncle's deathbed farewell and Murray's first attempts to sober up Russell. But at the end I didn't feel engaged."
0,"An adaptation of the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, this longtime pet project of Murray's will only disappoint his many fans."
1,"Although it's an intensely intimate film, there's something special about taking your seat in the theater as though you're pulling up right next to L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart)."
1,Masterpiece!
1,Hitchcock combines technical and artistic skills in a manner that makes this an unusually good piece of murder mystery entertainment.
1,One of the master's greatest stunts.
1,Rear Window is the epitome of Hollywood class.
1,"Since the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic is all about the voyeuristic instinct, the better the view, the more sensational the experience."
1,Masterpiece of voyeurism.
1,Surely one of Alfred Hitchcock's best entertainments.
1,One of the finest ever committed to celluloid!
1,"In an impressive oeuvre, Rear Window is arguably the most exquisitely handcrafted feature, because Hitchcock mastered the spatial as well as behavioral coordinates of his chosen universe inch by inch."
1,The clearest example of a Hitchcock movie that functions on dual levels: It's both mousetrap and abyss.
1,"Rear Window lovingly invests in suspense all through the film, banking it in our memory, so that when the final payoff arrives, the whole film has been the thriller equivalent of foreplay."
1,"Its appeal, which goes beyond that of other, equally masterly Hitchcock works, remains undiminished."
1,"Don't resist the urge -- steal a peek at it now, and be reminded why Hitchcock is still without equal in the clammy thrills department."
1,The deliciousness of watching the film as it's intended to be seen is that the big screen gives Rear Window back its claustrophobia.
1,"Of all Hitchcock's films, this is the one which most reveals the man."
1,Just possibly the second most entertaining picture (after The 39 Steps) ever made by Alfred Hitchcock.
1,"It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's inspired audience-participation films: watching it, you feel titillated, horrified, and, ultimately, purged."
1,The boorish but fascinating pastime of peeking into other people's homes -- a thing that New York apartment dwellers have a slight disposition to do -- is used by Director Alfred Hitchcock to impel a tense and exciting exercise.
0,"Foley's feature debut treads the familiar turf of defiant teenagers, basically a compilation of contrivances and cliches lifted out The Wild One (Brando), Rebel Without Cause (James Dean), and most recently, All the Right Moves (Tom Cruise)."
0,"Youth on the run can be a whole lot of fun, but Reckless, by first-time filmmaker James Foley, is a particularly dreary affair."
0,"Contrived and cliched as it turns out to be, ''Reckless'' has enough vitality to carry it for a while, although it never stops recalling other films."
0,"It packs plenty of rabble-rousing ammunition, but its sloppy execution is unlikely to win any merit badges for marksmanship."
0,Right off the assembly line.
1,"""Red Heat"" is not the first movie about a couple of very different cops, and it will not be the last, but as the formula goes this is a superior example."
1,"If you still pine for the 80s where East vs West dominated action films, then this is an essential part of your education."
1,''Red Heat'' is a topically entertaining variation on the sort of action-adventure nonsense that plays best on television.
1,"Surface stuff, moderately contemptuous, but entertaining enough."
1,"Schwarzenegger, who when he dons a green suit is dubbed 'Gumby' by Belushi, is right on target with his characterization of the iron-willed soldier, and Belushi proves a quicksilver foil."
1,We must be contented with repeating that The Red Shoes is one you must see.
1,"The film is voluptuous in its beauty and passionate in its storytelling. You don't watch it, you bathe in it."
1,"A look beneath its lushly romantic surface reveals a dark, complex sensibility, and that surface, rendered in the somber tones of British Technicolor, reflects a fantastically rich cinematic inventiveness."
1,"The three principal dancers, Moira Shearer, Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann, are beyond criticism."
1,One of the most beautiful films ever made.
1,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's ode to the agony and the ecstasy of dancing is still joyous and moving even if you watch it through filthy, cracked sunglasses."
1,"What a cast, and what superbly florid but controlled direction. Unequalled Technicolor photography from Jack Cardiff. too."
1,"Blending impressionist art and expressionist film, blurring the barriers between theatre and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream, drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical."
0,"Truly spectacular, and yet dull."
1,"Profoundly serious, sublimely innocent, yet deeply and mysteriously erotic."
1,It has a quicksilver grace and variation of mood unlike anything else you've seen.
1,"No wonder Britain, still rationed in color, food, and feeling in the wake of an exhausting war, could not cope with what the movie proposed. Catch it here now, and you will not just be seeing an old film made new; you will have your vision restored."
1,The shoes have never been redder. The color of passion that drenches the Technicolor world of The Red Shoes has been restored to its original luster.
1,"The Red Shoes was shot in three-strip Technicolor, a process that's no longer used because of expense and technical complexity, but one that yielded some of the most spectacular images in cinema history."
1,"These faults, if faults they be, may well be outweighed by the beauty of the ballet sequences and music, by the skill with which Mr Powell always uses colour, and by Miss Shearer's endearing charm."
0,"A lingering, calf-eyed look at backstage ballet's little world of overworked egos and underdone glands."
1,The scene where Nielsen stands at the molten river border of the 'land of eternal night' looks particularly good.
0,"Mr. Fleischer brings absolutely no playfulness to what might, at least, have been enjoyably light. And he brings out the worst in a cast that was ill-chosen to begin with."
0,"Worst of all, there's a charmless brat prince for Sonja to take under her wing."
0,Red Sonja returns to those olden days when women were women and the menfolk stood around with funny hats on until called forth to be whacked at.
1,"The dialogue passages don't exactly play like Noel Coward, but this is a movie that succeeds rousingly well on its own humble, Saturday-night terms."
0,"None of this would matter if Red Sonja was the least bit exciting, or sexy, or even funny. Instead, it`s lumbering, oddly prim and laughable."
1,"[Repentance] is lit with bursts of satiric humor, with music, bits of opera and great flights of surreal imagery, which only serve to intensify its growing horror. And it is never less than physically gorgeous."
0,"Repentance would seem mordantly funny if its wit, like that of its central character, weren't also so cruel."
0,Its significance as a social and historical document far outstrips its value as art.
1,"Tengiz Abuladze's dreamlike allegorical fantasy about Stalinism, as well as despotism in general, is probably the best known and almost certainly one of the best Soviet films to have surfaced as a result of glasnost."
0,"The result is neither as minatory nor as moving as it thinks it is, despite some arresting surrealist images and the performance of Makharadze as Varlam."
0,"The work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care."
0,"Despite the presence of Billina the talking hen, the emphasis on insecurity and peril harks back to the treat-'em-rough days of children's fiction, and the disturbing/comforting ratio tilts conclusively towards the former."
1,"It's bleak, creepy, and occasionally terrifying."
0,Any movie in which a Midwestern prairie actually looks more attractive and more interesting than the enchanted land over the rainbow is in big trouble.
0,"Return to Oz is an astonishingly somber, melancholy and, sadly, unengaging trip back to a favorite land of almost every American's youth."
1,"""Return to Oz"" won't make anyone forget ""The Wizard of Oz,"" or even ""The Neverending Story,""... Then again, it's as good an excuse as any for treating the family to popcorn."
1,"The new characters may not have the human qualities the others had the souls and personalities. However, they are interesting enough and true to the tales spun by Baum in The Land of Oz (1904) and Ozma of Oz (1907)."
0,Return to Oz doesn't soar when it so clearly should.
0,"The basic problem with Return to Oz is its unrelieved oppressiveness, an atmosphere resulting mainly from our sense of Dorothy's constant plight."
0,Return to Oz is the kind of movie that encourages people to rent home videotapes of The Wizard of Oz and The Wiz.
0,"It combines the slick, high-tension filmmaking fashion of today with the values and sexual stereotyping of yesterday. It's such a good job of salesmanship that you have to stop and remind yourself you don't want any."
0,
0,"It contains scenes that make you want to squirm because of their awkwardness and awfulness, and yet you don't want to look away and you're not bored."
0,The shabby text undermines the valiant efforts of the hard-working costars and their stylish director to revive the pleasures of a vintage Hollywood women's picture.
1,[The film] improves as it goes along.
1,"It's funny because it deals with subjects that are so touchy, so fraught with emotional pain, that unless we laugh there's hardly any way we can deal with them -- especially if we are now, or ever were, a teenage boy."
1,"What distinguishes it, however, is that it's hovering permanently on the brink of stark, staring disaster in a way that strangely recalls The Graduate."
1,One of the finest film explorations of the end of innocence.
1,"Writer-director Paul Brickman can therefore be accused of trying to have it both ways, but there's no denying the stylishness and talent of his direction."
1,"For writer/director Paul Brickman, this was a case of being in the right place at the right time and, perhaps most importantly, getting the right leading man in place."
0,"Risky Business, a movie about a nice boy losing his virginity, is a first-time director's clear failure that I normally wouldn't get belligerent about, but the picture is so confused, so strange, and so openly corrupt that I can't resist."
0,"This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either."
0,"Road House lays out its story with the subtlety of a wrestling match, and probably with less sharpness or savvy."
0,The grotesque soon drowns out the giggles.
0,"Road House is much funnier than most comedies, until it turns vile instead of just stupid."
1,Mindless entertainment of the highest order.
0,"Its vigilante justice, lawlessness and wanton violence feel ludicrous in a modern setting."
0,Eventually it mutates into a paranoid revenge plot that might be called Walking Short.
0,"All Road House amounts to is a botched southern, and it's not worth a detour."
0,Road House is startling because of the intensity of its violence and because of Swayze's mindless posturing.
0,"What results instead is a monstrous hybrid-a grotesquely implausible, oversized character that thoroughly overshadows the poor actor himself."
1,"It's amazing how quickly an explosion, a ripped-out throat, or even four bangs in a row, can make other problems seem insignificant."
0,"But in deep ""Road House"" country... and the undefined made crassly visible, there isn't a whiff of romance anywhere, any more than there's a single jot of common sense."
1,"The visual style is charmingly conventional, as gently reassuring as that of a Donald Duck cartoon, sometimes as romantically pretty as an old Silly Symphony."
1,No one makes cultural appropriation as much fun as Walt Disney.
1,"Compared with modern Disney films, which are dominated by the self-absorption and eventual self-discovery of their main characters, Robin Hood offers surprisingly stark and interesting social questions."
0,"Even at its best, Robin Hood is only mildly diverting."
0,What sinks this one is the utter lack of the childhood insight and sympathy that really give the Disney films their staying power.
0,"The washed-out, muted colors are a mistake, and if Robin Hood is sometimes hilarious, it has little memorable magic."
1,Most thriller and special-effects movies come right off the assembly line...RoboCop is a thriller with a difference.
1,"...Verhoeven strives for bloodcurdling, darkly comic eloquence. He gives us heart with the hardware. Savagery with smarts."
1,...RoboCop is one weird and entertaining hybrid of camp and sci-fi shoot-'em-up.
1,"RoboCop is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted."
0,"Whatever may have been in the minds of the writers, Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, has more trouble emerging from Mr. Verhoeven's sizzling battles than poor Murphy does from his robosuit."
1,"Vile, violent, and very funny. The pace is breakneck, and when the wit does run out, way-out weaponry and whole-scale destruction keep the appalled excitement burning."
1,"There's a brooding, agonized quality to the violence that almost seems subversive, as if Verhoeven were both appalled and fascinated by his complicity in the toxic action rot."
1,A sci-fi action film with a silly title that turned out to be a biting satire of big business practices.
1,"Verhoeven's strong suits have always been visual energy and a Rabelaisan realism: a gutsy, jovial way of ripping through social systems."
0,"RoboCop relies for most of its impact -- and, more disturbingly, for much of its comedy -- on an absurd exaggeration of physical force."
1,"When the law-enforcing RoboCop cleans up corrupt Motown, his victory is satisfying because he's got machinery and morals on his side. RoboCop is where high-tech meets High Noon."
1,"Like the tormented figure at its center, this movie combines the mechanical with the human. And though much of the film is made up of spare parts from cop shows, exploitation flicks and comic books, it nevertheless comes to life."
0,"The pity is that with a bit more care and flair, it could have been a really sweet little movie."
1,"For all its throwaway humour, this is basically just a pleasant reworking of the kids versus adults rock'n'roll movie format of the '50s."
1,It's more cleverly cut than shot -- which means that it moves quickly and energetically even as the concepts and characters disintegrate.
1,The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.
1,"The memorable combination of the torturous gym workouts, the runs through the streets of Philadelphia and the carcass-beating in the abattoir all combine beautifully as Balboa trains 'to eat lightning and crap thunder'."
1,"A description of it would sound like a cliche from beginning to end. But Rocky isn't about a story, it's about a hero. And it's inhabited with supreme confidence by a star."
0,"The screenplay of Rocky is purest Hollywood make-believe of the 1930's, but there would be nothing wrong with that, had the film been executed with any verve."
1,Rocky is an old-fashioned fairytale brilliantly revamped to chime in with the depressed mood of the '70s.
1,"I wanted to like it more than I did, but it'll do."
1,"There are occasional flashes that the film may be patronizing the lower end of the blue-collar mentality, as much if not more than the characters who keep putting Rocky down on the screen. However, Avildsen is noted for creating such ambiguities."
0,"The story is achingly familiar, and though Stallone has a certain power, he is certainly not the subtlest actor to crawl out from under Marlon's overcoat."
1,Sylvester Stallone [is] as likable as a basset hound.
1,"In addition to a heart-warming script, Stallone has created on the screen a character of enormous appeal and charm -- half-articulate but funny, gruff but good-hearted."
1,"Like the movies of Frank Capra, Rocky is a glowing tribute to the human spirit - a chin-up reminder that the decent, little guys of the world often accomplish the impossible if only because they try so hard."
1,The success of the film depends upon Whiting and Miss Hussey... They are magnificent.
1,"Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is a lovely, sensitive, friendly popularization of the play..."
1,Mostly it remains enjoyable for its color and visual flair.
1,"High-minded and lively, with heartbreakingly beautiful actors on show, and all shot in a kind of honeycomb-sunglow light."
1,"The sets are tight and stagey, every corner is decorated with baroque lushness, every shot framed by a velvet curtain or silvery branch. And the dialogue isn't caged in by any attempts at naturalism."
1,"All these years later, as a reminder that every oddball fits in somewhere, it still shines. You could even say it glows."
1,Rudolph would be nothing without its colorful cast of supporting characters-none of which Marks apparently felt worthy of inclusion in his original song.
1,"This classic tale is still beloved today, as its feel-good story about the most famous reindeer of all wins every kid (and, fine, adult) over."
1,In some sense one might think of it as the mother recipe of the American Christmas special.
0,Mr. Crichton has a much better feel for the film's gadgets than for its human players.
0,"Once it turns from the hardware and the action to people, you can hardly believe your eyes or your ears."
0,This Michael Crichton robotic nightmare is so trite that the story seems lifted from Marvel Comics.
1,"This genre is so overpopulated that it hardly seems like we need one more example, and yet ""Running Scared"" transcends its dreary roots and turns out to be a lot of fun."
0,"Another, thoroughly depressing demonstration of the extent to which television now dictates the style and the manners of so many of the movies we see in theaters."
1,"Crystal and Hines do flavour the film with genuine warmth, and despite some cheap gags, work well together to produce some truly funny moments."
0,"""Running Scared"" tries to be a light comedy in a violent, comic-book world. That's a difficult juggling act, and director Peter Hyams doesn't pull it off."
1,A functional 1986 actioner about two wisecracking Chicago cops (Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal) and their vendetta against a Latino crime lord (Jimmy Smits).
1,"No more original or eventful than an average police TV show, so it must sink or swim on the moment-by-moment cleverness of the dialog and the behavioral talents of Hines and Crystal. Fortunately, these elements prove formidable."
1,"We won't tell you what happens. That would be to cheat Mr. Hitchcock of his just reward, but it is a warning what you may expect -- which, as is the way of all Hitchcock melodramas, is the unexpected."
1,"Hampered by an unimaginative script ... nevertheless manages to be a thoroughly charming, delightfully romantic variation of the Cinderella story."
1,"It is a story as light as a feather and as old as yesterday's news, as transparent as a society column item and as smug as a foreign-made car. But Mr. Wilder...has made it into a commentary as crisp as a screed in a smart magazine."
1,Abundant charm and humour
1,"It's a Cinderella story that gets turned on its head, a satire about breaking down class and emotional barriers, and a confrontation between New World callousness and Old World humanity."
1,Wilder's tastelessness now seems his major artistic strength.
1,"Script is long on glibly quipping dialog, dropped with a seemingly casual air, and broadly played situations. The splendid trouping delivers them style. Leavening the chuckles are tugs at the heart."
1,"This is never less than glittering entertainment, but somehow a certain measure of lead has found its way into the formula."
1,Constantly through the cleverness of individual situations Sabrina seems to override what is wrong with its plot and even its motivation.
1,"""Sahara"" is a laudable conception of soldier fortitude in this war, and it is also a bang-up action picture, cut out to hold one enthralled."
1,Watchable more for its strong cast than for its credibility or its pretensions ...
1,"Packed with pithy dialog, lusty action and suspense, and logically and well-devised situations avoiding ultra-theatrics throughout."
0,"If you'll settle for gold-plated pageants, for muscular episodes and for graphic inducements to wolf-whistling, then ""Samson and Delilah"" is for you."
1,Wonderfully chintzy and hokey Bible epic once described as the only film in which the hero had bigger tits than the heroine.
1,"Cecil B. DeMille has again dipped into the Bible for his material, made appropriately dramatic revisions in the original, and turned up with a DeMille-size smash."
1,"It's Cecil B. DeMille at his most lavish, with a screenful of sets, costumes and dramatic effects."
0,"The quality of the film's inventiveness is not always of the first order, which is too bad because Mr. Cronenberg does seem to be a director-writer of some style."
0,"Scanners is so lockstep that we are basically reduced to watching the special effects, which are good but curiously abstract, because we don't much care about the people they're happening around."
1,"Part conspiracy thriller, part political tract, it is Cronenberg's most coherent movie to date, drawing a dark (but bland) world in which corporate executives engineer human conception to produce ever more powerful mental samurai."
1,"Like Tod Browning, Cronenberg doesn't have the stylistic resources to match the forcefulness of his ideas, but his movies remain in the mind for the pull of their private obsessions."
0,"All this should give fans of David Cronenberg's previous pix their money's worth, although lack of any rooting interest vitiates any possible suspense and highly elegant visual style works against much shock value."
0,"Scanners, according to David Cronenberg's new film, are people who can control others with their thoughts...The idea has a certain cachet. But Scanners doesn't pay off on it."
1,"There are fine moments, as there would have to be with Hackman and Pacino."
0,"I assume that Schatzberg and White wanted somehow to ennoble Max and Lionel, but they sentimentalize them."
0,Schatzberg throws away the more interesting implications in order to make emotional hay.
0,Periodically interesting but ultimately unsatisfying.
1,This is a jewel of American cinema.
1,"This is no lost classic, but Pacino/Hackman superfans could do a lot, lot worse."
1,As a picture of blue-collar America the film is credible and compassionate.
1,Hollywood movies have rarely spoken such tough and tender truths.
1,This is an excellent diversion for those who like to take an afternoon or an evening off to study the activities of cowardly thugs. In it Paul Muni as Scarface Tony Camonte gives a compelling portrayal.
1,"Its seminal importance in the early gangster movie cycle outweighed only by its still exhilarating brilliance, this Howard Hughes production was the one unflawed classic the tycoon was involved with."
1,"Scarface contains more cruelty than any of its gangster picture predecessors, but there's a squarer for every killing. The blows are always softened by judicial preachments and sad endings for the sinners."
1,"Scarface is a grisly, exciting gangster picture, based in part upon the career of Alphonse (""Scarface,"" ""Snorkey"") Capone."
1,"Howard Hawks's 1932 masterpiece is a dark, brutal, exhilaratingly violent film, blending comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun."
1,Scarface is one of best of the early gangster movies; its wit and building velocity speeds it past Little Caesar and keeps pace with Public Enemy.
1,By far the most visually inventive and tonally anarchic movie that Hawks made.
1,"What it has, and what the many other gangster films that have followed it have not, is an ice-cold anger of purpose."
0,"Unlike the great musicals, where you might find yourself humming a tune a few days later, with Scrooge, you'll be lucky if you remember the name of one of the songs a few hours later."
1,Scrooge works very nicely on its intended level and the kids sitting near me seemed to be having a good time.
1,"Even Scrooge's fingernails are dirty, and while I don't think that Dickens intended to equate greed with unwashed hands, he probably would not have objected."
0,A misbegotten musical adaptation of Dickens' much too perennial tale.
1,Finney's performance as cold-hearted Scrooge is a professional high-water mark.
0,"If [Farrow] displays a narrow emotional range, that is less the fault of the actress than of the film makers."
1,You've got to hand it to Alfred Hitchcock: when he sows the fearful seeds of mistrust in one of his motion pictures he can raise more goose pimples to the square inch of a customer's flesh than any other director of thrillers in Hollywood.
1,One of Hitchcock's finest films of the '40s.
1,Hitchcock deftly etches his small-town characters and homey surroundings.
1,"This Hitchcock masterpiece has the same general theme as his Suspicion -- the slow, terrible growth of fear of a loved one. But Shadow, from beginning to end, is a surpassingly better picture."
1,Alfred Hitchcock's first indisputable masterpiece.
1,"No one would ever accuse Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt of being plausible, but it is framed so distinctively in the Hitchcock style that it plays firmly and never breaks out of the story."
1,Peels back the welcoming warmth and sincere innocence of small-town life to reveal the gullibility and the na챦vet챕 underneath; it's a fiction about the perpetuation of fictions.
1,A series of tense dramatic scenes superbly acted by Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright.
1,"Master of the suspense drama that he is, Hitchcock keeps his climax for the very end. When it comes it is terrific. The final curtain Is a glorious piece of cynicism."
1,"Shadow of a Doubt may or may not be Hitchcock's greatest film, but it's his most intimate and heart-wrenching."
1,"The attraction to them will be the stylish conversation and attitudes, as well as Richard Roundtree, who lends Shaft the right amount of charisma, swagger and untouchability."
0,"Parks isn't especially good at action direction, but the heart of a private-eye movie is in the mood scenes, anyway, and he supplies a scene in a bar and another one with the Harlem rackets boss that are very nice."
1,"A hip, cool, entertaining thriller."
1,"Forty years of gumshoe noir collided with black power in this 1971 action classic, the most popular of the blaxploitation pictures."
1,"Excellent cast, headed by newcomer Richard Roundtree, may shock some audiences with heavy dose of candid dialog and situation."
0,"If Shaft were indeed a hard-hitting, fast-paced, action-packed detective thriller, as it was meant to be, then it would be an acceptable entertainment. But it isn't."
1,"A good, gutsy crime yarn in the 'forties style."
0,"This 1959 film was Disney's first live-action comedy; it isn't good, but it's certainly mythic."
0,Brisk but unrewarding.
1,There are a good many laughs on this simple premise and the script's exploitation of them.
0,"Unhappily, Producer Walt Disney tells his shaggy-dog story so doggedly that he soon runs it into the pound."
1,"It's an assembly of sensational moments, strung together by a plot that provides the excuses for amazing stunts, and not much else. But then not much else is needed."
0,"In ''Shakedown,'' something fancy happens every 15 minutes or so, which is part of what makes the whole film so unremarkable."
1,This heady mix of sleaze and comic book heroes smacks of big box office bucks and a long life on the video shelf. There ain't many better accolades than that.
1,"A rollicking, thrilling and funny police picture that makes ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and its sequel look as if they were photographed in slow motion."
0,The problem with routine crime and law enforcement fantasies of this kind is that their vague stabs at authenticity are completely subverted by action sequences that belong in Road Runner cartoons.
1,Mindlessly enjoyable escapist fare in which a courtroom drama is enlivened by intercutting it with a couple of wholly improbable but spectacular chases in--and above--New York.
1,Hellman's tight telephoto shots press the characters entomologically against the barren landscape; he revels in the technical charms of the medium and the scruffiness of his B-movie budget as audaciously as a French New Wave director.
1,"The sound is poor. The colour erratic. It looks as if it has been shot on the backlot of Republic Pictures instead of on location. Yet better than any Western I have sees in, well, years, it conveys the original suspense of the genre."
0,"It's basically a kid's movie, and quite possibly the kids will like it. But they'll have to be fairly young kids."
1,"The movie, which has the clean, well-scrubbed look of an old Disney comedy, is nicely acted by Miss Sheedy, who demonstrates a light-comedy touch not unlike Amy Irving's [and] Mr. Guttenberg."
1,A message film to please all ages.
1,Scripters get credit for some terrific dialog that would have been a lot less disarming if not for the winsome robot and Sheedy's affection for it. Guttenberg plays his best goofy self.
0,The film has nowhere to go except to give us a predictable initial confrontation between Guttenberg and Sheedy over military weapons.
0,One of the stranger ironies to be found in Hollywood these days is that some of its most resourceful directors use high-tech wizardry and state-of- the-art movie technology to make films that rail against the tyranny of science.
1,"It is mad, but the wonderful dexterity and the air of perpetually buttressed dignity with which Mr. Sellers plays his role make what could quickly be monotonous enjoyable to the end."
0,"First of the Pink Panther sequels, establishing Sellers' incompetent Inspector Clouseau as a viable series character, and prompting Blake Edwards into an unchallenging downhill coast for far too long."
1,Sometimes the narrative is subordinated to individual bits of business and running gags but Sellers' skill as a comedian again is demonstrated.
0,"This isn't quite up to the original, but it has its moments."
0,"""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" takes off from the notion that Santa Claus is an ax murderer, but it never quite lives up to the delicious perversity of its premise."
0,"We're not knocking the transformation of a hallowed holiday figure into a homicidal maniac...it's the pleasure Billy and the movie take in leering at, then dicing up young women that lands Charles E. Sellier Jr.'s sicko Santa on our worst list."
1,"An uncommonly clever and gripping suspense thriller. Even after the story threatens to self-destruct, you fight the impulse to suffer a major letdown, for the sake of the swell nerve-racking time you've been having up to that point."
1,"It is a taut, unassuming thriller with some pleasing, if predictable, twists, and the director, Daryl Duke, makes the most of Gould's bear-like looks and good humour."
1,
0,
0,Littered with a kind of cheap shot humor that inflicts only flesh wounds on the sitting ducks of mass culture.
1,"There's wit, rudeness, satire, lust and pathos, all effortlessly rolled up together."
1,"The colors are rich, the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands."
1,"Although this rarely achieves the heights of classics like Snow White and Dumbo, it still has its moments."
1,Mary Costa's rich and expressive voice for the title character gives substance and strength to it.
0,"The hero and heroine are sugar sculpture, and the witch looks like a clumsy tracing from a Charles Addams cartoon."
1,The masterpiece of the Disney Studios' postwar style.
1,"It is a picture that will charm the young and tickle adults, since the old fairy tale has been transferred to the screen by a Disney who kept his tongue in his cheek throughout the film's animation."
1,"Sleeping Beauty Is a magnificent achievement, offering suspense, action and happy humor, in a truly giant-size package."
0,"Friedkin hints at political themes, but the film suffers most from condescendingly over-emphatic direction, and a generally tedious, relentless grimy realism in the opening half hour."
0,"William Friedkin's Sorcerer is a painstaking, admirable, but mostly distant and uninvolving suspenser based on the French classic The Wages of Fear."
0,"The new movie is handsomely shot and crisply edited. Why, then, does one rather distantly respect it instead of just plain liking it? It is an odd, disappointing feeling to take away from a summertime movie."
1,"First and foremost a lavish entertainment, no matter its brief examination of oil politics."
1,"By the time Sorcerer gets around to its rain-soaked, rickety-bridge set piece, you'll either be obsessed or fully checked out. Give yourself a chance to pick sides."
1,"Sorcerer is a stunning reimagining of a masterpiece, one that crucially doesn't try to replicate what came before. Instead, it follows its own dangerous path."
1,"A fierce, austere and intriguing film: a cinematic concerto of pessimism."
0,"One can't help wondering if Sorcerer was awarded a ""PG"" rating before or after it was screened."
1,"It's a rags-to-riches story that doesn't miss a stop along the well-trod ghetto-to-musical-charts path, but makes its journey with tuneful conviction."
0,"Hackneyed, ho-hum 1976 feature about a black girl group, clearly modeled on the Supremes."
1,
1,"Of all the historical epics, this pretty much takes the biscuit, with an unbelievable cast, incredible cinematography and plenty of quotable scenes."
1,"The most courageous thing about it, from today's standards, is that it closes without an obligatory happy ending, and an audience that has watched for 187 minutes doesn't get a tidy, mindless conclusion."
0,"It is a spotty, uneven drama."
1,Asurprisingly apt companion piece to Paths of Glory in its consideration of the mechanisms of power.
1,This may be the most literate of all the spectacles set in antiquity.
1,Douglas is terrific as the iron-jawed slave fuelled by righteous fury.
1,"The great-granddaddy of Ridley Scott's Gladiator hasn't lost any muscle tone after nearly half a century, and Kirk Douglas's direct, unpretentious performance as the great slave-rebel Spartacus is more engaging than ever."
1,
0,Its appeal is based almost entirely on regression -- a thematic regression to infancy and a stylistic regression to the most lulling kind of TV blandness.
1,"Splash may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists."
0,It's too bad the relentlessly conventional minds that made this movie couldn't have made the leap from sitcom to comedy.
1,"Howard demonstrates exactly the correct soft touch, skirting the myriad problems of taste."
1,"Although film is a bit uneven, production benefits from a tasty look, an airy tone, and a delectable, unblemished performance from Hannah."
1,A romantic comedy that is as salty and bracing as a plunge in the surf.
1,"It's a rambunctious comedy, coming from director Ron Howard who, with his previous, wacky Night Shift, unarguably shows that beneath that Opie Taylor/Richie Cunningham persona, there's a wild and crazy spirit."
1,"Splash, an aquacade of myth and laughter, glimmers like moonlit tide. It's an enrapturing underwater romance pairing dry-lander Tom Hanks with mermaid Daryl Hannah (not an easy affair for a nonswimmer)."
0,A movie in which leering and beer-drinking are everybody's favorite pursuits.
0,"It doesn't know that girls are people, too."
0,"The Squeeze is a non-movie held together only by the intrinsic appeal of Michael Keaton and Rae Dawn Chong, its stars. They are given nothing to work with here. Nothing."
0,"At the end of this nonsense, to be sure, there is a massacre to brighten things up a little. But then the pall sets in again."
1,John Ford has swept aside ten years of artifice and talkie compromise and has made a motion picture that sings a song of camera.
1,"Impossible to overstate the influence of Ford's magnificent film, generally considered to be the first modern Western."
1,"Seen today, Stagecoach may not seem very original. That's because it influenced countless later movies in which a mixed bag of characters are thrown together by chance and forced to survive an ordeal."
1,Its virtues remain intact.
1,"Directorially, production is John Ford in peak form, sustaining interest and suspense throughout, and presenting exceptional characterizations. Picture is a display of photographic grandeur."
1,"The rugged background of Monument Valley, Ariz..., the admirable pace given to the screen play by Writer Dudley Nichols and Director John Ford, the unostentatious acting of a well-chosen cast make it one of the season's most satisfactory pictures."
1,"One of the most fascinating motion pictures ever released is Walter Wanger's Stagecoach, which definitely should go on your ""must see"" list. In fact, I urge you to go out of your way to see it."
0,"One is strongly suspicious, after watching this helter-skelter film, that Mr. Hitchcock was much less interested in his over-all story than in individual scenes."
1,"A fairly routine thriller, noted chiefly for its cheating flashback, though with much more to enjoy than its detractors -- including Hitchcock -- make out."
1,Wyman is delightful as embryo actress but the choice femme spot goes to Dietrich.
1,"The issues aren't satisfactorily resolved, but Hitchcock seems to be exploring the ways in which various falsehoods -- the falsehoods of acting, storytelling, and art in general -- can lead to the truth"
1,"Hitchcock conjures a deep-rooted, irony-rich complicity of father and daughter that seems borrowed from the films of Howard Hawks and suggests the inner compass that helps to guard against chasing the wrong man."
1,This 1950 thriller is minor only by the standards of genius.
1,You might want to stake out a theater near you.
1,"Dreyfuss and his style are the two best things in ""Stakeout,"" a movie that consists of a good idea surrounded by a bad one."
1,A mature human farce that values characters' foibles over their firearms.
1,The director uses the conventions of the action-comedy in so adroit a way that you may even forget the hundred other films you've seen lately about a couple of cops kidding around with each other in between battling the bad guys.
1,"Between Lecce's illicit courtship and Reimers' consternation, there are some hearty laughs of a juvenile nature."
1,"Slick, sure-footed entertainment, one part buddy comedy and one part police actioner stitched together with a dash of romance."
1,"Good entertainment by any standards, including the artistic, and convincing proof that Hollywood need not travel to Ruritania for its plots; there is drama aplenty in its own backyard."
1,"Wellman's non-musical version, though starting more sentimentally with Gaynor as a wide-eyed innocent dreaming every girl's dream of stardom... develops a much more caustic edge, maintaining a bitterly critical distance from the dream factory."
1,The highly commendable results are achieved with a minimum of satiric hokum and a maximum of honest story telling.
1,"this 1937 William Wellman-David O. Selznick production (itself a partial remake of Cukor's 1932 What Price Hollywood?) is extremely watchable, not least because of the Technicolor portrait it paints of art deco Hollywood."
1,Does the industry a marked service. Without missing its comedies or its fascinations of whitewashing its follies and its heartbreaks it contrives to give an essentially authentic and a wholesome portrait.
1,"Of all Hollywood's heartbreakers, this must be one of the saddest."
1,One of the grandest heartbreak dramas that has drenched the screen in years... the Warners and Mr. Cukor have really and truly gone to town in giving this hackneyed Hollywood story an abundance of fullness and form.
1,A Star Is Born was a great 1937 moneymaker and it's an even greater picture in its filmusical transmutation.
1,"All this, + a dozen big musical sequences, makes Star a mighty long gulp of champagne; but, like champagne, it is hard to refuse."
1,Judy Garland gives everything she has as the young star on the way up; her performance is an emotional autobiography.
1,A Star Is Born is the perfect blend of drama and musical - of cinematic art and popular entertainment.
0,"We can't feel a thing between Kristofferson and Streisand. We don't sense any chemistry, we don't know why these two people are drawn to each other and why they should be important to each other."
0,"A transistorized remake, louder than ever, but very small in terms of its being about anything whatsoever."
0,This version vaunts its modernity by vulgarising everything in sight.
1,The new A Star Is Born has the rare distinction of being a superlative remake.
1,"Barbra Streisand's fantastic singing voice shows to the best advantage her incredible talent. The movie falls short of greatness, but it compares more than favorably not only with the usual concert film but also with the current love stories on film."
0,"A Star is Born rarely stops seeming manufactured; it can't disguise its manipulations or the process of the storytelling. You see the tangled strings, not the puppets."
0,"The trouble with rock 'n' roll in A Star Is Born is that there isn't any. The soundtrack is filled with homogenized harmonics passing for rock, but not a single song is good enough even to be counterfeit."
1,"If there's one thing that's absolutely first-rate about the film, it's the character of Cruella."
1,"A rather clever idea, if a bit unsettling."
1,Brilliant entertainment.
1,This was the last Disney animated feature (1961) that Uncle Walt lived to see through personally; it can't be a coincidence that it's also the last Disney animated feature of real depth and emotional authenticity.
1,"While not as indelibly enchanting or inspired as some of the studio's most unforgettable animated endeavors, this is nonetheless a painstaking creative effort."
1,"It is the wittiest, most charming, least pretentious cartoon feature Walt Disney has ever made."
1,"This loveable romp evokes a gloomy, starlit London of Georgian streets and quietly grand parks."
1,
1,"Way before Guy Ritchie's polished bad boy style and hugely complicated plot twists pulled in the punters, The Sting pioneered the genre."
1,"The movie has a nice, light-fingered style to it."
1,"The film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it."
1,"The film ends up relying on different chapter headings to explain what's going on, but it's all very professional, with fine attention to period detail."
1,Top-notch entertainment.
1,Extremely handsome production values and a great supporting cast round out the virtues.
0,"Newman and Redford pass a few facial expressions between them and try to cool each other out. If there ever was much of a script, it can be said to have gone to waste."
1,The Sting remains the definitive con artist comedy: as irresistible and ingenious as the scheme that hooks in Doyle.
1,"As for Newman and Redford, they have developed a form of instant communication. Words are not as important as they way they look at each other. Call it as snow job or call it acting, it is very pleasing to watch."
1,"The Sting adopts the playful, quasi-comedic tone evident throughout much of Butch Cassidy. On the whole, however, this is a more upbeat endeavor."
1,"Welles' third film, often described as his worst, but still a hugely enjoyable thriller."
0,"The whole film, produced by S. P. Eagle, comes off a bloodless, manufactured show."
1,"Orson Welles's 1946 film reproduces his personal themes of self-scrutiny and self-destruction only in outline, though it is an inventive, highly enjoyable thriller."
1,"The Stranger is socko melodrama, spinning an intriguing web of thrills and chills."
1,"Adroitly directed by Orson Welles, who also plays the star, it is a grade A gooseflesh-raiser."
1,"Despite the overwhelming power of Brando's performance, Streetcar is one of the great ensemble pieces in the movies."
1,Brando's performance as Stanley is one of those rare screen legends that are all they're cracked up to be.
1,"The camera has done greater justice to the Williams play, catching the nuances and reflected tragedy with an intimacy that is so vital in a story of this type."
1,Inner torments are seldom projected with such sensitivity and clarity on the screen.
1,...Kazan achieves a sort of theatrical intensity in which the sweaty realism sometimes clashes awkwardly with the stylisation that heightens the dialogue into a kind of poetry.
1,"...if the hothouse style was ever justified, this is the occasion."
1,"The blistering sexual repression is the entire point of the 1950s. Quite simply, fabulous."
1,"The film is perhaps best regarded as an intelligent and engaged recreation of the original Broadway experience, in which Jessica Tandy first played the role. There's no denying the awful horror and pity of the final scene."
1,"it's a close-to-definitive example of how to make a great play work on film, for all the very slight air of Hollywood compromise."
0,"There's an inevitable staginess to Tennessee Williams' devastating portrait of delusion and cruelty, but director Elia Kazan catches the squalid, claustrophobic atmosphere of a New Orleans tenement just right."
1,Vivien Leigh gives one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke pity and terror.
1,"Some movie goers will be bored by its unlovely subject and wealth of talk, but others will admire it as an excursion into art."
1,Elia Kazan's claustrophobic close-ups do a fine job of recreating the intensity of the stage.

1,"The moral is a sweet one: If you try, you never fail. The world is graded on a curve."
0,"A comedy so listless, leisurely and unspirited that it was an act of the will for me to care about it, even while I was watching it."
0,"Here are some of Summer School's favorite things: idiocy, illiteracy, irresponsibility, drunkenness, dumbness and debauchery. Piqued?"
0,"Mr. Harmon has an easygoing attractiveness, but neither he nor anyone else seems comfortable with the film's antic pace. And for all its busyness, this comedy has no real focus, ricocheting from character to character with wearying abandon."
1,"A bit bland compared to Reiner's Steve Martin comedies, but engagingly played."
1,"An endearing, convulsively funny and faintly thoughtful hot-weather entertainment."
1,A touching Fred Zinnemann movie.
0,"Zinnemann's customary care for detail pays occasional dividends, but the film goes on rather too long."
0,Neil Simon's most irritating play is no less agonizing on the screen under Herbert Ross's sycophantic direction.
1,"Mr. Matthau is so good playing old men, we may never know when he finally becomes one."
1,"The Sunshine Boys is an extremely sensitive and lovable film version of Neil Simon's play, with Walter Matthau and George Burns outstanding in their starring roles as a pair of long-hostile vaudeville partners."
0,"Suspect is a well-made thriller, but it was spoiled for me by an extraordinary closing scene where Cher, as the defense attorney, solves the case with all of the logic of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat."
1,Mr. Hitchcock is probably the most artful sophist working for the films -- and anyone who doesn't think so should see Suspicion.
1,"Despite a silly cop-out ending (imposed by RKO), a gripping domestic thriller."
1,"Everyone concedes that this 1941 Hitchcock film is a failure, yet it displays so much artistic seriousness that I find its failure utterly mysterious."
1,"Alfred Hitchcock's trademarked cinematic development of suspenseful drama, through mental emotions of the story principals, is vividly displayed in Suspicion."
1,
0,Suspicion is good Alfred Hitchcock-up to the last few minutes. In those final minutes the picture falls apart at the seams.
1,"At times even the audience believes as the woman does. At other times doubt intrudes. This is where Suspicion shines as especially deft and adroit, and loyal also to Hitchcock precedent for keeping both characters and spectators guessing."
0,"This cynical, coruscating drama has a strong look of being contrived, and Mr. Brooks' happy ending for it is implausible and absurd."
1,"Brooks' direction seems a little too stolid for all the sleazy, flaming passions. These are, however, given full measure by an excellent cast."
1,"It's a glossy, engrossing hunk of motion picture entertainment, slickly produced by Berman."
0,"Offers little indication of what made the original play interesting (especially in Elia Kazan's stage production), despite the fact that Paul Newman and Geraldine Page are called on to reprise their original roles."
1,"Of all of the places the movies have created, one of the most magical and enduring is the universe of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers."
1,Nothing so intangible as a disappointing musical score should deter you from enjoying them to the Astaire-Rogers limit.
1,The score by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields is peerless.
1,"Another winner for the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers combo. It's smart, modern, and impressive in every respect, from its boy-loses-girl background to its tunefulness, dancipation, production quality and general high standards."
1,"One of the best of the Astaire-Rogers musicals, and one that shouldn't have worked as well as it did."
1,"It's hard to imagine how the picture could be better as a rousing, humorous and gentle-hearted tale of family love amid primitive isolation and dangers."
0,"The Swiss Family Robinson, like most of Walt Disney's screen versions of the children's classics, is good Disney and bad culture."
0,"As for Mr. Zeffirelli's settings and the elaborate Renaissance costumes, they look very rich and mellow in the misty pastel colors that are used. But they, too, like Nino Rota's music, tend to monotony."
1,Comedy is sustained in witty wedding ceremony.
0,More debased Shakespeare from Franco Zeffirelli.
0,"To describe the film as inept would be to miss the point, which is to present Mrs. Derek in as many different poses, nude and seminude, as there are days of the year, all in something less than two hours."
0,"Of course it's completely ridiculous, but at the same time it has a certain disarming charm."
0,"Judging by the amount of time everybody spends swimming, the African jungle resembles Hornsey Baths filled with oversized pot plants."
0,This opus will disappoint both Tarzan fans and Bo admirers.
0,"The movie is an ambitious experiment, but a long and tedious one, and our revels end long before Mazursky's."
1,"Mazursky lets it all run too long, by a half-hour at least, but he also offers a menu of rare delights."
1,"It's the gigantic vulgarity, the obsessive righteousness of the director himself, which keeps the show on the road and suffuses the movie with its daft power."
1,DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking.
1,"With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute."
0,
1,"DeMille's direction of the action is superb and the various roles are played with feeling by a large and competent cast, headed by Charlton Heston."
1,"There is no other picture like it. There will be none. If it could be summed up in a word, the word would be sublime. And the man responsible for that, when all is said and done is Cecil B. DeMille."
1,"Decently budgeted and atmospheric, it's a sober accomplishment in a cycle that would quickly turn to self-parody."
1,By far the best of the '50s cycle of 'creature features.'
1,Definitely a chiller.
1,"This science-fiction shocker has a well-plotted story [by George Worthington Yates, adapted by Russell Hughes], expertly directed and acted in a matter-of-fact style."
1,"Shivers, written and directed by Cronenberg, is a paranoid, prurient sexual nightmare."
1,Despite all the nastiness there is a compulsive nature to this film that makes it very hard to switch off even when in full gory swing.
0,"The film is so tackily written and directed, so darkly photographed and the sound so dimly recorded, that it's difficult to stay with it."
1,[Walsh's] personal response to the material puts it across.
1,"For fanciers of hard-boiled cinema, They Drive By Night still offers an entertaining ride."
1,"Fast moving and actionful melodrama of long-haul trucking biz, They Drive clicks with plenty of entertainment content."
1,The pugnacity of Walsh's comic direction infuses turbulently free enterprise with tragedy.
0,"Mr. Mann may well become a very good theatrical film maker but, among other things, he's going to have to learn how to edit himself, to resist the temptation to allow dialogue that is colorful to turn, all of a sudden, into deep, abiding purple."
1,"It's one of those films where you feel the authority right away: This movie knows its characters, knows its story, and knows exactly how it wants to tell us about them."
1,A philosophical thriller filled with modernist cool.
1,A slick Chicago crime-drama with a well-developed sense of pathos running throughout.
1,"The overall message of The Thing emerges as distinctly hawkish. Reactionary or not, though, it's still a masterpiece."
0,"The resourcefulness shown in building the plot groundwork is lacking as the yarn gets into full swing. Cast members, headed by Margaret Sheridan and Kenneth Tobey, fail to communicate any real terror."
1,"The film has more frissons than most of today's mega-budget productions, simply because it has the grace to construct a meaningful situation and coherent characters."
1,Set the template for a decade of alien invasions.
1,This is one of those rare remakes that remains faithful to the premise of the original but does something unique with the concept.
0,"Mr. Carpenter has demonstrated that he can make good, comparatively plain, old-fashioned scare movies and effective suspense thrillers, but he seems to lose his own head when he combines two or more genres, as he [does here]."
0,"Because this material has been done before, and better, especially in the original The Thing and Alien, there's no need to see this version."
0,"Russell's sub-Eastwood heroics hardly compensate for the absence of all characterisation, while Bill Lancaster's script boasts the most illogical climax any monster movie ever had."
0,"If it's the most vividly guesome monster ever to stalk the screen that audiences crave, then The Thing is the thing. On all other levels, however, John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi classic comes as a letdown."
1,"The special effects can't hope to be as creepy to our seen-it-all eyes as they were to the film's first viewers, but we can still enjoy the monster's unique weirdness, and the story is a rock-solid yarn."
1,"It's pretty scary and entertaining stuff, though I always get the feeling that nothing in it lives up to the tremendous opening section."
0,"Carpenter's direction is slow, dark, and stately; he seems to be aiming for an enveloping, novelistic kind of effect, but all he gets is heaviness."
1,"The Thing is set in an all-male environment, and is as much a study of masculinity in crisis as an update of the sort of siege scenario that Carpenter had already played out in Assault on Precinct 13."
1,"[U]nlike most exercises in hematic excess--Richard Rodriguez's Planet Terror, for instance, or Tarantino's Kill Bill--Thirst offers not the consolations of camp but the intensity of opera."
1,"The film's thrilling bullet-laden finale, fast pace and lovely black-and-white photography more than makes up for some of the overt misogyny that was common in this genre and era."
0,"It's a calamity of a comedy, the perfect complement to concession-stand nachos con cheez."
0,The script of Three Amigos plays like it was slapped together by a few friends with a tape recorder enjoying a charming weekend at the beach.
0,"All great farces need a certain insane focus, an intensity that declares how important they are to themselves. This movie is too confident, too relaxed, too clever to be really funny."
0,"Three Amigos is likable, but it never really finds a distinctive style. Not quite parody and not quite serious, it's more like a lengthy costume party."
1,"If you enjoy brainless slapstick that allows space for irrelvant absurdities like a singing bush and an invisible swordsman, it's entertaining enough."
0,A few choice morsels of brilliant humor can't save Three Amigos! from missing the whole enchilada.
0,It's the laziness of the project that's finally most galling.
1,"[Three Amigos is] a goofy delight. It's like a cross between a big-budget Three Stooges movie and a Hope-Crosby road picture, with dozens of old cowpoke gags thrown in to spice up the brew."
0,"While it's occasionally funny, Three Amigos! isn't an entirely fun occasion."
0,You know it's a boring comedy when you find yourself laughing only at the lead actors' costumes.
0,The happy-go-lucky Three Amigos is a picture to see when your expectations are down and you've already been to everything that's good.
0,On the whole there's not a lot of flesh on these cynically haphazard bones.
1,"Not Rosi's best, but still an important film by a major talent."
1,"A big cast, brilliant color and lots of action have been combined for entertaining results."
0,"The drama, for all its invention, is creaky and a bit pass."
0,"The quaint time machine and Oscar-winning special effects hold one's interest initially, but the overall effect is one of glossy emptiness."
0,"Parts of it are colorful and imaginative, but the film flattens out toward the end."
1,"A heaven-sent opportunity for [director Ken Russell] to exercise his gift for going too far, for creating three-ring cinematic circuses with kinky sideshows."
1,"It's all fairly excessive and far from subtle, but in this case good taste would have been wildly inappropriate and a fearful drag."
0,"This is both the movie in which [Russell] is most faithful to the ideas and tone of his material, and one of his very worst films."
1,Ken Russell's filmization of Tommy is spectacular in nearly every way.
1,"One thing is sure: there has never been a movie musical quite like Tommy, a weird, crazy, wonderfully excessive version of The Who's rock opera."
0,"This 1975 film's inventiveness begins to flag about halfway through, but by then it's a relief. If only Wagner could have lived to see this."
1,"Can't get it out of my head, for better and worse."
1,What's really interesting about Tommy is that it is about how the generation who led the pop revolution of the 60s had vivid but undisclosed memories of their wartime childhoods.
1,"Top Secret! comes nowhere near Airplane! but in its own cheerful, low-pressure way, it's about as amiable an entertainment as you will find this summer."
1,This movie will cheerfully go for a laugh wherever one is even remotely likely to be found.
0,Signs of desperation have begun to creep in some time before the end.
1,Secret! shares the same wonderful wacky attitude that allows just about any kind of gag to come flowing in and out of the picture at the strangest times.
1,"The plot combines the rock musical with the spy thriller (not to mention assorted other genres), and the comic invention is fairly constant."
0,"This time, though, the creative group has neglected to build to the kind of giddy, everything-+-the-kitchen-sink climax that made Airplane! such a memorable exercise in anarchy."
1,"The trio of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker approach movie comedy as a systematic exaggeration of genre cliche's designed to sustain 90 minutes of infectiously silly non sequiturs and sight gags."
1,"The near universality of male errancy in Torso certainly makes it difficult to guess the identity of the killer - but it also points to another message in Martino's work, inscribed expressionistically by men on the bodies of women."
1,the camera work and blocking have the coordination of an Olympic pole vaulter
1,[a] dark and extravagant crime drama
1,Touch of Evil may be the sleaziest good movie ever made.
0,"It's a flurry of pressure-cooker baroque, an extreme example of the exhibitionistic hijinks in which Welles could sometimes indulge, apparently intensified here because he wasn't doing what he really wanted to be doing."
1,"The film has always been full of reckless energy, and now it is, as they say, better than ever."
1,The film has always been a favorite of those who enjoy visual and dramatic flamboyance.
1,Touch of Evil is a savvy starter because Welles' astonishing cinematic invention and his persuasive presence as star are prime noir at tractions.
1,One of a few monumental 1950s swan songs marking the end of the great epoch of traditional studio filmmaking.
0,Touch of Evil smacks of brilliance but ultimately flounders in it.
1,one of [Welles'] richest and most rewarding pictures
1,"Where Mr. Welles soundly succeeds is in generating enough sinister electricity for three such yarns and in generally staging it like a wild, murky nightmare."
1,"A sweaty thriller conundrum on character and corruption, justice and the law, worship and betrayal, it plays havoc with moral ambiguities."
1,"I first saw it when I was 14 and thought it was one of the worst pictures ever -- garish, oppressive, and appallingly overacted. Grown up, I'd go with those same adjectives, except now I think it's one of the best."
1,"Indeed, just to see and hear the extraordinary 3 minute and 20 second opening sequence -- a fluid tour de force tracking shot -- without impediment of opening credits and street-sound-masking movie score is accomplishment enough."
1,"Expressionistic in the extreme, filled with shadows, angles and cinematic flourishes, the film raises the usual brooding nightmare ambiance of film noir to a level few other pictures have attempted."
1,"Having the Touch of Evil envisioned by our most creative filmmaker, is a wondrous gift no movie lover should miss."
1,[Welles'] scenes with brothel-keeper Marlene Dietrich have nothing to do with the plot and everything to do with the rotting heart of this amazing fable: the apotheosis of pulp.
1,The bravura of the opening sequence of Orson Welles's last Hollywood picture grabs you by the throat.
1,"Adapted by Welles from Whit Masterson's pulp thriller Badge of Evil, it had streaks of teen degradation and reefer madness, and the most intense interracial relationship since The Searchers."
1,"Like the bomb that's lobbed in the boot of the soft-top car in its opening scene, Touch Of Evil is a film where we can hear the faint sound of ticking in our heads, but don't realise what the problem is before it's far too late."
1,It is typical of Orson Welles that he takes a B-movie thriller set on the Mexican border and gives it a Shakespearian grandeur.
1,"Made in 1958, it was Orson Welles's last Hollywood film, and in it he makes transcendent use of the American technology his genius throve on; never again would his resources be so rich or his imagination so fiendishly baroque."
1,"Citizen Kane may be the more weighty, rounded work, but Touch of Evil is a heap more fun."
0,"Most of the jokes, though, depend on a ""Rip Van Winkle"" notion -- the duo is surprised by how the world has changed -- which would make more sense if prisoners hadn't had windows to the outside world, such as television."
0,"Tough Guys might have been better if Douglas and Lancaster had played characters who were a little more fallible, humble and realistic."
1,"The more Joseph tries to understand, the more impenetrable it becomes."
1,"Above all a visual achievement, an exuberant use of camera placement and movement and inventive lighting."
1,"The Trial is splendid to look at and teeming with ideas about the individual, society, and of course, film itself."
0,"At best, it is another demonstration of the camera vers atility of Mr. Welles; at worse, a further Kafka demonstration extending to the demanding medium of the screen."
1,The blackest of Welles' comedies.
1,"Though debatable as an adaptation of the Franz Kafka novel, Orson Welles's nightmarish, labyrinthine comedy of 1962 remains his creepiest and most disturbing work; it's also a lot more influential than people usually admit."
1,"Who better to reveal the system's evil genius than Welles, the golden boy turned Hollywood martyr?"
1,"Perkins gives one of the best performances of his career in The Trial, aided by an outstanding array of stellar players."
0,"Roger Corman and Peter Fonda, trying to do for LSD what they did for motorcycles in The Wild Angels. It doesn't take."
0,"[Fonda] takes a trip with no retribution at all: no death, no disillusionment, but much bikinied girls on sea shores, swirling psychedelia, and mumbling of 'Wow!' by the obligatory Dennis Hopper in the land of a thousand visual clich챕s."
0,"In trying to visualize a notion of what Peter Fonda goes through on an LSD trip, Roger Corman has simply resorted to a long succession of familiar cinematic images, accompanied by weird music and sounds."
0,Unconnected scenes begin to spin off the screen with increasing speed and with no attempt at explanation.
0,"The Trip is a psychedelic tour through the bent mind of Peter Fonda, which is evidently full of old movies."
1,"Wisely, the writers and director, Mr. King, have husbanded the potential of an illustrated mission for one big concentrated punch, and they have got into this major sequence great excitement and reality."
1,One of Peck's best performances.
1,"As a drama, High deals soundly and interestingly with its situations."
0,"Sincere, square, and interminable."
1,It is one of the best treatments of World War II. but not without its defects. These include its length and some of the old war picture cliches. But the acting (especially Peck) and direction approach greatness.
1,It is an engaging entertainment with some big laughs and a sort of warm goofiness.
1,There's enough sugary male bonding to warrant a Sensitive Guys Red Alert.
0,[Twins] is the sort of movie that seems to be made of Styrofoam. It's instantly disposable but it won't quickly disappear.
1,"DeVito displays his remarkable ability to shift from fast-talking cynicism to affecting sentiment, while Arnie reveals a reasonable talent for light comedy."
1,"Director Ivan Reitman more than delivers on the wacky promise of Twins in this nutty, storybook tale of siblings separated at birth and reunited at age 35."
0,"For all of its geniality and gushing good will, Ivan Reitman`s ''Twins'' remains an advertising campaign in search of a movie."
1,"The whole movie has a warmth about it that never slops over into sentiment: there is much more here than tall-guy, short-guy jokes."
1,"But what's surprising is that Twins is somewhat sweeter than might have been expected. The mechanical plot may shake and grind unpleasantly, but gentler sounds also are produced."
0,"""Twins"" starts with an overblown fairy-tale quality that seems as if it should work. But, by the finish, the movie collapses on the shoulders of the stars. It works because they both showed up and delivered the goods and kept their end of the deal."
1,Schwarzenegger is amusing as a fish out of water in a land full of sharks.
0,The basic idea of Uncommon Valor is so interesting that it's all they can do to make a routine formula movie out of it. But they do.
0,"Unfortunately, McLaglen is never able to draw his threads together. As in his The Way West, he takes a panoramic theme and then gets so close to it that we lose sight of the whole."
0,
1,"Not much liked at the time, but a small masterpiece just the same in its skilful blending of moods, genuinely moving and quite beautifully played by Harrison and Darnell."
1,It is too bad that Preston Sturges is not compelled by law to turn out at least one movie -- maybe two -- a year. For nobody makes films as he does.
1,No director ever matched Preston Sturges's way of blending low slapstick and literate dialogue comedy.
1,One of the most sophisticated slapstick comedies ever made.
1,"Director Martha Coolidge turned a short-lived fad into a genuine sleeper, an exploitation film that thoroughly transcends its origins to become a highly appealing romantic comedy."
0,"With characters as dimensionless as these, the film needs either greater irony or greater sympathy than it demonstrates."
1,"This movie is a little treasure, a funny, sexy, appealing story of a Valley Girl's heartbreaking decision: Should she stick with her boring jock boyfriend, or take a chance on a punk from Hollywood?"
1,"For a change, there aren't any cartoon problem adults on hand as there often are in these pictures."
0,
1,"Vice Versa is a treasure of a movie, in which the performances hold the key. It's a movie that finds its humor in many small moments of truth and accurate observation"
0,Unsatisfactory both for fans of star-studded prison escape dramas and for football fans hoping to see cunningly devised tactics from Pele and his squad of internationals.
1,"The form of the film is conventional, but the manner in which it has been executed is not."
1,"A frankly oldfashioned World War II morality play, hinging on soccer as a civilized metaphor for the game of War."
1,"The atmosphere and pace are superbly handled, and the performances of the sinister, inhumanly intelligent 'children' never falter."
1,A strong and subtle horror film from England.
0,This just tapers off from a taut beginning into soggy melodrama.
1,Village is one of the neatest little horror pictures produced since Peter Lorre went straight.
1,
0,"If the movie is not as dangerous as its detractors claim, neither is it as glorious and memorable as some of its less discriminating admirers would have it."
0,"It's both surrealistic pop art and sentimentalized pandering to the attitude of ""us against them,"" the have-nots against the haves."
1,"There's a night-blooming, psychedelic shine to the whole baroque movie."
0,"A British satire of political muddle in Caribbean island, Water is a frenetic mishmash."
0,"Lacking a footing in the real world, the show never strikes it rich."
0,"At least, as the harassed governor, Michael Caine displays his customary practised ease; Caine could do this sort of thing standing on his head, and on this occasion might have."
0,How on earth do films like this make the mighty leap from drawing board to movie camera -- and then from camera to audience?
0,A comedy with the zing of its title.
0,"As an attempt at mad-cap political satire, Dick Clement's Water is really surprisingly wet considering it boasts such useful people in the cast."
1,"I've rarely seen a location used more effectively than in We're No Angels, where the small town of Mission in British Columbia has been dressed up to match the Depression era."

1,Weird Science combines two great traditions in popular entertainment: Inflamed male teenage fantasies and Frankenstein's monster.
0,Even 14-year-old boys may find it heavy sledding.
0,This is ordinary stuff that's aged about as well as Mitchell-Smith's clunky computer.
0,Weird Science veers off into a typical coming-of-age saga without exploring any of the psychological territory it lightly sails over in the early going.
0,"The movie is the latest in the ""Wouldn't it be neat if . . .?"" school of movies."
0,"Although Walton contrives to keep most of his contrivances on the safe side of absurdity, ""Stranger"" is at best a close call."
1,"To appreciate just how different it is from the other entries in this then still nascent subgenre [the slasher], we need to move on from its opening to its more critically neglected middle section."
1,"To be honest, it couldn't go wrong."
0,Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn't hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force.
1,"Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, along with VistaVision, keep the enteratinment going in this fancifully staged production, clicking well."
0,The whole thing is rather forced and antiseptically cheerful.
1,"Paramount's first film in (lavender-hued) VistaVision was this pornographically soppy but, nonetheless, hearty and humorous 1954 festive romp."
1,White Christmas is the cinema equivalent of an inappropriate festive snog under the mistletoe -- you know you probably shouldn't enjoy it but you just can't help yourself.
1,"It's a nice, if undemanding, Yuletide treat."
1,A new score by Irving Berlin also contributed to its marzipan popularity. But it's the title song that really produced lasting gold. That and the fake snow.
1,A good musical with a lot of star power.
0,"A big fat yam of a picture richly candied with VistaVision (Paramount's answer to CinemaScope), Technicolor, tunes by Irving Berlin, massive production numbers, and big stars. Unfortunately, the yam is still a yam."
0,"What is it in this film that touches some deep-buried nerve in the public psyche? Why does wholesome family entertainment fade away, while rats make millions?"
0,"The movie, however, persists in crossing its lines of stimulation, resulting in a series of little short-circuits that effectively limit pleasure to an occasional line or bit of business."
1,"The final shoot-out remains a classic study in mise-en-scene, as Mann transforms a jagged landscape into a highly charged psychological battleground."
1,"A frisky, fast-moving, funny Western in which a rifle is the apple of a cowboy's eye."
1,"Mann's first film with James Stewart, with whom he was to make a series of classic Westerns, this offers the clearest example of Mann's use of the revenge plot."
1,"Stewart brings real flavor and appeal to the role of Lin, in a lean, concentrated portrayal."
1,"Strikingly photographed in black & white, the film is directed with an eye to realistic detail, an ear for the script's frequently natural dialogue and a knack for building suspense."
1,"Winchester '73 changed the way cinema audiences saw the Western, because it featured a more complex idea of the noble hero of the west -- a man plagued by personal problems and violent impulses."
0,"It's pretty to look at and it contains a number of good performances, but there is something exhausting about its neat balancing of opposing manners and values."
1,Harrison Ford has never given a better performance in a movie.
1,"Powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and thankfully devoid of easy moralising, it also offers a performance of surprising skill and sensitivity from Ford."
1,"A lot of care and attention has gone into both the Oscar-winning screenplay and the beautiful cinematography, to create a powerful and romantic story."
1,Playing John Book allowed viewers the opportunity to see Ford the actor instead of Ford the action/adventure icon. It is one of the few times he has been given the opportunity to play in a straight drama.
1,"Witness warms up as the attraction builds between Ford, McGillis and Haas -- all performing excellently through this portion."
0,"Weir, an Australian filming in this country for the first time, has succumbed to blandness."
1,"A moderately effective, highly affected thriller."
1,"What saves ""Witness"" is its cast, and Weir's artistry in orchestrating and modulating their performances."
1,... striking thriller.
1,"A more eccentric film than the following year's The Philadelphia Story, with which it shares a couple of faces, it's almost as fabulous."
0,Picture however holds passages that slow movement down to a walk.
1,A film that deserves to be seen (or seen again).
1,The catty banter and Wildean aphorisms (some of them contributed by Anita Loos) are delivered with impeccable timing by a cast only MGM could have mustered.
1,"[Cukor is] at his best with a cast that includes Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Hedda Hopper, Ruth Hussey, Paulette Goddard, and Joan Fontaine."
1,"Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell are a few among many of those purring, silken, clawing females so cleverly and mercilessly fashioned."
1,Directing ensemble scenes with upwards of half a dozen divas is no easy feat - leave it to Cukor to corral this kind of star power into a two hour-+ film that never takes a break to powder its nose.
1,It's exhilaratingly funny.
0,"Frighteningly authentic, the story generates only a modicum of drama."
1,"Hitchcock's ultimate point evokes cosmic terror: innocence is merely a trick of paperwork, whereas guilt is the human condition."
1,Emily Bronte's novel tells a haunting tale of love and tragedy. Samuel Goldwyn's film version retains all of the grim drama of the book. It's heavy fare throughout.
0,... the movie ends up looking cluttered.
1,The bottom line: Year of the Dragon is a first-rate cops vs the mob melodrama that restores Michael Cimino's reputation as a gifted filmmaker.
1,"As a genuinely amusing family film, it will do nicely."
0,"A leering, uncertain, embarrassing, protracted little comedy-neatly divided into television inter-commercial periods, each terminated by an abysmal, inevitable joke-quite anti sex and pro compulsive procreation."
0,"A mean and unsavory celebration of misplaced misogyny milked for dollars, a mindless soup of urban neurosis and sexual loathing."
1,"The plot is a little of ""Fatal Attraction,"" a little of ""Jagged Edge"" and a little of ""Wall Street."" It works because it's so audacious in combining elements that don't seem to belong together."
0,"What starts out as a moody arthouse flick rapidly becomes an uneven B-movie yukfest (sometimes intentional, sometimes not), with low-budget concessions to the Hollywood cop-versus-killer industry."
1,Jamie Lee Curtis makes Megan so appealing and real that the film holds together even when it has no reason to.
1,"Short on plausibility but preserving the psycho-sexual ambiguities throughout, Bigelow's seductively stylish, wildy fetishistic thriller is proof that a woman can enter a traditionally male world and, like Megan, beat men at their own game."
1,"Blue Steel turns into yet another movie about Jamie Lee Curtis bravely fighting off a bogeyman. It's Halloween 1990. Still, Bigelow's talent cuts through in flashes."
0,Am I crazy in not seeing this as a New York story?
0,"Of the many threats to modern man documented in horror films -- the slashers, the haunters, the body snatchers -- the most innocent would seem to be the druids."
1,"The best thing about ""Mystery Train"" is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look."
1,"Certainly Jarmusch brings back his favorite predilections (and probably always will), but he makes his passengers interesting, kicks the plot off the platform whenever possible and keeps the way ahead refreshingly uncertain."
0,"If there is a rationale for what takes place on-screen, it's not evident. Things happen, and nothing means anything."
1,It's the best thing Mr. Jarmusch has done to date.
1,"Happily, Jarmusch's formal inventiveness is framed by a rare flair for zany entertainment ..."
1,"The three-part structure of Mystery Train is still a bit shambling and slight, but there's an undeniable air of deadpan cool that permeates the film and gives it a haunting sense of place."
0,"It's also a mess, but one that's so giddily misguided that it's sometimes a good deal of fun for all of the wrong reasons."
0,An almost inconceivable disaster.
0,Watching Revolution is a little like visiting a museum -- it looks good without really being alive.
0,"What's lacking in this heartfelt, well-researched, sporadically interesting movie is a master plan."
0,"Either as unintentional parody or truncated epic, you can start this Revolution without me."
0,"[A] solemn, incoherent, brown film."
1,Everything about this remarkable production is exhilaratingly unexpected.
1,"More questioning, more agonized, finally more humble."
1,What works best in the film is the over-all vision.
1,"In this alert, rousing interpretation of Henry V, Branagh beats down the doors of high art and drags the sleeping bard into the light of modern day."
1,Mr. Branagh's Henry has psychological heft and intellectual weight.
1,"Branagh succeeds in his blunt, robust portrayal of the Soldier-King, hauling the film along in the wake of his own gung-ho performance."
1,"A stirring, gritty and enjoyable pic which offers a plethora of fine performances from some of the U.K.'s brightest talents."
1,"The cast -- including Derek Jacobi as the modern-dress chorus, Paul Scofield, Judi Dench, Ian Holm, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane in an effective cameo as Falstaff -- is uniformly fine without any grandstanding."
1,"There is a great deal of value in Branagh`s version, not least in his own lead performance as a soft, indefinite Henry who defines himself over the course of the play."
1,"If Olivier gave us the glint of sunlight on armor and the wind roaring through the pennants and flags, Branagh gives us the rot, the mold, the wounds and the crusted blood underneath."
1,"Branagh has made a hotblooded, lively and moving Henry V that speaks pertinently to a new generation."
0,"The film is efficient enough, but it's a measure of Hathaway's limitations that it never once fulfills the paranoid delirium built into its subject."
1,"It is ... something new and welcome in U.S. crime movies. None of its criminals is glamorous, nor does anyone piously point out that crime does not pay. Nobody has to. The whole picture amply demonstrates the fact."
1,Major credit goes to Clarence Brown for direction.
1,"If you are not too particular about the images of Carroll and Tenniel, if you are high on Disney whimsey and if you'll take a somewhat slow, uneven pace, you should find this picture entertaining."
1,"Walt Disney has gone a long way towards tightening the leisurely, haphazard adventure of Alice in the wonderland of her imagination."
0,What's really disappointing is the undistinguished animation: the film looks and plays more like the Disney shorts than the Disney features.
1,"Disney's frantic take on Lewis Carroll may lack much of the book's illogical charm, but it does contain one of the great proto-psychedelic sequences in cinema."
1,"Carroll's dream logic seems to liberate the animators: everything is constantly transforming, including prim Alice herself."
1,"Alice In Wonderland is one of Walt Disney's best efforts. He has adhered to the Lewis Carrol classic, adding enough Disney humor to make it a delight for all ages."

0,"Dick Tracy is Batman in a fedora -- a much-ballyhooed cartoon noir that's as skimpy on substance as it is burgeoning with jujube-colored, jutt-jawed style."
0,"Tracy is Tinseltown's annual celebration of everything that's wrong with itself: the hype, the agent-negotiated star system, the Hollywood 'fun' assembly-line method of copy-cat mediocrity, etc."
1,"This is a movie in which every frame contains some kind of artificial effect. An entire world has been built here, away from the daylight and the realism of ordinary city streets."
0,"For all its superficial pleasures, Dick Tracy ultimately flounders because it provides an audience with nothing to take home and dream about."
1,"Summer hasn't officially arrived yet, but it's unlikely to offer a big-budget commercial movie as thoroughly entertaining as this stylish real-life cartoon."
1,A spectacular movie whose technical achievements -- notably the sharp editing -- will surely provide a gauge by which subsequent comic strip films are judged.
0,"This has an appealing two-dimensional comic-book look, but lacks the vision to go with it, not to mention an interesting hero or a feeling for action."
1,Forget the hype. Now for the real question: How's the damn movie? Answer: Pretty darn swell.
0,"Though it looks ravishing, Warren Beatty's longtime pet project is a curiously remote, uninvolving film."
0,The film moves at a chug when it should put the pedal to the floor.
1,Beatty and his team of collaborators have heightened the vibrantly tawdry urban night world of Chester Gould's classic comic strip.
1,"Forget the plot. The essence of Dick Tracy lies in characters and style, and there it exceeds last summer's clunky, over-produced Batman."
1,A visual delight and a dramatic letdown.

1,Nifty performances make this routine action flick better than it probably has a right to be.
0,It's the dullest action movie since The Green Berets.
0,"Unfortunately, [Teague is] working from a cliche-choked, insensitive script."
0,"Director Teague does stage the action sequences with logic and clarity, though there isn`t much he can do with the dramatic passages."
0,The movie is full of macho swagger and unabashed hero-worship.
1,Navy Seals stands out among this summer's violence-oriented pictures as the only one that doesn't leave your brain feeling like mashed potatoes.
0,It's difficult to accept these trained SEALs as anything more than a species of Dirty Dozen.
1,"Even at its worst, Chips is inoffensive in its sentimentality. At its best, it's the first film since The Two of Us that I genuinely feel deserves to be called heartwarming."

0,No comic bite -- and precious little bark.
0,How is it possible that actors as expert as Close and Depardieu can wind up together in a mostly brainless big-budget stinker?
0,"The whole movie is overbright, overloud, antic, telling us the characters and animals are endearing rather than allowing them to reveal themselves as such."
0,Guess which filmmakers didn't have the smarts to license 'Who Let the Dogs Out'?
0,The sequel adds more insults and injuries that could traumatize little ones.

1,"The actors succeed quite nicely in unifying the movie's multiple personalities, its ricocheting screenplay."
0,"Contains some nice ideas, and occasionally, for whole moments at a time, succeeds in evoking the mysteries that it toys with."
1,Surprisingly entertaining.
0,"Zucker dutifully pushes all the buttons -- romance, thrills, laughs, tears -- that have been pushed before by more assured hands."
0,"Ghost' is too slow moving at times, and a few of its special effects look incongruously silly, particularly those showing what happens to ghosts not as virtuous as Sam."
1,"The real credit for turning a minor mystic romance into one of the most enjoyable movies of the year rests on an excellent script by Bruce Joel Rubin, and on the surprisingly sure direction of Jerry Zucker."
1,"A comedy, romance and supernatural thriller rolled into one, Ghost is a zippy pastiche that somehow manages to seem fresh even though it's built entirely out of borrowed parts."
1,"Ghost is an odd creation -- at times nearly smothering in arty somberness, at others veering into good, wacky fun."
1,Ghost is a dazzlingly enjoyable pop thriller.
0,"The movie's slogan is ""Believe,"" not an unreasonable request. But even those who'd be happy to comply must get past Ghost's one casting jaw-dropper, a certain woolly-mindedness to its script and a production prettified to the point of stickiness."
1,"What it offers, apart from the overblown special effects that seem inescapable in American movies, is an unusual and effective combination of swooning, morbid romance and screwball comedy."
1,The passion and poignancy of trying to communicate with the dead is well-exploited here. Moore has never been more fetching.
1,"Given its obviously commercial aims, Ghost is remarkably appealing on a purely personal level. It is about how you deal with death."
1,"Ghost is one part horror picture, one part comedy, one part love story, one part murder mystery and four parts entrancing."
0,A bad movie that a lot of people will like.
0,There's something offensive about the movie's chintzy view of death and the way it periodically flirts with promising conceits only to back away from them in as cowardly a manner as possible.
0,"It sounds like a horror movie, but it's a romantic fairy tale. The scariest thing about it is its shamelessness."
1,Rubin's script is a lethally effective tragicomic fantasy.

0,What Top Gun might have looked like if it were drawn with crayons.
1,"This human element in the experience of the Memphis Belle crew somehow compensates for a lack of human dimension in the characters. We can't really tell the crew members apart, and don't much care to, but we can identify with them."
0,"The direction by Michael Caton-Jones' is undistinguished here, but the material is not great."
1,"Sensitive, gripping, oddly old-fashioned cinema."
0,Unashamedly commercial. Its moral fabric is thinner than that of other David Puttnam productions.
1,
1,Still a classic example of eye-popping excess at a time when German filmmakers were among the most innovative in the world.
1,"I sometimes feel, in this age of expert CGI, that I am being shown too much -- that technique is pushing aside artistry and imagination. The world of Faust is never intended to define a physical universe, but is a landscape of nightmares."
0,Murnau's version of the story of the man who sold his soul to the Devil (Jannings) in return for youth is visually extraordinary but dismally uneven in terms of its dramatic effect.
1,Here is a picture which is as far removed from the ordinary movie as a Tintoretto painting.
1,"This extraordinary piece of artistry and craftsmanship integrates its dazzling special effects so seamlessly that they're indistinguishable from the film's narrative, poetry, and, above all, metaphysics."
1,As atmospheric and menacing a work as the expressionist movement ever produced.
1,It can be said without exaggeration that each individual scene in this production is in itself a perfect picture.
1,From the standpoint of taste and photographic brilliance it Is doubtful whether there has ever been a production that surpassed it.
1,"If we do not trouble our heads about the Faust legend or about consistency in the interpretation of it, the film, considered as a succession of swift, brilliant scenes, is a good one."
1,"From the ever-serviceable Faust story is derived a weird fairytale, a picture story of the powers of evil on earth."
1,"Gun Crazy' is a magnificently enjoyable film, distinguished by Joseph H Lewis's restless, catch-all directorial style."
1,"Admittedly, the script is vintage corn. But visually Gun Crazy is a rude, startling and suggestive pleasure."
1,"this is a small but perfectly formed black-and-white masterpiece of flash and trash, unwholesome obsession and criminal daring."
1,"Nearly 20 years before the same themes powered Bonnie and Clyde, Lewis was on to the possibilities of ""outsider"" cinema, and his film is all the more subversive for its origins as raw pulp, unpoliced by the Hollywood system, and getting away with murder."
1,"A major influence on both Bonnie and Clyde and the French New Wave (with Godard a particular admirer), it's a film that far transcends its low budget constraints."
1,"Like all great films noirs, this 1949 lovers-on-the-run thriller, directed by cultists' darling Joseph H. Lewis (The Big Combo), is lean, mean and delirious."
1,"This modest-looking B-movie, first seen in 1949, has acquired a substantial following in the years since - justifiably."
0,"Fault is in the writing and direction, both staying on the surface and never getting underneath the characters."
1,One of the most distinguished works of art to emerge from the B movie swamp.
1,"The already-classic trope of lovers on the run, 횪 la Bonnie and Clyde, gets a stylish workout from the director Joseph H. Lewis."
1,"It's also got great knockabout visual gags, mercifully little cutey-poo sentiment, and reasonable songs."
0,"A serious disappointment, recommended only for inveterate Disney fans and very young people."
1,"The standout song goes to Harris, a rhythmic 'Bare Necessities' extolling the value of a simple life and credited to Terry Gilkyson."
1,"The result is thoroughly delightful. The reasons for its success lie in Disney's own unfettered animal spirits, his ability to be childlike without being childish."
1,"Smple, uncluttered, straight-forward fun."
1,Elliott Gould in the lead seems to relish the joke of serving up Marlowe in a radically different way.
1,[Altman] attempts the impossible and pulls it off.
1,"The Long Goodbye attacks film noir with three of his most cherished tools: Whimsy, spontaneity and narrative perversity."
1,"Despite cries of outrage from hard-line Chandler purists, this is, along with Hawks' The Big Sleep, easily the most intelligent of all screen adaptations of the writer's work."
0,"An uneven mixture of insider satire on the gumshow film genre, gratuitous brutality, and sledgehammer whimsy."
1,The Long Goodbye is a gloriously inspired tribute to Hollywood that never loses sight of what Los Angeles has become.
1,"Raymond Chandler's sentimental foolishness is the taking-off place for Robert Altman's heady, whirling sideshow of a movie, set in the early-seventies L.A. of the stoned sensibility."
1,"A masterpiece of sorts, it digs beneath the surface of the supposedly liberated spirit of the times to expose the ethos that took America into the Vietnam war and produced Watergate."
1,The film is so inventive in its situations and humor that its shortcomings - the blunt ideas at its core - don't become apparent before several viewings.

1,
1,The understated passion of The Long Walk Home sneaks up on your emotions.
1,"The second in the popular series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations made by the enterprising mini-studio American International Pictures, this Roger Corman picture is carpeted wall-to-wall with luxuriant gothic excess."
1,No finer film has ever been made about organized crime.
1,It is not a coincidence that Scorsese's three masterpieces all star Robert De Niro.
1,"GoodFellas is an appalling masterpiece of the kind that, along with New York's current well-publicized troubles, is likely to give pause to anyone planning to make a trip to the city."
1,"The performances by everyone are stunning, standout."
1,Goodfellas is a tour de force that brilliantly evokes both the seductive glamour and moral degradation of organised crime.
1,Goodfellas looks and sounds as if it must be absolutely authentic.
1,"Scorsese's fast, violent, stylish mobster movie is a return to form."
0,Colorful but dramatically unsatisfying.
1,May well be the most accomplished thing Scorsese's ever done.
1,"You walk away, tantalized by a view into the darkest part of yourself, glad that that part is still behind bars."
1,"In GoodFellas, director Martin Scorsese does something simple and audacious: He takes the guilt out of organized crime."
1,"All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. GoodFellas is easily one of the year`s best films."
1,"GoodFellas, which somehow mixes its horrors with a deep vein of mordant humor, flows with the exuberance of a filmmaker who has every detail nailed and a few new lovely moves he wants to show us."
1,"Spanning thirty years and running two and a half hours, the film bristles with the violent passion, howitzer wit and virtuoso style that made Scorsese's reputation with the gangster drama Mean Streets in 1973."
1,"In GoodFellas, Scorsese, that connoisseur of mean streets and brutish, reflexive rage, has fashioned a stunning film that belongs on the same lonely, top shelf as Coppola's Mafia saga."
1,"Robert De Niro gives what has come to be a typical Robert De Niro performance -- understated, sly, ingratiating. Joe Pesci, as the hot-tempered Tommy, steals several scenes from his fellow performers."
1,"The most profoundly Catholic of contemporary filmmakers, Scorsese has here imagined a world without the slightest notion of sin-everything is permitted, and he is both fascinated and appalled by the total freedom of his characters."
1,"Definitive, sky-high Scorsese, and the one towards which all his subsequent films have been reaching, Goodfellas is, put bluntly, the best movie of the director's career."
1,"One remains detached from the characters, but Scorsese succeeds in smashing all the foolishly romantic myths about the mob with this shocking, vigorously honest portrait of a slick yuppie gangster who couldn't stand being ""an average nobody."""
1,"Sure, it's a rush - but is that enough?"
1,It hasn't aged in the slightest.
1,Brash and brilliant ...
1,"Goodfellas is remorseless, its message terminally bleak."
1,"Goodfellas is a terrifying film because, like much of Scorsese's best work, it is about the lives of avuncular psychopaths, and pretty-boy Liotta brilliantly encapsulates that fetid contradiction."
0,"Robert De Niro is reliably dynamic, and Joe Pesci's portrait of a gangster with a sense of humour is hideously memorable, but there's no doubt that GoodFellas fights a losing battle against numbness."
1,"Anti-romantic, it nevertheless sweeps us into the allure of mob glamour -- then slams us with its cost of admission."
1,Is it a great movie? I don't think so. But it's a triumphant piece of filmmaking-journalism presented with the brio of drama.
1,"Complex, volatile, ironic and disquieting, Scorsese's Goodfellas is a masterly achievement in intense observation."
1,This is the work of a master filmmaker who controls his effects so skillfully that I was drained by this film.
1,After Hours is like one of those stories about a driver from out of town who takes the wrong turnoff on a big city expressway and winds up having an awful but memorable story to tell the folks back home... as long as he survives.
1,"After Hours is not, ultimately, a satisfying film, but it's often vigorously unsettling. In this season of homogenized pap, that should be read as praise."
1,Inventive film-making of the first order.
0,Anxiety-ridden picture would have been pretty funny if it didn't play like a confirmation of everyone's worst fears about contemporary urban life.
1,"Scorsese's orchestration of thematic development, narrative structure, and visual style is stunning in its detail and fullness; this 1985 feature reestablished him as one of the very few contemporary masters of filmmaking."
1,"The result is a delirious and challenging comedy, a postmodern Ulysses in Nighttown."
1,"After Hours is dazzling movie making; you could get a giddy kick just from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus' shot as a set of house keys floats down toward the camera, tossed from a top-floor apartment."
1,"Like many of Scorsese's earlier pictures, After Hours has a fascination with the bizarre. But the new film is lighter in spirit than any Scorsese film, with the possible exception of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
1,"It's his most-un-Scorsese-like film, and it's an overlooked gem."
0,"That ""After Hours"" fails to satisfy, that it derails, that even its own director tires of the material halfway through, would disappoint no one if the name of Martin Scorsese didn't appear above the title."
1,"It might not make any sense. It might not even matter. But it's a blast while it lasts, and it brings the most perfect of endings along with the sunrise."

1,"The movie is magnificently photographed on location. The performances are authentic and understated, and Brandauer makes a convincing veteran prospector, part hard-bitten, part dreamer."
1,"Though slow and overlong, the movie is at least scenic family fare."
1,A scenic and enveloping nature film about a young man and his beloved pet.
0,"Despite moments of bravura and shameless tugs at the heart-strings, the film simply meanders towards a resolution. What's Brandauer doing here?"
1,Boasts enough nature footage and a strong central performance by Ethan Hawke to win over small fry
0,
1,"Ecstatic cinema and ecstatic living join together in a pressurized promise of glory and misery, a flameout waiting to happen-and to be filmed."
1,A debut feature of extraordinary passion and vigor.
1,The director's slight uncertainty creates a fascinating tension that works in Boy Meets Girl's favor. You empathize with the characters' struggles even as they are both kept at a critical distance.
0,Greta Garbo tries to wheedle secrets out of Ramon Navarro and Lewis Stone in her most ludicrous film.
1,A glamourous and romantic conception of the latter days of the life of the Dutch dancer and courtesan who was shot as a spy by the French in 1917.
1,"The film is Garbo's even before she appears on screen to dazzle her willing audience; once there, it becomes impossible to dissociate the legend of the star from the myth of Mata Hari."
0,"Though Garbo is sexy and hot in a less subtle way this time, and though the plot goes about as far as it can in situation warmth, the story presents nothing sensational."

1,"Its own terms and for much of the way, this is a superior thriller."
1,Ken Loach's Hidden Agenda must be the most buttoned-down movie about a conspiracy theory ever made.
1,This quietly explosive film comes to resonate more loudly than melodrama.
1,"There's plenty of evidence of Loach's undiminished power as a film-maker, and equally ample evidence that something is very rotten in the state of Northern Ireland."
0,"Though it attempts to make an acceptable theatrical entertainment out of a complex political saga, Hidden Agenda lacks bigscreen impact."
1,"The film retains the same beatnik wit that the play effectively distilled, as well as a few scary shocks."
0,There is little about it to warrant the clamorous interest of the average moviegoer or to distinguish it as a significant piece of cinematic art.
1,"Some creaky business with a Salvation Army sister recalls the piece's stage origins, but the music and the sense of 'dead time' retain a 'beat' authenticity."
1,[Clarke] gets at the inner truth of addicts - that they're pining for transcendence in the void.
1,"A lean, mean saga of jazz, junk and rebellion."
1,"The quartet of musicians, led by the pianist and composer Freddie Redd and the caustic-toned post-bop saxophonist Jackie McLean, perform brilliantly on-camera as they dramatize both the agonized wait and the needed high."
1,"With so much to offer, the picture can be excused from the duties of entertainment in the pleasurable sense."
0,"Perhaps if you have a special interest in foul folks and morbidities, you will thrill to this Hal Wallis picture. Frankly, we squirmed -- and not from dread."
1,Stanwyck's metamorphosis from indolence to hysteria is brilliantly executed.
1,Number derives sleek hysteria from its audaciously constraining narrative strategy.

1,"With a deliciously curvy and complex plot, Diabolique is a masterpiece of suspense -- as accomplished as anything done by Hitchcock."
1,[Creates] a diabolical double-reverse plot that keeps the audience guessing right up to the thoroughly implausible final scene.
1,This is one of the dandiest mystery dramas that has shown here in goodness knows when.
1,A great piece of Guignol misanthropy.
0,"Although this has a few hallucinating bits of terror, the film is primarily a creaky-door type of melodrama."
1,"Cruel, sour, and -- unfortunately -- very effective."

1,"Still riveting stuff, beautifully acted out by Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot, the director's wife."

0,"I suppose that never forgetting has its place, but not when it insists on such narrowly righteous fantasies of revenge."
1,"Come and See, the last and most notable film made by the former Soviet director Elem Klimov, is another fusion of popular and vanguard styles, albeit put to more civic-minded use."
1,I have rarely seen a film more ruthless in its depiction of human evil.
1,"""Come and See"" is a paradox: a visceral freefall into barbarism, but also a controlled, sometimes contemplative descent."
0,The Miracle has so much poetic-nattering-by-the-Irish-seaside that the movie keeps drifting into the stratosphere. Jordan should come back down to earth. He does much better there.
0,"The Miracle opens with small enchantments and a warmth of feeling, and then at around the midway point gets bogged down in miscalculations that are finally fatal."
1,"Shot with startling dream sequences, punctuated by surreal circus imagery, propelled by Anne Dudley's sublimely moody score, The Miracle creates a world charged with youthful romanticism yet tempered by the comic tranquillity of recollection."

1,An intelligent look at a time when the old guard of tough-talking gumshoes and snappy reporters were about to surrender to a new breed: educated and self-aware men and women.
0,"The movie is finally so ridiculous it cannot be taken seriously as a thriller or anything else, but there are moments that work, and you'll love the look on the hero's face when he discovers the identity of the dead body."

1,"In the wrong hands, this material could have been simply a cautionary tale, but Hurt and his director, Randa Haines, who also collaborated on Children of a Lesser God, make it into the story of a specific, flawed, fascinating human being."

1,The Doctor is that rare specimen--a big studio movie that treats the audience (and its own characters) with intelligence and respect. It cuts close to the bone.

1,"Alan Parker's sexy, hilarious, exuberantly energetic new film, The Commitments, has so much rhythmic juice that it's nearly impossible to stay in your seat."
1,"As music and human comedy, it works just fine."
1,"The musical numbers, actually performed by the on-screen band, are sensational."
0,"Parker keeps going for the glitz. He may have shot The Commitments in Ireland, but his soul never left Hollywood."
1,"Mr. Parker is capable of whipping a series of quick, well-edited snippets into a happy collage of musical high spirits."
1,"Foul-mouthed, fast-talking and very funny, this is Parker's best to date."
1,"Director Alan Parker's story of a band of young Dubliners playing American '60s soul is fresh, well-executed and original."
1,"This is probably Alan Parker's best film, in part because it's one of his most modest."
1,"The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies."

0,"Director Garry Marshall delivers a barrage of endearing confrontations, bedroom confessions and wacky supporting characters. But the central affair is a soulless nothing."

0,But even this dose of healthy cynicism cannot stay the movie's case of incurable romanticism.
1,"""Frankie and Johnny"" has been reshaped into foolproof schmaltz. ""Foolproof"" is the operative word."
0,Marshall directs as if Marty had never happened.
0,"Frankie and Johnny is an all-star, high-gloss, feel-good romantic feature sitcom."
1,"The movie is mature enough to understand that love, contrary to our starry-eyed fantasies, often demands a spark of will - that at some point you have to leave your cloister behind and say that, yes, this is the person I'm going to take a chance on."
0,But this is more than just an irritating movie; it's a disappointing one.
1,"Our Flick of the Week is ''Frankie & Johnny,'' which manages to work as a sudsy romantic picture about big city loneliness despite an awkward performance by Al Pacino in the role of a hash-house dispenser of wisdom."
1,"Chances are you'll have a good time with ""Frankie & Johnny,"" but you won't respect yourself in the morning. It's that kind of movie."
1,
0,"Deceived opens with an ancient thriller formula, elevates itself to passages of genuine suspense, and then ends with a climax so absurd that it takes a real effort of memory to recall that parts of the movie were really pretty good."
1,"Given these fundamental caveats, Deceived is diverting, if disposable, fun. Director Damian Harris knows how to keep an audience's attention."

1,The Star is a wonderful tour de force for Bette Davis.
1,"What's truly revolutionary about this filmmaker -- his perverse, ironic humanity -- is only intermittently on display in this quasi-provocative formalist knickknack"
0,"Its effect, as a whole, is like that of an especially vile infection; it moves diabolically through your system, spreading fever and nausea as it goes."
0,The movie needs to evoke more than the ghost of Genet to give it resonance.
1,"Compelling and quirkily intelligent; Genet, one feels, would have been impressed."
1,"Boldly self conscious, Poison switches channels among its three stylistically varied but thematically linked tales with cumulative, claustrophobic power."
1,"Todd Haynes' Poison is a conceptually bold, stylistically audacious first feature, a compelling study of different forms of deviance."
1,"I could have done without the designer prison, but most of the other stylistic conceits work."
1,Arguably the strongest American debut feature of the '90s.
1,"Proves that when a maverick virtuoso like Scorsese sets his mind to it, making ''mainstream'' movies is one more thing he can do better than just about anyone else."
1,"Impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions."
1,"It's a brutal, demonic film with a grip like a vise; it grabs you early, its fingers around your throat, and never lets go."
1,It's a helluva movie.
1,"Though Scorsese doesn't always transcend the pulp in Cape Fear, watching him try allows us to share the exhilaration he experiences behind the camera."
1,"Stay away if you're squeamish but, if you do, you'll miss an essential work by one of our masters, as well as two of the year's most accomplished performances, those of Mr. De Niro and Ms. Lewis."

0,"It's hard to understand why Martin Scorsese wanted to remake a nasty, formulaic 1962 thriller whose only ""classic"" credentials are a terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum and a Bernard Herrmann score."
1,
1,"It gives you a pumped-up, thrill-happy ride (assuming you have a stomach for violent pulp) but it doesn't linger in the mind as Scorsese's richest movies do. It's a swell B movie dressed in haute cinematic couture."
0,"The wrath of De Niro, especially when pitched to the level of a jangle-brained Jehovah, is a mighty thing, but, in this case, its inherent cartoonery capsizes this film's small-story frame."

1,Compelling info-ganda.
1,A riveting marriage of fact and fiction.
1,"Costner may not resemble the real Garrison much ... but the actor, in a low-key but forceful performance, nicely conveys the requisite grit, curiosity and fearlessness."
1,"Oliver Stone has created a maelstrom of images here. Seamlessly blending real black and white footage of Kennedy's murder with his own re-staged scenes, and working the two together results in a film that can't decide which way to go."
1,"As speculation, JFK is riveting. As proof, it's bunk. Stone has turned what he considers the crime of the century into a disturbing anomaly -- a dishonest search for truth."
0,The film's insurmountable problem is the vast amount of material it fails to make coherent sense of.
1,"Stone goes for the gut, but the complexity of theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination might have benefited from a cooler assessment."
0,"Sad to say, Oliver Stone's three hours of bombast did little to raise the level of discussion."
1,
0,"While Stone has certainly stirred up the waters, with good conscience and, in JFK's own parlance, ""with vigah,"" most people are likely to regard JFK as BS."
1,"""The Man in the Moon"" is a wonderful movie, but it is more than that, it is a victory of tone and mood. It is like a poem."
0,"""The Man in the Moon"" is an intimate, sentimental coming-of-age drama, a sweet little puppy love movie crushed by the enormity of its tragic twists."
1,"Gets an outstandingly natural performance out of Miss Witherspoon, who has no trouble carrying a lot of the film single-handedly. It falls to her to remind the audience that this story is at heart about a family, and she does."
1,The heart-warming tone steadily becomes overheated.
1,Newcomer Witherspoon manages to strike exactly the right note as the tomboy on the verge of womanhood while Waterston works on several levels at once.
0,The Prize is a suspense melodrama played for laughs. Trouble is the basic comedy approach clashes with the political-topical framework of the story.
1,"Mark Robson's direction gives The Prize tension and humor, and a good deal of interesting characterization. The Prize should be a much discussed and popular attraction."
1,"This feel-good finale might feel even better, though, if it had any true connection to the pat, amiable, and rather dawdling farce that preceded it."
1,"This is a movie with heart, and there are little moments in it when Martin is deeply moved by the fact that this perfect creature he brought into the world is now going to start a family of her own."
1,[A] slight but delightfully sweet-natured new comedy starring Steve Martin.
0,"After a provocative setup, this Touchstone Pictures offering pads innocuously down the aisle, a remake that doesn't touch the Spencer Tracy classic of the same name."
1,"The material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film's most memorable moments have been preserved."
0,"Some sequences and dialogue are lifted directly from the original, but in the wider context, this merely serves to underline the remake's comparative lack of tenderness and subtlety."
1,"Best stuff here comes strsight from Martin, such as his frenzied antics in the in-laws' house or his ridiculous Tom Jones imitation in front of a mirror in a too-tight tuxedo."
0,"Neither the '90s nor the husband-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer (they wrote the new version, she co-produced, he directed) can match the original film's grace or wit."
0,The film's sole dramatic preoccupations are with broad physical comedy and unrealistically offbeat characterizations; a few moments of nominal pathos are really just structural pauses in the joke series.
1,
1,"The movie depends on two strong performances for its effects, and gets them from Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh."
1,"It's a tough movie, scathingly violent, intense and emotionally raw; like a swaggering bar brawler, it never backs down an inch."
0,"It peaks way before the movie's over. You're caught in a slow but steady decline, an unwanted comedown."
1,"Despite the false notes and grinding bleakness, the film's insider savvy makes for pungent drama."
1,Mr. Patric and Ms. Leigh are able to make Jim and Kristen as grimly memorable as the drug culture that threatens to engulf them both.
0,Zanuck's debut feature fails to keep its dramatic sightlines clear.
1,Head-swiveling directorial debut of Lili Fini Zanuck lays out a tough masculine scenario [based on Kim Wozencraft's book] in a way that is always emotionally riveting.
0,"Leigh is effective as always, but has little to chew on; Patric has even less."

0,"An archetypal 40s ghost story, ambitiously decked out in high studio finery, with billowing curtains and other kinds of hyperromantic kitsch that can put you in mind of death by tuberculosis, though ultimately it's a bit of a letdown."
1,"The real strength of the film, though, is its atypical stance part way between psychology and the supernatural, achieving a disturbingly serious effect."
1,"The one thing -- and the only thing -- about this film is that it sets out to give you the shivers -- and will do so, if you're readily disposed."
1,"For modern audiences, the movie is more elegantly creepy than truly scary, but it still charms."
0,The film is technically sophisticated and emotionally retarded.
1,"As a modest fun movie, it works, much helped by deep casting contrasts and a nice sense of absurd proportions."
1,"The cast does its stuff to good effect. Coward, as the highly patriotic, business-like master crook, brings all his imperturbable sense of irony and comedy to his role."
0,"Caine and Coward play a splendid game of verbal tennis, but by the final reel the laughs are lost in an anthology of dull and deafening car chases."
1,Is there a film - certainly a British film - that delivers a greater infusion of pure joy than The Italian Job?
1,The brio and ambition of The Italian Job can't be doubted and Caine has enormous charisma...
1,"What The Italian Job has to revive the viewer of the drowsy first 70 minutes is a whopping good third-act mini-car chase, one which will inevitably compared to the daredevil hill vaulting of Bullitt."
0,
0,"If I were under the age of 14 and had not already seen all of those earlier animal movies, I might well have enjoyed Beethoven more. It's the kind of clever, innocuous family entertainment that's always in short supply."
1,"A waggish tale of canine chicanery, an uproarious if impawsible symphony of drool, doggy fidelity and chewed shoes."
1,"Beethoven is no classic, but it's a sunny, energetic children's film with a good notion of what young audiences like."
1,"Elevated from the doldrums of Digby-esque sentimentality by a surprisingly bouncy script, the film is also redeemed by regular interludes of acerbic dialogue and a brace of fine supporting performances."
1,Rallies at the end to prevent chaperoning adults from feeling their time was completely wasted.

0,"Everything's played so big, there's no room for singles, small details that show touching moments. In Babe, everything's got to be a homer or nothing."
0,The Babe is a muddy field of dreams fertilized with a whole lot of Bull Durham.
0,"Aside from being superficially written, aside from being shot with little sense of time or place, the movie portrays Babe Ruth as a man almost completely lacking in the ability to have, or to provide, happiness."
1,"The Babe, set mostly in the 1920's, has an elaborate period look, but it is held together almost entirely by Mr. Goodman's performance and Ruth's penchant for miracles."
1,"Surprisingly interesting, even if you don't know a home run from a stolen base."
0,"Despite Haxell Wexler's alluring lensing, this thinly dramatized, overly episodic Babe Ruth biopic resembles a telepic that has lost its way onto the big screen."
1,Goodman inspires extraordinary empathy.
0,"It's not a bad movie. But its sentiments are faster than its reflexes. By the time it tries to uncoil a home-run swing, the ball has already vanished."
0,"Goodman should have been perfect for the title role: like Ruth, he's a regular Joe of hugely irregular proportions in appetite and accomplishment. Too bad Hiller and Fusco cut him down to size."
0,"It doesn`t matter that these things really happened, because the thin staging and sentimental exaggeration make them seem extremely phony in any case."
1,"An honestly unheroic view of a hero, with a grand-slam performance by John Goodman."
0,What could have been the Raging Bull of baseball movies becomes the nibble of a mouse on the legend of a giant.
1,"Thanks to Goodman and the great Ruth mystique, The Babe does maintain a median level of entertainment. But somehow you want a movie about a fellow this big-natured and mythic to hit a home run. What we have here is more of a solid base hit."
0,"Like Goodman's attempts to connect with the ball, The Babe lacks follow-through."
0,Certainly almost every aspect of the plot seems preprogrammed; the movie is like a series of compulsory exercises.
1,"For unadulterated fun, The Cutting Edge may not earn a gold medal, but it's worth at least a bronze."
0,"We've heard those trumpet riffs before; we watched Rocky do push-ups to them. And that's all ""The Cutting Edge"" is -- ""Rocky"" on skates."
0,"There is essentially not an original moment in the entire film, and yet it's skillfully made and well-acted."
0,"This movie's ""Flashdance"" on blades, an unending series of rock videos posing as a story."
1,Ms. Kelly's uncompromising portrayal of a high-strung prima donna whose outrageous willfulness masks a girlish vulnerability gives the picture a big charge of energy.
0,"A[n]... ice-skating obsessive might find something praiseworthy in all this predictable, ham-fisted, romantic tosh."
1,"The Cuttingedge it isn't, but this neatly formulaic romantic comedy has a sharp enough combination of teen-oriented elements and style."
1,The movie is shamelessly watchable romantic schlock for the Sassy set.
1,The chemistry between the co-stars makes it work.
0,The only thing that would have made this palatable in a mildly camp sort of way would have been the skating sequences.
1,"A rousing though late-arriving crowd-pleaser of sufficient wit, vitality and intelligence that you don't have to be a teen-ager to be thoroughly entertained by it."

1,The idea of the Dennehy's illegal boxing arena is a storytelling masterstroke; it explains the small crowds at the same time it permits the boxers to fight dirty.

0,Let's make things perfectly clear. Gladiator is utter trash masquerading as an action picture with a message.
0,"The mixture may be slightly unexpected, but it still manages to be predictable all the way."
1,"Marshall makes a promising feature debut; and Herrington, pushing beyond the expected triumph-of-the-underdog clich챕s, underpins the crowd-pleasing Rocky-style fight action with some unobtrusive social comment and confident visual storytelling."

0,"third-rate blaxploitation picture for the '90s, it aims to be street-tough and an admonishment against drugs. It manages to be neither."
0,"Larry Fishburne is clearly a star of the future, but Deep Cover won't be the vehicle."
1,"What sets Deep Cover apart is its sense of good and evil, the way it has the Fishburne character agonize over the moral decisions he has to make."
1,"Rather than ride the easy cynicism of the script, by Michael Tolkin and Henry Bean, Fishburne illuminates his character's moral struggle."
0,Deep Cover eventually degenerates into so much gratuitous violence that 'kill' sounds like the most-used verb in the screenplay's last stages.
1,"In addition to Fishburne, it gives us a first-rate soundtrack, a clutch of splendid cameos, fine, grainy direction from Duke, and much pointed stuff about the hypocrisy behind the USA's so-called war against drugs."
1,"Convoluted and mostly unconvincing as a portrait of the drug underworld, Deep Cover [based on a story by Michael Tolkin] still carries some resonance due to its vivid portrait of societal decay and a heavyweight performance by Larry Fishburne."
1,"What emerges is a powerhouse thriller full of surprises, original touches, and rare political lucidity, including an impressive performance by Jeff Goldblum."
0,Miracle on 34th Street this ain't.
0,All I want for Christmas is to never see All I Want for Christmas again.
0,"When it comes to yuletide cheer, All I Want for Christmas ranks just under dead reindeer on the roof."
0,"What makes the film so nauseating is not that it's badly acted or made, but that its motives are presented with such sledgehammer subtlety that even the youngest children would feel insulted by it."
0,"This 1991 feature is not for diabetics or connoisseurs of real people, but everyone else should have a ball."
0,"Class Act takes a fairly radical idea and turns it into a sitcom, although not without giving us some idea of the possibilities it has missed."
1,Jarman's sparely elegant but urgently brazen recasting of Marlowe's tragedy seizes the theme of the historic (and artistic) vilification of homosexuality.
1,"...It's a good film, and Gordon is uncanny in the way he suggests the eerie forest mysteries that permeate all of the action."
1,...Gordon shows the kind of filmmaking talent that creates genuine excitement.
1,"A Midnight Clear tells a wartime yarn that's quietly, often lyrically, winning."
1,"In A Midnight Clear, just about everything works."
1,The performances are uniformly excellent as the film moves inexorably towards bloody confrontation and spiritual reckoning.
1,This fable about the futility of the war benefits not only from fine performances but an intelligent and literate offscreen narration that enhances the movie's conceptual integrity.
1,"A Midnight Clear doesn't do as much as it might with its characters. But as a parable of human folly and fragile hope, it has considerable impact."
1,"[Gordon] clearly relishes the story's many ironies, and he's often successful at sharing his enjoyment of them with us."
0,It's so determined to be haunting that it gives up the ghost.
1,"A Midnight Clear -- not quite a great war movie but certainly a sensitive, bright and supremely moral one -- shows how courage itself can be a kind of insanity."
1,"Despite such peculiarities, or perhaps because of them, A Midnight Clear has a quirky, haunting quality, delivering good performances all around, but especially from Sinise, Hawke and Frank Whaley."
1,"The sentiments aren`t fresh, but the skill of the writing and a superior ensemble American cast makes the drama memorable."
1,A Midnight Clear is powerful without being overbearing.

1,"Murphy gives his most appealing performance to date, using his smug, self-satisfied, sly smile as a joke on his own well-known screen persona."
1,"Boomerang is the funniest, most sophisticated movie of Eddie Murphy's career."
1,"Whatever [Murphy] was thinking during the dark days of his career slump, it seems to have paid off handsomely."
0,"For all the sex talk in Boomerang, there's very little nudity. The only thing naked is Murphy's vanity."
0,"There's something paradoxical about the ease he radiates in playing a man who is supposed to be a smashing success. As an underdog, Mr. Murphy worked much harder."
0,"The film is far too slick to be ineffective, but its attempts to play with the sex-war theme are often unbelievably crass."
0,In Boomerang Eddie Murphy straitjackets himself in an ill-fitting comedy vehicle that's desperately in need of a reality check.
1,"The general idea is to exploit a certain amount of role reversal, and Reginald Hudlin, who directed House Party, does a fairly good job of making this fun."
0,
0,"As for the movie, the makers of Casablanca can sleep peacefully. Come to think of it, so can the makers of Ernest Scared Stupid."

0,Rapid Fire is a movie weary almost onto death with the sameness of its genre.
0,"The movie is shameless in exploiting the father-son connection to try to make the star, who exudes a bored, dead-eyed cool, seem sympathetic."
1,Director Dwight H. Little expertly handles implausible but entertaining action sequences that keep the pic lively despite a schlocky plot and cardboard characterizations.
1,"The new film version of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is lyrical, stirring, and beautifully acted -- a seamless adaptation of a novel many will recall with almost too much familiarity."
1,"Happily, director/star/co-producer Gary Sinise has approached it not with the awe of an English professor, but with the practical eye of a craftsman: Here are solid characters, a taut and emotional story, a beginning, a middle and a wrenching end."
1,"The great pleasure of this movie is in what performers Sinise and John Malkovich, Ray Walton and others do with it; what director Sinise does with it; and, perhaps most important, what screenwriter Horton Foote does with it."
1,"I would not have thought I could believe the line about the rabbits one more time, but this movie made me do it, as Lennie asks about the farm they'll own one day, and George says, yes, it will be just as they've imagined it."
1,"Of Mice and Men is a mournful, distantly heard lament for the loss of American innocence."
0,"It's hard ... to believe Malkovich's shamble and gape, a simian variant on Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man."
1,"Well-mounted and very traditional, Of Mice and Men honorably serves John Steinbeck's classic story of two Depression-era drifters without bringing anything new to it."

0,Mr. Bakshi's skill as an animator continues to outshine his judgment about subject matter.

0,"A realm with precious little humor and zero pathos, to be admired only for its considerable technical achievements."
0,"After the painstaking technical bravado of Roger Rabbit, it's no longer possible to get away with scenes in which a cartoon has obviously just been pasted onto an actor's wooden movements."
0,"A few of Bakshi`s inventions, such as a rattled telephone that panics every time it rings, are amusing and well animated, but most of the characters are grating and dislikable."
0,What Bakshi and his screenwriters don't recognize is that even dream worlds have their own fierce logic.
0,"Watching Byrne, Basinger and Pitt struggle to bring verisimilitude to this cockeyed business is painful. And watching the parade of ricocheting doodles is just headache-inducing."
1,"The plot is too sketchy to provide much of a framework, and the only logic here is the logic of fevered daydreams. Yet, in spurts, the movie's enjoyable."
0,"Bakshi's world is typically subversive, anti-nostalgic and, at times, a brilliantly conceived grafting of two and three dimensions. Unfortunately, its ingenuity matrix seems to have short-circuited."
1,A disarmingly sweet-spirited comedy written and directed by Cameron Crowe.
1,A diverting collection of interwoven vignettes.
1,The movie will challenge some audiences simply because it is not a 1-2-3 progression of character and plot.
1,Fonda is absolutely charming and sweetly resilient as her new and old relationships overlap.
1,Mr. Crowe has an exceptional ability to enjoy such characters without a trace of condescension.
1,"Crowe suffuses the film with tender humour and affection as the characters, most of them living in the same apartment block, swap stories, ponder sexual come-ons where none exist, and remain resolute in the face of emotional horrors."
1,"There's no shortage of tender moments in this comedy, and former rock journalist Cameron Crowe cleverly transforms 'real' problems into crackerjack material."
0,"Singles may aspire to be a Big Chill from Seattle, but it is really a fizzled St. Elmo's Fire with rowdier music."
0,So lightweight that you're likely to start forgetting it before it's even over.
1,This is one happy-ending romance that doesn't feel forced. You can't help getting into the spirit of it.
1,"This is romantic comedy of the wispiest kind, but the picture is generous, graceful, and consistently funny."
1,"There's a genial untidiness about Singles, but it's unified by Crowe's affection for his characters, and by the terrific Paul Westerberg music track, which plays like a pulse-beat to these people's lives."
1,"There is something new here, and very fresh."
1,"Crowe doesn't add much to the general discussion, but he's assembled an attractive cast and seems to have a genuine affection for the young people on the screen."
1,"Crowe's movie is like a great record album: the songs connect, and the people connect, too."
1,A first-rate police thriller.
0,A rather overrated police-procedure thriller which has gained its seminal status simply by its accent on ordinariness and by its adherence to the ideal of shooting on location.
1,A definite parochial fascination is liberally assured all the way and the seams in a none-too-good whodunnit are rather cleverly concealed.
1,"Throughout, despite its omniscient, stark melodrama, there has been no sight lost of an element of humor."
1,A fascinating relic.
0,Most of the time the pacing is slowed by the talky script.

1,"The real reason to see this movie, though, is because it makes a big yacht race seem so glorious, such grand adventure. Ballard is a former cinematographer with a knack for visualizing the outdoors."

1,"Mann wasn't thinking story, he was thinking scheme. Keep the eyes and ears dazzled, he reasons, and the substance will follow."
1,"Painstakingly, breathtakingly re-created by director Michael Mann, this landscape makes room for heroes with principles greater than the circumference of their biceps."
1,He conceives of the story as if it were a gigantic piece of mood music.
1,...not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be - more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit - but it is probably more entertaining as a result.
1,...the action is richly detailed and thrillingly staged.

1,"What Husbands and Wives argues is that many ""rational"" relationships are actually not as durable as they seem, because somewhere inside every person is a child crying me! me! me!"
1,"Allen, the schlemiel, has humiliated himself and hurt his family, disillusioned his fans and become a case in point for the GOP, but he has also hit upon an issue that is universally applicable."
1,"With its relationship angst and Lolita temptations, Husbands and Wives hits embarrassingly close to Allen's home. But it also hits its comic target."
1,Husbands and Wives is a defining film for these emotionally embattled times; it's classic Woody Allen.
1,"Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives is a very fine, sometimes brutal comedy about a small group of contemporary New Yorkers."
1,"With excellent performances (Davis and Pollack in particular), it's his finest film since Hannah and Her Sisters."
1,"It doesn't suffer from the compulsive tidiness of some of Allen's later movies -- the juices are flowing, the hysteria is closer to the surface -- and in this looser, more volatile atmosphere his extraordinary cast gets to soar."
1,"In all respects, this is a full meal, as it deals with the things of life with intelligence, truthful drama and rueful humor."
1,"Allen's conception of character is as banal and shallow as ever, but the lively performances of some of his actors and the novelty of the film's style make this more watchable than many of his features."
1,
1,"In a sense, Woody Allen lets himself off the hook by having his character hold back from adultery, and even seem the victim of Mia Farrow's character. But this is not a smug movie, and much the better for it."
0,"It's strange how sour the results can be; Husbands and Wives takes the same kinds of dancing passions that looped through Hannah and her Sisters, and turns them into a crabby-go-round."
0,"A little more zip, and Hero might really have worked. It has all the ingredients for a terrific entertainment, but it lingers over the kinds of details that belong in a different kind of movie."
0,Colorful vignettes... only touch on but do not fully reveal the drama or the history behind the events.
0,Richardson's bushranger biopic merely applies a simplistic gloss to the 'outlaw' image already projected onto Jagger... and his role as the legendary Australian anti-hero emerges as little more than an uncomfortable displacement of his tabloid notoriety.
0,It is a film to which one applies the damning word 'interesting'.
1,Vidor's strict adherence to realism is so effective at times it is stark and uncanny.

0,"""Forever Young,"" which turns on contrivances of plot rather than aspects of character, is as cheap emotionally as it is ideologically."
1,"Mr. Gibson is good enough to give the film substance, making ""Forever Young"" far easier to sit through than it has any right to be."
1,"Looked at with a jaundiced eye, the scenario is slushy and full of holes; surrendered to in a spirit of careless romanticism, it works."
1,"Remarkably, the director manages to toe the line of melodrama without ever slipping over into camp, balancing those elements with humor and suspense to carry ""Forever Young,"" if not over the moon, at least up in the clouds."
0,A ripoff screenplay as shameless as this might survive if the casting were particularly good.

1,A delightful comedy and one of the most charming movies in a long time.

1,"Enjoy it for the handsome wide-screen vistas, the interplay of the actors, the classical sweep of its story line. Just don't expect the new, soul-searching Eastwood to be any more dramatically convincing than the old."
0,"By now ... Eastwood has little more than a paint-by-numbers approach to acting. As a result, we relate to Munny more as a compendium of Eastwood's earlier characters."
1,This is the best work Eastwood has done as a director since The Outlaw Josey Wales 16 years ago.
1,"Jumps adroitly between the macho and anti-macho, the romantic and anti-romantic."
1,"In three decades of climbing into the saddle, Eastwood has never ridden so tall."
1,"That implacable moral balance, in which good eventually silences evil, is at the heart of the Western, and Eastwood is not shy about saying so."
1,Unforgiven is a most entertaining western that pays homage to the great tradition of movie westerns while surreptitiously expressing a certain amount of skepticism.
1,"In this dark, timeless terrain, the film achieves a magnificent intensity."
0,There's not much dramatic urgency apart from the revisionist context.
1,A classic Western for the ages.
1,"One of Unforgiven's assets is the way it overturns conventions, taking the man who is typically the hero and making him the villain, while transforming the traditional bad guy into a sympathetic protagonist."
1,"Eastwood's meditation on age, repute, courage, heroism -- on all those burdens he has been carrying with such good grace for decades."
1,"Eastwood's disturbingly human in Unforgiven, a stunning, dark Western that may stand as the actor/director's summation of the form."
0,"Individual scenes work, but the movie seems overstuffed and halting."
1,"This is the finest set of performances ever to grace a Clint Eastwood movie, and this time Eastwood even does a good job directing Eastwood. Every bullet in this movie matters."
1,"This dark, melancholic film is a reminder-never more necessary than now-of what the American cinema is capable of, in the way of expressing a mature, morally complex and challenging view of the world."
1,"[Unforgiven] belongs to a tradition that includes such giants of the genre as Mann, Boetticher, Peckinpah and Hawks."
1,It shouldn't be missed by anyone with a taste for Eastwood's typically slanted morality. It's the actor/director's best movie -- and the best Western by anybody -- in over 20 years.
1,"Unforgiven ain't nuthin' new, y'unnerstan', but it's a good, old-fashioned western-type pitcher with plenty o' rootin' tootin' action 'n' big ol' horses 'n' 10-gallon hats 'n' sech."
1,"Eastwood deliberately upends the conventions of the western, subverting his own image in the process."
1,The Western is back. With a vengeance. Saddle up or get out of the way.
1,"""Unforgiven"" is a high-caliber movie, a gripping and haunting work of art that should finally establish Eastwood as one of America's best directors."
1,"A sombre, insightful, genre-reinventing western, directed by a filmmaker acutely aware of the western's history, its limitations and the dubious truths of its legends."
1,"Unforgiven is a stark western in slow motion, obsessed with reflection, not action."
1,"While not a pretty picture... Unforgiven is a magnificently realized work. In addition to Eastwood's fine, rough performance, Hackman and Freeman stand out."
1,Unforgiven gives us something to think about -- and something to answer for -- and Eastwood was just the man to make it.
1,Clint Eastwood's brilliant and harrowing Unforgiven packs all the punch of a good Western without indulging in the plot cliches and moral certitudes so often inherent in the genre.
1,Apart from giving the Western genre a powerful boost Unforgiven does wonders for Eastwood's own profile.
1,"The movie itself has considerable qualities, among them Martin's performance as Nightengale. This isn't the sleek, groomed, prosperous Steve Martin we've seen in movies like L.A. Story. It's Martin as a seedy, desperate, bright, greedy man without hope."
0,The movie is lively but half-baked: it dribbles away its promising subject. Some Christmas feast this has turned out to be: it's like munching on leftovers.
1,
1,A spiritually enriching testament to the human capacity for change -- and surely Spike Lee's most universally appealing film.
1,"Lee has chosen a big subject and, with his quirky talent, has done it superb justice."
0,"Lee's movie, despite good intentions, does not inspire any visceral realities. It simply is too superficial, too theatrically poised without the hard-edge that could have made it a masterpiece."
1,"This is an extraordinary life, and Spike Lee has told it in an extraordinary film."
1,"An ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization."
1,It plays surprisingly safe as a solidly crafted trawl through the didactic/hagiographic conventions of the mainstream biopic.
0,"Lee sketches Malcolm's life colorfully, if by the numbers. But he falls victim to the danger of movie biography: he elevates Malcolm's importance until the vital historical context is obscured."
1,"Lee and company have performed a powerful service: they have brought Malcolm X very much to life again, both as man and myth."
0,Spike Lee has made a disappointingly conventional and sluggish film in Malcolm X.
0,"Benefits from a lively lead performance by the miscast Denzel Washington but doesn't come within light years of the book, one of the greatest American autobiographies."
1,
1,"An epic picaresque in the tradition of Rain Man, Scent of a Woman is Al Pacino's entry into the Dustin Hoffman virtousic-one-man-show sweepstakes."
1,"By the end of Scent of a Woman, we have arrived at the usual conclusion of the coming-of-age movie, and the usual conclusion of the prep school movie. But rarely have we been taken there with so much intelligence and skill."
0,"When all Pacino's demons are bared, they don't add up to the poignant punchline you were set up for."
1,"As portrayed by Pacino, there's far more to this man that a rancorous outlook on life and a couple of hearty ""hoo-ha""s."
1,"This is a great performance from Pacino, who has the good luck here to work with Goldman's mostly wonderful, edgy script."
1,The good thing is that the principals and film makers make the absolute most of a conventional opportunity.
1,"Corny and heart-warming, with O'Donnell proving almost a match for the master."
0,Scent of a Woman indulgently stretches a modest conceit well past the breaking point.
0,"An irascible bully who proves to have a heart of gold, Pacino's character seems manufactured by a computer programmed with box-office grosses."
0,
0,This is the kind of movie that is so witlessly generic that the plot and title disappear into a mist of other recycled plots and interchangeable titles.
0,"Except for a few short bursts here and there, and one extended scene during the climax, the film is mostly talk. And since Van Damme's range as a dramatic actor is marginal at best, this is a problem."
0,"While it boasts better supporting actors and technical credits than other Van Damme projects, the film nonetheless founders, a victim of its own lugubrious pace and misguided efforts at turning the bulging Belgian into a romantic lead."
0,"Several members of the Astor Plaza audience yesterday afternoon could not contain their merriment when, in the middle of the film, Mr. Van Damme's character identified himself as a lawyer."
1,When Van Damme is doing what he does best -- narcissistically displaying his body and thumping the bad guys -- the film works reasonably well.
0,A relentlessly corny and shamelessly derivative vehicle.

1,"Sniper expresses a cool competence that is a pleasure to watch. It isn't a particularly original film, but what it does, it does well."
0,
1,
0,A case study in how Hollywood can make a complete mess out of what was previously a marvelous film.
0,The first movie was existential in its merciless unfolding. This one turns into a slasher movie with a cheap joke at the end.
0,"[Screenwriter Todd Graff] duplicates many of the original scenes (particularly the significant gas station ones), but does so mechanically. He jettisons most of the subtleties that made the first film so memorable."
0,"Too much of what is good about the original The Vanishing has been eviscerated. If you want quality, see the Dutch version; this one is a pale imitation."
0,"Misjudged, compromised Hollywood remake."
0,Schematic and unconvincing.
1,
0,There's something scuzzy about the whole exercise.
0,"The story not only relies on the complete and unalterable stupidity of every character in the movie, but on the gullibility of those who watch it."
0,Grindingly predictable and mechanically played.
0,Leaves much to be desired.
0,
1,This is a story more interested in tone and mood than in big plot points.
0,A mish-mash of mediocre formulas.
0,"Just too pat, too predictable and too generic."
0,"If you like to go to weddings of humdrum people you don't know, you won't want to miss Indian Summer."
1,"Mike Binder places his well-acted comedy in the familiar turf of other ""reunion"" films (Return of Secaucus Seven, Big Chill), adding one element to the genre: Instead of indoor weekend, the regrouping is set in a beloved camp of the 1972 summer"
0,
0,"The location photography is impressive, the scenery is awesome, the re-enactment of the air crash is terrifying and uses convincing special effects. We care about the characters while we watch the movie. But at the end it all seems elusive."

0,"Marshall is a good technician, but there's no sense of artistic adventure in his sometimes exciting, sometimes draggy movie. He's content to scratch the surface of a great and harrowing story."

1,"Point of No Return is actually a fairly effective and faithful adaptation [of La Femme Nikita], and Bridget Fonda manages the wild identity-swings of her role with intensity and conviction."

1,"More than anything, Fonda gives this glossy, reasonably entertaining rerun an American raison d'etre."
1,
1,"Brother's Keeper, the year's best documentary, has an impact and immediacy that most fiction films can only envy."
1,"A discomforting, almost surreal study of a rural murder case, which offers fascinating insights about both family and community dynamics."
0,
0,There's little (if anything) to recommend this movie.
0,"There's no sense of screwball mayhem in the picture, no topsy-turvy brightness."
0,"In old Hollywood, style could make up for a lack of substance, but this remake is without either."
0,"This is supposed to be snappy material, and it comes across gloomy."
0,"To the growing list of unnecessary movies, add this remake of the Garson Kanin comedy."
0,"There is a fatal disconnection between place and characters who, conceived in one era, are crazily transported into another in which they don't quite fit."
0,"Where Holliday was always too sophisticated a butterfly right from the off, Griffith's copycat performance starts dumb -- but then never takes wing."
0,The verdict on the makeover is not all good news.
0,The gin rummy game with Griffith and Goodman instead of Holliday and Crawford is enough to ruin a night out.

1,"Stalker, a somber futuristic fantasy from the Soviet Union, attempts to build an apocalyptic vision out of the most impoverished materials imaginable."
1,"Tarkovsky majestically creates through editing rather than special effects the unstable universe of the Zone, and amidst the grime and the destruction, summons up moments of pure magic."
1,"Tarkovsky conjures images like you've never seen before; and as a journey to the heart of darkness, it's a good deal more persuasive than Coppola's."
1,A vast prose-poem on celluloid whose forms and ideas were to be borrowed by moviemakers like Lynch and Spielberg.
1,"Not an easy film, but almost certainly a great one."
1,Tarkovsky realizes the allegorical tale with an overwhelming density of visual detail ...
1,"The pursuit of happiness takes on a meandering, philosophical and richly visual form in Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker."
1,"The film has a hypnotic pull, drawing the viewer deeper and deeper into its enigmatic adventure by crafting a world all its own."
1,"There are no flying saucers in the great Russian director's haunting tale of a journey into the depths of a postapocalyptic landscape, but it offers visual splendor, as well as mysteries, portents and miracles."
1,"It's a film that challenges us to be bored, while refusing to be boring."
1,Yet Stalker is a movie to be watched as many times as physically possible... It really is that astounding.
1,"It is masterfully done, contains some haunting images, and has a difficult-to-pinpoint mesmerism in the way it progresses. Once it gets you (which, for some, may never happen), it will hold you like a fly trapped in amber."
0,"The schoolmaster to whom our pity is drawn is a pretty weak and lukewarm individual, hardly fit to be a teacher of growing boys -- even a teacher of classical languages, which he is."
0,"What begins as an anti-Goodbye, Mr. Chips ends, thanks to some psychological point stretching, as an imitation of it."
1,Worth watching for Redgrave's powerfully detailed performance as the schoolmaster.
1,"The role of the retiring master is not an easy one, but a prize in the right hands. Michael Redgrave fills it with distinction."
0,
0,"An overdirected, overphotographed, overdone movie that is so distracted by its hectic, relentless style that the story line is rendered almost incoherent."
0,"Some interesting race-related points are raised, but Van Peebles disappoints by focusing instead on the standard elements of the genre."
1,Rousing entertainment directed by Van Peebles with a rare sense of purpose and mischief.
0,"''Posse,'' which could have been a moving and gripping tribute to black Western heroes - and a testament against bigotry and injustice - ends up with laughs in all the wrong places."

1,"This isn't a great movie, but it sure is a nice one."
0,"A predictably thick-headed, occasionally plodding bacchanalia of blood, grunts and testosterone."
0,"Whether Cliffhanger will bring Stallone's name back into the top echelon of action movie stars has yet to be determined, but if this film can't, the task may be impossible."
1,"Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three-mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him."
1,"Just pull the plug on your judgment, good sense and values. Remember to leave enough motor skills to face forward -- that's where the screen is."
1,One of the best action thrillers of the '90s.
1,"Cliffhanger, the new high-altitude thriller starring Sylvester Stallone, wastes no time in establishing its first priority, that of sending its audience into a cold sweat."
0,"Fun for the undemanding, but Stallone's 'comeback' should have been much tighter."
1,Cliffhanger lives up to its title as a two-hour rollercoaster ride that never stops.
1,"Despite the don't-look-down Olympian settings, Cliffhanger's spirit is brutal and earthbound. The movie is like one of those computer-designed simulator rides that whip you around until you're dizzy and aching but don't actually take you anywhere."
1,"We are not at Cliffhanger for realism; we're there for the cliffhanging, and there's plenty of it."
0,It's hard to think of a movie my feelings have been more divided on.
1,it has truly awe-inspiring stunts and special effects and many of its suspense sequences will leave you with your heart in your mouth.
0,"The fact that so much money was lavished on such a thick-headed project represents the height of fiscal ineptitude, but this is the kind of roller-coaster ride for which eager audiences will gladly check their brains at the turnstiles, so go figure."
1,"The cinematography and gravity-defying stunt performances are exhilarating. The story, alas, is pure routine."
0,Some movies get you so excited - so revved up on action and thrills -- that you almost feel like you're flying. Cliffhanger makes you feel like you're dropping.
0,"That rasping tension is soon smoothed away, as the plot sets off on its daft and hackneyed course."
0,"Cliffhanger no doubt makes for a great coming attraction, but as a two-hour movie its claims are much more problematic."
0,Take away the mountains and what you have is a howlingly bad action film with a cornball villain out to steal a massive amount of United States currency from federal agents.
1,"Like the roller-coaster ride Cliffhanger clearly wants to be, the film sends you out pleasantly rattled and wobbly of gait."
0,"Cliffhanger does its damnedest to see that the audience gets its money's worth of thrills. But for all the state-of-the-art stunt work, the movie has little personality; it's ice cream without flavor."
0,The florid direction and overdone thesping do the work in; it's time to give the much-used Shelley book - subject of countless film versions since a 1910 16 -minute silent - a long rest.
0,"Pollack makes a solid job of it, as does Cruise. But solid isn't enough when it comes to thrillers -- or courtroom dramas, for that matter. Solid is great when it comes to office furniture."
1,"With a screenplay that developed the story more clearly, this might have been a superior movie, instead of just a good one with some fine performances."
0,"Very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen, and what we're left with instead is an overly-long (two hours and thirty-four minutes, to be exact), pedantic thriller."
1,"Cruise was born to play company man, and the role is an opportunity to sum up his old roles and transcend them with his most potently emotional work."
0,"The book moved at turbo speed. At two and a half hours, the movie crawls."
0,The movie is extremely long (two hours and 34 minutes) and so slow that by the end you feel as if you've been standing up even if you've been sitting down.
1,"Adorning the film, in supporting roles, are its saving graces."
0,Tom Cruise heads a tony cast in a best-seller movie that is firm at the start and infirm by the end.
1,The Firm amusingly satirizes the New Traditionalist aspirations of today's young urban elite -- not so much the lifestyle itself as the illusion of utter security it represents.
1,A smooth adaptation of John Grisham's giant bestseller that is destined to be one of the summer's strong audience pleasers.
1,"A summer genre movie for grown-ups, The Firm helps restore faith in Hollywood professionalism."
1,"Not a great film, but a remarkable one, with Hitchcock at his most 'innovative.'"
1,Hitch's most overtly Hitchcockian silent film ...
0,"The picture has a very, very excellent begining, a mediocre middle and a most deplorable ending. A minor fault is that its running time is about fifteen minutes too long."
1,"This restoration of Hitchcock's 1926 silent melodrama offers a gripping prehistory not just of his own work, but the Hollywood thriller itself."
1,"One for Hitch fans, one for thriller fans, one for cinema fans. Do not miss."
1,"Even with its obvious debt to German Expressionism, The Lodger has Hitchcock hallmarks. It's the master's first film to suggest a certain kind of fun and games as well as thrills."
1,Hitchcock's most underrated movie.

1,"Sometimes a vast fortune, doting servants, great sex and a Jamaican hideaway just aren't enough."
1,"Although Wide Sargasso Sea is a most poetic film, Mr. Duigan uses his poetic effects sparingly."
1,"A strange, dark, muddled dream of a movie, occasionally risible but rarely boring."
1,An uneven but ultimately engrossing feature.
1,
0,"The movie is earnest, heartfelt, and, for all its lavishness, rather plodding."
1,The Secret Garden has at least two things going for it: remarkable acting and mesmerizing cinematography (by Roger Deakins).
1,"It is a work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery, and watching it is like entering for a time into a closed world where one's destiny may be discovered."
1,"What a pleasure -- and what a challenge for the filmmakers -- to come up with a movie that exists primarily on ambience, character interplay, English accents and subtle class differences."
0,"The young actors are quite proficient and un-sappy too -- it's not their fault if they too often seem like chessmen being moved around on the director's board, composed into picturesque tableaux."
1,"Ms. Holland's film of The Secret Garden is elegantly expressive, a discreet and lovely rendering of the children's classic by Frances Hodgson Burnett."
1,"With well-judged performances played straight, and topical subtexts (Green consciousness, the dysfunctional family), this 'children's' film sets no age limit on its potential audience."
1,"It is, first and foremost, a visual delight, a Victorian picture book come to life, from its brief prologue in India through its darkly enchanted recreation of Misselthwaite Manor on the Yorkshire moors."
1,"Executed to near perfection in all artistic departments, this superior adaptation of the perennial favorite novel will find its core public among girls , but should prove satisfying enough to a range of audiences."
1,"The result is an instant classic -- rich, dense, resonant, powerful."
1,"While drawing superb performances from her young leads, Holland has masterfully contrasted the garden -- a place where melodic robins seem almost conversant -- with the dread of Misselthwaite."
1,"The movie's dark themes, unhurried pace and talkiness make it something of a gamble for many children. But older children -- especially those who have been asking specific questions about death -- may find some nourishment in this garden."
1,"This enchanted tale vividly shows how love heals and nurtures barren souls, makes them flourish like abundant Edens."
0,"Rather than a fresh breeze, it's the stale air of gilded calculation, the uncomfortable feeling that things are excessively ""just so,"" that overhangs much that is genuinely appealing about this film."
0,"It's as if the moviemakers were trying to cook up a New Age Yorkshire pudding, without meat drippings -- what's missing is Burnett's robust optimism and animistic energy."
1,"Screenwriter Caroline Thompson and director Agnieszka Holland have turned Frances Hodgson Burnett's rather gothic 1911 children's book into an evocative, beautifully realized picture."
1,"The film is gorgeous to look at, from its period accouterments to its wanderings in explored space (the house is full of secret passageways) to its use of color."

0,"Either Calendar Girl is a blatant attempt to showcase Jason Priestley (of Beverly Hills 90210 fame), or it's an undertaking to make a big-screen copy of the popular 70s sitcom Happy Days."
0,Calendar Girl is clearly waiting to catch the next ride to video oblivion.
0,"Other films, like Robert Zemeckis's I Wanna Hold Your Hand, have had infinitely more fun with similar ideas."
0,"Masquerading as a wild romantic adventure, Calendar Girl is actually a dull, sanctimonious morality tale about the meaning of friendship and manhood in the manner of James Dean's melodramas."
0,"The film revives the voyeuristic smarminess of early-'80s spring-break comedies, only now it's passed off as soulful nostalgia."
1,"Sweet and airy and pleasantly nostalgic, Jason Priestley's first starring vehicle is cotton-candy entertainment for summer's end."
1,"As such, it's a cute picture; if you were looking for the ideal word to describe Calendar Girl, it might be watchable."
0,Can't we just agree to let Marilyn Monroe rest in peace?
0,"On film, the story's charm fades fast."
1,"You get to like Henri and Sophia, maybe more than they like themselves."
0,"Russell takes the mystique away from art, but supplies nothing much in its place."
0,Henri's interesting relationship with the ageing authoress Sophie Brzeska is lost in the director's overriding credo that both art and films are a matter of how much energy you exert.
0,Watchable only for camp value.
1,"The key to the film's success is in the acting, especially in the sparks that fly between Branagh and Thompson."
0,"Somehow, the movie feels insubstantial and uninspired."
1,"Director Branagh, who altered the play imaginatively for the screen, gives wonderful import to this silliness from long ago."
1,"This film cements Branagh's status as a great director of Shakespeare, and perhaps of film in general, as well."
0,"The picture is overripe, and with few exceptions, so are the performances."
1,Kenneth Branagh...has done it again.
1,"There's much to commend in Branagh's pruned, international version of Shakespeare's troubling comedy."
1,Continuously enjoyable from its action-filled opening to the dazzling final shot...
1,"[Branagh] has found his way to the play's profound yet populist heart, rediscovering Shakespeare's vision of romantic fulfillment - celebration with an underlying tug of sadness - for an era that believes itself all too wise to the ways of love."
1,"A spirited, winningly acted rendition of one of the Bard's most popular comedies."
0,"Emma Thompson is normally a very reliable performer on screen, but Beatrice is not one of her successes."
1,"Doyle's enrapturing music and Branagh's cinematic grip of the play--inventive, lithe, somehow Shakespearean--are splendid. This Much Ado is a flawed gem. Certainly, regrettably, flawed; still, a gem."
1,Much Ado About Nothing is one of the few movies of recent years that could leave its audiences weeping with joy.
0,"There are reasons to commend [Rob] Bowman and screenwriter Bill Apablasa, who have gone out of their way to keep Mitchell's character honest. He manages to resolve his conflicts without giving up his values. In other words, nothing happens."
0,"Slackly directed and thinly written, ""Airborne"" exists mainly for its scenes of the big race, in which two teams rocket down a series of winding hills, jumping over cars, scooting under trucks and bouncing down stairs."
0,The occasional action scenes are as appropriately tortuous as the tired teen-out-of-water plot is torturous. This is a kid-flick that's speed-skating on one leg.
0,"The movie turns out to be hyperslick, quite well made in the technical sense (beautifully photographed and designed) and somewhat shallow, another exploration of that perennial and passionate teen theme, fitting in."
0,"Kids might enjoy this teenage fish-out-of-the-surf comedy, but anyone approaching the high school age of the movie's characters will spot the obvious formula within 15 minutes of opening credits."
0,High production values and a moderately appealing cast do nothing to ameliorate the tedium.
0,"Instead of telling a story, the filmmakers follow an outline (or, in this case, an in-line)."
1,"Oddly enough ""Airborne"" is tasty cotton candy for the screen."
1,"While sincerity obviously can't guarantee quality, it's still a refreshing step up from the blatant commercialism of most West Coast media projects."

1,"Gettysburg succeeds as a motion picture event, and as a re-creation of a pivotal chapter of American history."
0,"It's a movie that parades authenticity, but never settles on its own point of view."
0,"Lacking in both inspiration and ingenuity, it doesn't so much spoof the conventions of the genre as dumb down famous -- and in some cases, forgotten -- scenes from a slew of other movies."
0,"Maybe you'll be in the right mood and like this stuff. It looks good, and the actors are several notches above the usual parody cast in ability. And yet..."
0,"If I see another send-up of Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct, I think I'll walk out of the theater."
0,Small jokes are buried under elaborate setups. Sight gags are repeated to the point of exhaustion.
0,A collection of gags that vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit.
0,The filmmakers have provided critics ample artillery by prominently featuring a skunk in this thuddingly flat spoof of erotic thrillers.
0,"It's a real pity, because Reiner has certainly been funnier and more inventive on other outings and Sherilyn Fenn makes a winsome gal Friday."

1,"The Western may be one of the few truly American art forms, and High Noon shows exactly how much potential it can embrace."
1,"A film about what it means to be a man that manages to avoid the musk of machismo, High Noon is truly a film that improves with each and every viewing."
1,"Meaningful in its implications, as well as loaded with interest and suspense, High Noon is a western to challenge Stagecoach for the all-time championship."
1,"Regarded as '50s melodrama, it's nearly perfect."
1,"More than a half-century later, Foreman was right after all: High Noon is a scorching and sour portrait of American complacence and capacity for collaborationism."
1,"High Noon won a fistful of Oscars, but in these days of pasteboard screen machismo, it's worth seeing simply as the anatomy of what it took to make a man before the myth turned sour."
1,"Some of the results ring false, but the memorable theme song and some equally memorable character acting (by Thomas Mitchell and Lon Chaney Jr. more than Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado) help things along."
1,Zinnemann carefully and deliberately makes the most of the mood cast by the threat of impending violence.
1,High Noon combines its points about good citizenship with some excellent picturemaking.

1,"This situation, set in the 1950s, could be the set-up for a sitcom, or a retread of an old Disney family yarn. It ends up being a lot more, partly because Kathy Bates brings a solid, no-nonsense clarity to what could have been a marshmallow role."
0,"Though Kathy Bates and Furlong's acting is decent, there is no reason to see this inspirational saga on the big screen; in scope and goal, it's a suitable TV Movie of the Week."
1,Davis paints with bold visual strokes so that the movie rises above its action-film origins and becomes operatic.
1,"""Innovative"" is not a legitimate description of The Fugitive, but ""entertaining"" is."
1,"A flurry of stunts, close shaves and deeds of desperate daring, it easily transcends its television origins to become a stylish pacemaker-buster on the order of ""Die Hard, MD."""
1,"A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills."
1,"Both stars have toughness and restraint that make their characters' battle of wits truly hypnotic, and in many ways more credible than it was on television."
1,"A glossy, formula chase movie with the requisite number of extravagant action sequences (most notably a massive train crash)."
1,"A consummate nail-biter that never lags, it leaves you breathless from the chase yet anxious for the next bit of mayhem or clever plot twist."
1,"Though it's a good half hour too long, this overblown 1993 spin-off of the 60s TV show otherwise adds up to a pretty good suspense thriller."
1,A first-rate thriller.
1,It isn't just a high-powered summer blockbuster. It's something cannier (and rarer): a suspense thriller rooted in character.
1,"The film is little more than a well-oiled machine that serves a strictly limited function, but like a precision timepiece, it is a thing to marvel at, even under close scrutiny."
1,"For dynamite suspense loaded with thrills and wicked fun, you can't beat The Fugitive."
1,I've already seen The Fugitive twice. I'll probably see it again.
1,"Thoroughly engaging, edge-of-the-seat entertainment."
0,"While there are actors in this film, there isn't much room for acting. The rapid editing and near-absence of dialogue reduces the actors to action figures with colorful labels pasted on their foreheads."
1,"The Fugitive is a super-adrenalized stemwinder, a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the tension so pitilessly tight it does everything but squeak."
1,"It's a pleasure to find a thriller fulfilling its duties with such gusto: the emotions ring solid, the script finds time to relax into backchat, and for once the stunts look like acts of desperation rather than shows of prowess."
1,"Working from a tight script by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, director Andrew Davis has fashioned a crackling, intelligent thriller."
1,"Call something a ""real train wreck"" and it's considered a put-down. Not in this fast-track, no-stops chase movie with a massive train-wreck scene that's going to have audiences scrambling for cover."

1,"""Fearless"" is like a short story that shines a bright light, briefly, into a corner where you usually do not look."
1,"Bridges turns in another in what has become an astoundingly long list of brilliant performances. Using the simplest means imaginable, he steps into a role as nonchalantly as he might slip into his trousers."
1,"There are times when ""Fearless"" really soars, thanks to bouts of good writing by Rafael Yglesias and direction by Peter Weir and a stellar performance by Bridges."
1,Mr. Bridges does well with a difficult role.
0,"As often with Weir, there's considerably less here than meets the eye."
1,"Bridges is fine, especially in the ethereal early moments, and manages throughout to convey an altered state of mind that rivets the viewer."
1,"Fearless is the rare commercial movie that raises more questions than it answers. You leave it in an altered state yourself--moved, not quite satisfied, but certain you've seen something out of the ordinary."
0,The ghost of Stepin Fetchit is hovering in the tropical ether.
1,"A wholesome, engaging, frequently hilarious, ultimately inspirational film."
1,"The considerable warmth, humour and persistence of the cast soon have you rooting for these underdogs."
0,"If you like underdog movies, you might like this one. Especially if you haven't seen very many."
0,Entirely mediocre and forgettable
1,"A cute, buoyant sports fantasy, jolted along by a reggae soundtrack and playfully acted by an appealing cast."
0,Travelogue shots of happy Jamaicans dancing in the sun give way to patronising comedy.
1,"The offbeat, fact-based saga is enlivened by the perfect balance of humor, emotion and insight and should be one of the true sleepers among fall box office releases."
1,"Cool Runnings is a charming tale of determined underdogs, with plenty of laughs, moments of real tension, and five engaging performances."
1,"Though it certainly has faults, which only the extremely nostalgic could ignore, the film bests its contemporaries through its ability to unite childlike comedy and adult concerns without ever obscuring one with the other."
1,"[A] sweet-natured, high-spirited comedy, that rare movie that plays effectively to all ages."
0,A rather stagy and creaky early talkie (1931) by Alfred Hitchcock.
0,"Mr. Galsworthy's narrative is bound to enlist one's attention, but Mr. Hitchcock, who is responsible for the adaptation as well as the direction, cannot be said to have accomplished either task in a fashion the subject deserves."
1,"The playing is exceptional, both men and women."
1,"The plot [of the play] is too closely knit and the action too localized to make the best cinematographic material. Mr. Hitchcock, however, has used his imagination in translating the play into the terms of the screen."
0,Here is a sad movie with a funny movie inside trying to get out.
0,The warmth that might have made this film work never materializes and slickness is no substitute.
0,"The melodramatics in this picture are tediously uninspired. Since definitions are in order, let's label Impact a dull thud."
1,"The bare story itself could be simplistic and silly: Cops chasing a couple of kids on a horse. But when relationships are involved, and social realities, and a certain level of magical realism, then the story grows and deepens until it really involves us."

0,"Even with all the leggings and horses and medieval gear, Walt Disney's ""The Three Musketeers"" looks more like a beach-party movie than an adaptation of a beloved classic."
0,"It must have been great fun to make it (what young actor doesn't want to dash around on horseback and engage in swashbuckling swordfights?), but it's not that much fun to watch. It's all sound and energy, without plan or meaning."
0,"Conceived frankly as a product, complete with hit-to-be theme song over the closing credits, this adventure film cares less about storytelling than about keeping the Musketeers' feathered hats on straight whenever they go galloping."
0,"Those who have never seen a previous ""Musketeers"" adaptation or a truly exciting Hollywood adventure in the grand style may be swept along, but the mechanical, paint-by-numbers feel of this outing is too evident to ignore."
0,"[A] sound adaptation of the famous tale, hewing closely to the story and its buddy aspect."
0,"All this nonsense would be news to Dumas, whose grave is surely spinning as his musketeers - sucked dry of high drama and low wit - go kicking and screaming into the wonderful world of Disney."
0,"Gunmen is a movie without plan, inspiration or originality - and to that list I would add coherence, except that I am not sure this movie would place much value on a plot that hangs together."
0,"Gunmen, at the very least, does moviegoers the favor of instantly revealing how stupid and cheesy it is, thus sparing us the elevated expectations of fun."
0,[A] witless action movie.
1,"Sarafian is an unpretentious, easy-to-please director, with an eye for quirky character detail and a dab hand at the macho stuff."

1,"This combination of whimsy, sports, religious faith and romance is a heart-warming and edifying amalgam which can pass the test of what is traditionally termed entertainment"
1,"Clarence Brown has carved a tremendously satisfying filmization from a script that, from every evidence, could have gone completely haywire if handled clumsily, dealing as it does with fantasy."
0,
1,"Heaven and Earth has the epic scope one would expect from a film of this magnitude, but it lacks much of the narrative strength of Stone's first two Vietnamese tales."
1,"This is the first time [Stone] has tried to place himself inside a woman's imagination, and that he succeeds so well is due partly...to an extraordinary performance by Hiep Thi Le in the leading role."
0,"Heaven has so many themes, ranging from Buddhist spirituality to feminism, it ends up with none."
0,"Mr. Stone tells this tale vigorously, but he has the wrong cinematic vocabulary for his heroine's essentially passive experience."
0,
0,Some of the parts are undeniably gripping; what gets lost are the characters themselves.
1,"Like many of the Disney films, from Pinocchio to Fantasia, this film is a cinematic rite of passage -- for children and adults."
1,"To one degree or another, every animated feature made since owes it something."
1,"It is a classic, as important cinematically as The Birth of a Nation or the birth of Mickey Mouse."
1,"...the animation itself is top-notch, and in a number of darker sequences (Snow White's terrified entry into the forest, for example), Disney's adoption of Expressionist visual devices makes for genuinely powerful drama."
1,"So perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness."
1,"You've probably seen it 15 times by now, so why not make it 16?"
1,To say of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that it is among the genuine artistic achievements of this country takes no great daring.
1,The film is as charming as it is novel in conception and execution and it is so bound to appeal as strongly to grown-ups as to youngsters.

0,"I didn't much care, for two reasons: Thumbelina's woe-is-me act got old real fast, and I couldn't care less about her matrimonial prospects."
1,"Not necessarily for young kids, this is a surrealist version with a great deal of attention accorded to objects."
1,"It takes us back to a time in the history of movies when audiences responded to the images on screen with a combination of awe and fear, when in submitting to them, we felt as if we were submitting to a spell."
1,"Though [Jan Svankmajer] strips away all sweetness and light, he does not violate Lewis Carroll's story."
1,The definitive version of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
1,Its glorious proliferation of magical transformations works like a charm on anyone who values the imagination.
0,"Some would consider this version better than the 1971 remake with Charlton Heston, The Omega Man, but that isn't much of an achievement."
0,
0,"What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie."

1,"Thompson, also making her directorial debut, is undaunted by would-be neigh-sayers."
1,"Stalwart, evocative and in every respect passable ..."
0,"Assuming a good picture is one that transcends its own material -- pulls in a variety of people with no special interest in the subject -- then ""Black Beauty"" is a lumbering candidate for the glue factory."
0,It plays like a cross between New Age mysticism and anthropomorphism run amok.
1,
1,"This level of equine empathy takes getting used to, but it's worth the trouble. Ms. Thompson's film may be precious, but it's also rapturously pretty and filled with surprising passion."
1,"Directing her first feature, screenwriter Caroline Thompson adopts a level-headed tone, avoiding the twin traps of sentimentality and sermonising."
1,"Although already filmed three times in the sound era, Black Beauty has never been put onscreen faithfully or well, a situation partially remedied by this affecting, rather grave rendition of the children's perennial."
1,Innovative and timelessly hilarious.
1,"It's a brilliant combination of light and darkness, tenderness and violence and, yes, laughter and tears."
1,"There's an edge to The Circus that suggests a man gazing deep into the void, laughing at the darkness and urging us to do the same."
0,"[Charles Chaplin] does not seem satisfied with the hearty laughs that used to greet him, but seeks to embroider his farce with touches of pathos that make one uncomfortable with their incongruity."
1,"There is less pure horse-play in The Kid than in the other Chaplins. The comedian depends chiefly upon his inimitable pantomime, and it scores every time."
1,"As always, Chaplin's opulent Victorian sentimentality is made palatable both by the amazing grace of his pantomimic skills and the balancing presence of harsh reality."
1,"While it will move people to uproarious laughter and keep them in a state of uneasing delight, it also will touch their hearts and win sympathy, not only for the star, but for his leading woman, and little Jackie Coogan."
1,"It was Chaplin's first full-length film, and the action is perhaps too episodic; he hadn't yet mastered the structural demands of the long form. But several of the episodes... are sublime."
1,To my mind The Kid is by long odds the best motion picture comedy ever made. It has more than humor; it has tenderness and literary charm. Incidentally it is the first child picture I ever saw that did not give me an acute pain to the bowels.
1,Formerly it was the custom to say that Mr. Chaplin played down to the level of his audiences. Now it is to be hoped that he will lift his audiences up to this new level of his own.
1,The story is only of the average order... [but] the quality of the film lies in the joyous fooling of Chaplin and the Kid.

1,"Even without the state-of-the-art, boundary-busting computerized effects from Industrial Light & Magic, Carrey's a human cartoon, and his spontaneous, Avery-esque, anything-for-a-laugh outrageousness makes this otherwise blank Mask a must-see."
0,Doesn't have any more material than a Tex Avery cartoon.
1,"The Mask is a perfect vehicle for the talents of Jim Carrey, who underwhelmed me with Ace Ventura, Pet Detective but here seems to have found a story and character that work together with manic energy."
0,"As a comedy, The Mask is genial, but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof."
1,Exuberant fun.
1,"Carrey is the ultimate party dude, and like the masked man says, this party is smokin'."
0,"Bright-eyed, crazily intense, irrepressibly silly, Mr. Carrey can be funny without fireworks. He deserves material clever enough to let him do just that."
1,"The design is bright as a button and the transformation scenes real eye-poppers, but the film's best special effect is putty-faced Carrey with his razzle-dazzle star turn as the affable Stanley and his manic alter ego."
1,"The results are easy to watch, though awfully familiar and simpleminded."
1,"Adroitly directed, viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun."
0,"Carrey now has the clout to find a vehicle worthy of his hyperactive gooniness. When he does, we'll see if he's truly a jester for our time or simply the moron of the moment."
1,"When his face turns green and his limbs get limber, Carrey's pretty much unstoppable. This cartoon-y creation is an amazing fusion of physical comedy and state-of-the- art cinema illusion."
1,"The gangland plot is flimsy (bad guy Peter Greene wears too much eyeliner), and the jokes are erratic, but it's a far better showcase for Carrey's comic-from-Uranus talent than Ace Ventura."
1,"Carrey and his aggressive overbite are back, but this time he's better used as an ingredient instead of as the plot."
1,"If a movie star was born in Ace Ventura, he is christened in The Mask. Quite simply, this is the best and freest crazy comedy to come along since Beetlejuice."
1,"Not only is he adept at physical humor, the kind of knockabout stuff that recalls the classic silent clowns, but Carrey also has a bright and likable screen presence, a lost puppy quality that is surprisingly endearing."

0,"Nichols has allowed Wolf to evolve from a well-mounted, supernatural drama to goofy camp."
0,Monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience; this one fails utterly in that arena.
1,"A sometimes shaky, always enchanting Beauty and the Beast story for grown-ups that is the very essence of smart fun -- droll, sophisticated and surprisingly, pleasingly light."
1,It's a wonderfully entertaining and beautifully performed film.
1,"An effective attempt to place a werewolf story in an incongruous setting, with the closely observed details of that setting used to make the story seem more believable."
1,Nichols has crafted a rapturous romantic thriller with a darkly comic subtext about what kills human values.
0,"If he'd followed through, Mike Nichols might have made a brilliant picture -- seems he just couldn't bear to look a gift wolf in the mouth."
1,"The film isn't a waste of time, and works rather well for about two- thirds of its length as a comedy of business life. For a horror film or a serious exploration of the divided nature of modern man, you need to look elsewhere."
0,Drab photography and over-footage devoted to long gloomy hallways make for repetition.
1,"Most of the plot is worked out adroitly, but there is one unnecessary mechanical twist, which is employed detract from part of the horror."
1,Its most enduring quality is Veidt's tormented performance as Orlac.
0,"Most of the time, you won't be chuckling, so much as contemplating the emptiness that lies in the brains of all too many production executives."
0,Overproduced but underwhelming monolith.
0,The setup promises something more invigorating than it delivers.
1,"If you respond to film noir, if you like dark streets and women with scarlet lips and big fast cars with running boards, the look of this movie will work some kind of magic."
0,"This thing is all packaging and no content, or, dare I say it, all shadow and no substance."
1,"It offers a diverting, nostalgic retreat to the innocent days when crime fighting was a pleasant, rich man's hobby."
0,"Baldwin's low-key performance lacks charisma, Lone alternates between lip-smacking villainy and camp humour, and Miller is chiefly a clothes-horse for a series of slinky '30s frocks."
1,It has enough of the innocent exoticism and splendor of silent thrillers to suggest a continuity with the past missing from most other movies; all that's required is a capacity to sit back and dream.
0,"Despite similarities as a vigilante creature of the night, however, the Shadow -- a character that enjoyed its greatest success in radio after being created in pulp novels -- lacks the visceral appeal of Batman and won't strike the same chord."
0,The movie has all the coherence of a bad acid flashback.
1,
1,"In the end, It Could Happen to You is a lot like the cop and the waitress: sweet, naive, not too smart, but likable."
1,"If you're looking for a late summer, ""feel good"" romantic comedy, there aren't too many around more affable than this one."
1,"Bergman never goes for heavy-handed schmaltz, and the whole movie has the same lighthearted big city spirit as the New York Post headlines that follow the story."
1,"Simply and without pandering or insults to your intelligence, the movie delivers more of the old-style pleasures of moviegoing than any other picture in a long while."
0,"The nastiness in the movie feels derived from life, while all the niceness feels canned -- imported from old Jimmy Stewart pictures."
0,"Sweetness is fine as far as it goes, but this oddball romance could have used a twist of lemon."
0,"Perez has a field day as Muriel, injecting a welcome note of good old-fashioned greed into what is otherwise a relentlessly edifying story."
1,"Bergman...really brings home the homage to Capra with the pic's warm, bordering-on-irresistible finale."
0,Smuttiness is made coy; innocence is made dirty; boyhood sexuality is made into a cartoon.
0,Question: Will Hollywood ever retire the Hooker With a Heart of Gold?
0,"A preposterous movie about a boy, a babe and a car, all of them functioning minimally in what is essentially a showcase for Melanie Griffith's body."
0,Some movies just don't know when enough is enough.
0,"I don't want to spoil it for you, but let's just say the gangster doesn't get what he wants, and true love saves the day."
0,"Richard Benjamin, laboring under the idea that this is an enchanting premise, directs such episodes as if he were Norman Rockwell in a trenchcoat."
0,"This feelgood romantic comedy is short on laughs, sexual chemistry, and the thriller subplot won't produce any white knuckles."
0,"With a tip of the hat to the performers, this is a misguided comedy with Hall of Shame pedigree. Its commercial prospects are quick, down and dirty."
0,"John Mattson's script is every bit as silly as it sounds; it dawdles, stumbles, stalls, embarrasses both itself and the audience, and is routinely formulaic to boot."
0,Only the least demanding audiences can be expected to buy into Milk Money.
1,"This pleasant, unassuming little comedy manages to overcome its many potential shortcomings."

1,"This film is the distillation of an intriguing blend of romantic comedy, satire, drama, and philosophy."
1,"It appears at first to be about the casual lives of young men trying to launch their careers, but eventually ... it reveals darker depths and meanings."
1,"Stillman pulls confident, polished performances from all his actors."
0,Ted and Fred may finally leave you not caring about Stillman's protagonists -- not so much ugly Americans as mildly unpleasant Americans.
1,"A remarkable find: The film doesn't stop at getting your attention, it rewards it."
1,"Slyly hilarious, esthetically sound and spiritually restorative."
1,"The prickly, conservative, jacket-and-tie iconoclasm of Barcelona is like nothing else around."
1,"This is fairly amusing stuff-brittle, fresh, and impudent - if you can stomach all the upscale arrogance."
1,An exquisitely composed yet fiercely combative satire (set in the eighties) of European mores as seen through the eyes of two young exemplars of the American establishment.

0,"Director Norman Jewison meant ""Only You"" to be ""Moonstruck"" with a heavier Italian accent, but the star-crossed couple are only about half-moonstruck in this stale valentine."
0,
1,"It is total fantasy, light as a feather, contrary to all notions of common sense... and it takes place mostly in Venice, Rome, and the glorious Italian hillside town of Positano. What more do you want?"
0,Only You isn't much more than target marketing for the Sleepless in Seattle crowd.
1,"Mr. Jewison takes a voluptuously cornball approach to this story. And the story itself, by Diane Drake, is actually rather sweet."
1,"Even so, the ravishing visuals, some swooning love songs, and the strains of Verdi should see you through to the predictably moist ending."
1,"Jewison knows exactly where the laugh and welling-up buttons are that will hook the audience into this middle-class fairy-tale-come-true, and has smartly cast it with engaging personalities."
0,"Movies like Only You and its obvious model, Sleepless in Seattle, are less true romances than they are collections of romantic signifiers."
0,"""Only You"" plays more like a pleasant travelogue than an involving film."
0,
0,This movie is excruciatingly dumb.
0,"With all the preening, posing and stretching, it's hard to know if The Specialist is an action movie or an exercise video."
0,"The Specialist is one of those films that forces the characters through torturous mazes of dialogue and action, to explain a plot that is so unlikely it's not worth the effort."
0,"This movie is a stinker in every way, from the one-dimensional acting to the idiot dialogue to the surprisingly monotonous storyline."

1,"There are many strengths, including the cinematography, sound design and a hauntingly allusive score."
1,"After next March, new editions of the book will boast a different kind of label - one that says 'Now an Oscar-winning motion picture.'"
1,"It's heartfelt, praiseworthy and amazingly faithful to Toni Morrison's complex Pulitzer Prize-winning novel!"
1,Moves in leisurely fits and -- unencumbered by style or narrative complexity -- never loses its forward momentum.
1,"It is an urgently intimate epic of the heart, a dramatization of a monumental journey of pain, love and, tentatively, hope that has scorching emotional impact."
1,"Beloved is a movie that swims in your bloodstream, echoes through your bones!"
1,A powerful and disturbing motion picture!
0,"This screeching, grotesque display of shattered human dignity is about as subtle as five or ten thousand kicks in the head from a mule, with the kicks getting exceedingly baroque as the movie progresses."
0,"Everywhere you look in Beloved are signs of Demme's decay as a director -- the inattention to performances, the grindingly slow pacing, the sloppy, at times incoherent, story line and the straining grandiloquence of the tone."
1,Demme succeeds uncannily well in bringing the novel's pulse to the screen.
0,"A dense, jangled cataclysm of enigma and outrage."
1,"I was sometimes confused about events as they happened, but all the pieces are there, and the film creates an emotional whole."
1,Beloved has power and impressive artistry to spare!
1,A remarkable movie!
1,
1,"The elaborate, soaring Beloved may alight on the ground with a tap rather than a thud, but land it does, after a harrowing, breathtaking flight."
1,"Like a great book, Beloved builds up, through accretion of detail, so much information and revelation that we begin to live the lives with these people."
0,An overlong misfire that has only flashes of staggering power.
1,"Once this film gets its bearings, the unsentimental fierceness of its vision brushes obstacles and quibbles from its path."
1,A knot of fierce emotions that is left for the viewer to untangle. Make the effort.
1,"Demme's potent adaptation of Morrison's novel may be substantial, but it is also engrossing."
1,"Something rare: a brave film about the emotional toll of slavery, the anguish of memory and the cruel divisions that still sear African American lives."
1,A movie that requires the viewer to meet it halfway. Those willing to make the effort will be rewarded with an exquisitely photographed and intricately layered drama.
1,"Everything epic that Legends of the Fall strains so hard to achieve, Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book accomplishes niftily."
1,"The special effects are convincing, the performances are forthright, and the direction, by Stephen Sommers, recalls his energetic, lighthearted ""The Adventures of Huck Finn"" (1993)."
1,"Beautifully photographed and tightly paced with a spate of solid performances, this latest Kipling-inspired motion picture is an enjoyable and exuberant film-going experience."
1,"The narrative shifts from romance to adventure the way Cheetah used to hop from foot to foot, but Sommers nevertheless delivers a bully family picture."
1,A chaste teen-age love story with an ecological sensibility and some terrific scenery.
1,"Scott Lee is an unexpectedly appealing hero, partly because he's never indulged, and his dialogue is kept to a minimum."
1,"Kipling purists may not cotton to Disney's new live-action version of The Jungle Book, but it's hard to think of anyone else who won't be enchanted."
1,"A full-throttled, technically superb adventure - with more bite than most Disney live-action fare - that offers some winning moments but, ultimately, isn't as involving as it needs to be."
0,Rent the animated film instead.
1,Jungle Book entertains in a way both contemporary and traditional.
0,The new attempt - a live-action adaptation - is unlikely to supplant the cartoon version in anyone's affections.
0,"That's the biggest problem with this Jungle Book. Sommers is so busy spinning his camera, crowding the soundtrack with animal noises and piling on the cheesy visual effects that he can't stop for a reflective moment or a character-revealing touch."
1,"This Jungle Book, however, is more remindful of Disney's classic wildlife adventure pics than it is of a cartoon, and it is most remindful of that other jungle classic, Tarzan."
0,There's little here for those who know the story.
0,
1,"It's goofy and ridiculous and preposterous, and yet it makes you feel good, and there is something oddly heartwarming about the sight of this macho guy melting with feelings of protectiveness and maternal concern."
1,"As a comedy, Junior has its share of laughs -- but no more than its share."
0,Junior demands more range from its leading man than he's capable of giving. The predictable result is a big-budget mess more likely to elicit groans than laughter.
0,"For the right audience, Junior may deliver. But there's a whole lot of pregnancy to go through first."
1,"A fleecy romantic caper with a dusting of feminism, the picture is basically a one-joke movie successfully nursed by director Ivan Reitman."
1,The plot is a more fertile ground for comedy than the 'sperm milkshake' that made Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito brothers in Reitman's Twins.
1,"A happy, healthy, bouncing baby of a movie."
1,"The wait pays off. When the Big Guy starts showing, and begins to get that radiant glow, Junior hits its mellow, endearing comic stride."

0,"While de Souza's arrested development makes him a likely suspect to adapt a video game for movies, the result (like The Super Mario Brothers movie before it) is an empty exercise in hyper-stimulation. Or, to put it bluntly, a complete waste of time."
0,"De Souza's wit, which gave his earlier action scripts a tart edge, has failed him here. He pitches this entire movie at the sub-literate set that, with glassy eyes, unthinkingly pumps quarter after quarter into video games."
0,"This is [Steven E. de Souza's] directorial debut, and while it shows promise, it is uneven. The film is way too choppy, and as a result we never get a chance to know the characters (except Bison)."
1,It's the performances ... that make this movie special.

1,"If you can't get the man (or boy) in your life to budge, have a girls' night out with Little Women, and leave 'em guessing at what you enjoyed so much."
1,"Alcott's sense, sensibility and sentiment find new life in this handcrafted valentine."
1,By and large it's immensely well done.
1,
0,"The situation is contrived, the relationships unlikely, the characters one-dimensional."
0,[The characters] become less and less interesting as the movie progresses.
1,The three ... especially Fox--do well.
1,Boyle's cool manner and the performances ultimately ratchet Shallow Grave past the ranks of standard thriller fare.
0,"Since no reasonable person can remotely hope to identity with Juliet, David or Alex, the whole case drops through."
1,A reasonably enjoyable (for those captivated by this sort of thing) black comedy/noir thriller.
1,"A tight little thriller, filled with exhilarating twists, that quickly establishes its artistic contract with the audience."
0,"Fox, McGregor and Eccleston merely mill around the screen like the kind of living-dead folks we usually see rising from the grave."
0,"Class has its place, but some of us prefer our cut-'em-ups a little more lowdown."
1,A savagely entertaining neo-film noir.
1,
0,"The violence in the film, in particular, is briskly and harshly managed, without either half-heartedness or gloating. But a little further along, cogency starts falling apart for good."
1,"Danny Boyle does wonders with a small budget, and the suave, dense-hued look of his movie stays with you long after the horror has evaporated."
0,
1,"The plot moves like clockwork, surprising us, then surprising us again, but I liked Bad Company more for its style, look and feel."
0,
1,"Visually and emotionally, this is the director's warmest film."
1,"Red is not a movie by a filmmaker who has run out of ideas, but one by an artist at the height of his powers."
1,In this final installment of a glorious trilogy ... [Kieslowski] has saved his greatest for last.
1,A subtle masterpiece.
1,"Jacob is so good in the role, so effective at suggesting a mingling of innocence and intuition, that it's easy to imagine why Red was written with her in mind."
1,This is the kind of film that makes you feel intensely alive while you're watching it.
1,What makes Red watchable is Kieslowski's arresting visual sense.
1,"Undaunted by the tremendous emotional and moral valence he has by now invited us to expect, Kieslowski controls the film magnificently, putting to use the shapely formal precision he took an entire career to work out."
1,Red succeeds so stirringly that it also bestows some much-needed magic upon its predecessors.
1,"Stunningly beautiful, powerfully scored and immaculately performed, the film is virtually flawless, and one of the very greatest cinematic achievements of the last few decades. A masterpiece."
1,"Another deft, deeply affecting variation on Krzysztof Kieslowski's recurring theme that people are interconnected in ways they can barely fathom."
1,The third and best feature of Krzysztof Kieslowski's highly ambitious Three Colors trilogy.
1,"For all its cleverness, remains in essence the story of a friendship which, across the generations, leaves both parties a little easier with themselves but still prey to fate."
1,"Is it profound or is it facile? When a movie gives you goose bumps, it may not matter."
1,"The key figure in L'Enfer is Nelly, the wife. Paul is almost a hopeless case even from the first frames, sliding beyond jealousy into insanity. But what about her? Surely she knows how sick her husband is?"
1,"Whatever its faults, it is humble, adult fare and welcome in this age of grandiose children's games."
1,"So eloquently straightforward, it practically sings to the soul."
1,"The intelligent sensitivity of the script, coupled with Newman's powerfully understated performance, make this motion picture special."
1,It benefits from the confidence of Newman's performance.
1,This is a feel-good flick that doesn't look like one -- it's smart enough to hide its smooth polish beneath a scuffed-up veneer.
1,It's a gem.
1,"It says everything about Mr. Newman's performance, the single best of this year and among the finest he has ever given, that you never stop to wonder how a guy as good-looking as Paul Newman ended up this way."
1,Benton's quietly superb adaptation of Richard Russo's novel is one of those movies you thought they didn't make anymore.
1,"By giving his movie a very effective realistic look, by helping his actors to shape strongly believable performances, even when they are doing implausible things, Benton lends credence to...inspirational fibs."
1,"Fronted by a splendid performance from Paul Newman... Robert Benton's character-driven film is sprinkled with small pleasures; the dramatic developments here don't take place in the noisy, calamitous manner that is customary these days."
1,"Not much of a plot? Don't be fooled. The best thing about a story so subdued, so contained -- at least when it's done well, and Fool is done exceptionally well -- is that, in the quiet, we can really hear the characters breathe."
1,The movie is both a star vehicle and an ensemble piece; the other actors revolve around Newman yet give off more than just his reflected light.
1,"We love to see our movie gods play flawed souls, especially a god with a face that looks like one on a Roman coin."
1,Moviegoing holds few pleasures greater than watching an established star completely inhabit a role that exactly suits his personality and abilities. And seeing Paul Newman in Nobody's Fool defines that pleasure.
1,Nobody's Fool is funny at times and as cuddly as an old teddy bear. But this movie is being taken far too seriously in some circles.
1,"While watching Robert Benton's sublime adaptation of Richard Russo's novel, it's hard to avoid the realization that movies like this have become an endangered species."
1,The principal pleasure of this film directed by Robert Benton is that its characters are carefully drawn and developed rather than applied like so many decals on a two- dimensional wintry landscape.
1,"For better and for worse, it's still a Hollywood movie (and a white boys' movie to boot), but one with a more alert eye and feeling for American life than most of its competitors."
1,Seeing this restored version is like understanding the film at last... It makes all the difference in the world.
1,"The director was one of the very few filmmakers who could create a world that, however nastier or more brutish than the one we live in, never felt smaller or less complex."
1,"Not only does The Wild Bunch illustrate Peckinpah's mastery of his medium, but it presents a story that is effective on nearly every level."
1,"A true cinematic touchstone, the film has influenced a generation of movie makers, from Scorsese to Tarantino to Hong Kong action king John Woo."
1,"The Wild Bunch takes the basic elements of the Western movie myth, which once defined a simple, morally comprehensible world, and by bending them turns them into symbols of futility and aimless corruption."
1,"In purely cinematic terms, the film is a savagely beautiful spectacle, Lucien Ballard's superb cinematography complementing Peckinpah's darkly elegiac vision."
0,"Film at 145 minutes is far over-length, and should be tightened extensively, particularly in first half."
1,"The on-screen carnage established a new level in American movies, but few of the films that followed in its wake could duplicate Peckinpah's depth of feeling."
1,Arguably the strongest Hollywood movie of the 1960s -- a western that galvanizes the clich챕s of its dying genre with a shocking jolt of delirious carnage.
1,"In an era when body-count films mirror the mounting body count offscreen, The Wild Bunch dissects death rather than glorifying it."
1,"The Wild Bunch is an American masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever produced in the Hollywood system."
1,"It is certainly one of the best westerns ever made, and the best film of any kind to come out in 1969."
1,It's a towering achievement that grows more riveting and resonant with the years.
1,"The Wild Bunch is Peckinpah's most complex inquiry into the metamorphosis of man into myth. Not incidentally, it is also a raucous, violent, powerful feat of American film making."
1,"It's a traumatic poem of violence, with imagery as ambivalent as Goya's."
0,"Underneath the movie, which is set on the eve of World War I, there's an elegiac plangency that stays with you long after the shocks have worn off...The Wild Bunch still won't go down easy."
1,"Remains hugely impressive, both for its technical brilliance and the emotional ferocity of its themes: old age, friendship, betrayal and the struggle to retain some kind of cock-eyed code of honour in an increasingly cynical world."
0,"If you must see The Wild Bunch, be sure to take along a barf bag."
0,"Although Stone may be pleasing to some eyes, she's pretty small in the saddle here -- just an innocuous gender twist on the reluctant cowboy hero. And her story of hellbent revenge is about as compelling as a 30-second fragrance commercial."
0,"As preposterous as the plot was, there was never a line of Hackman dialogue that didn't sound as if he believed it. The same can't be said, alas, for Sharon Stone..."
0,"You get lots of clothes here, but no emperor."
0,"Raimi's choice to give the film a comic book-like aura of mingled camp and grit makes for some fitfully energetic and entertaining moments, but it's not enough to overcome The Quick and the Dead's primary fault."
0,"Rarely dull, it is not noticeably compelling either, and as the derivative offshoot of a derivative genre, it inevitably runs out of energy well before any of its hotshots runs out of bullets."
1,"The whole film has tremendous visual style, and the frequent bursts of violence are delivered with a clever and often hilarious use of special effects."
0,"What Raimi can't find is a center. He hankers for us to giggle at the brutal archetypes he's parodying and to warm to them, too. It won't wash, pardner."
1,"Mr. Raimi is limited by a sketch mentality, which means his jokes tend to be over long before his films end. But his tastes for visual mischief and crazy, ill-advised homage can still make for sly, sporadic fun."
1,"A deadpan black comedy, Sam Raimi's fast-paced movie looks and sounds like a Leone oater but more so."
0,The plot of this low-camp revenge thriller is little more than an excuse to line up one badass cowboy (or girl) opposite another and let the eyeball-to-eyeball fireworks fly.
0,"Why, exactly, would you want to make a movie about racist hate groups, and then disguise it as family entertainment about a cute dog?"
0,
0,
0,"It's a shame that the makers of ""Born to Be Wild"" went to such great lengths to create an absolutely convincing gorilla via technical wizardry only to waste their efforts on such a trite, predictable comedy-adventure."
0,The film's biggest mistake is in going after the heartstrings instead of the funnybone.
0,Screenwriters Paul Young and John Bunzel... can't decide whether they're making a slapstick comedy or an impassioned ecological statement or just a harmless baby-sitter...

1,A lost minor classic. Go and rediscover.
1,The film is funny and blood-curdling by turns.
1,A titter-inducing drawing-room farce (but deliberately so).
1,A chilling romp - expertly orchestrated scares with a humorous camp undertow.
1,It is performed with tremendous gusto and theatrical dash.
0,"Carpenter, whose batting average is dipping dangerously low, shows no grasp of character development, plot line or time passage."
0,A trip to a village of the darned tedious.
1,"An enjoyable, if obviously-flawed, amalgamation of horror and science fiction."
1,"A good-looking, well-wrought film with some knockout special effects, some dark humor and crisp portrayals."
0,There's nothing more static than a stalled fright vehicle.
1,There are moments in A Little Princess when you may just want to clap from pleasure.
1,Cuaron's version of magic realism consists of seeing incredibly fanciful sets and situations in precise detail.
1,"A Little Princess exquisitely re-creates the ephemeral world of childhood, an enchanted kingdom where everything, even make-believe, seems possible."
1,"It's not only suitable for consumption by those over age 10, it's actually enjoyable."
0,The 1939 Shirley Temple version of this book came closer to capturing Sara's vitality.
1,"A bright, beautiful and enchantingly childlike vision."
1,An exemplary version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel.
1,"An astonishing work of studio artifice, A Little Princess is that rarest of creations, a children's film that plays equally well to kids and adults."
1,The film uses studio resources to create an entrancing world both in New York and in the heroine's fantasies about India.

0,"This movie is so good-looking it deserves a decent screenplay, instead of one more lope down memory lane."
0,"Bad Boys is relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; it's loud, shallow, sexist and a complete waste of time."
0,"Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end."
0,"Even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks, this one's bad, boys."
1,A good half-hour's worth of nonsense in the middle keeps Bad Boys from being little better than a break- even proposition.
0,"Given how much good Bad Boys is going to do for Martin Lawrence's feature career, it's a pity the film couldn't do any more for itself."
0,It's all special-effects noise and nonsense.
1,"This film isn't aiming for high-toned drama, just high-energy entertainment, which is what it delivers."
0,"Unfortunately, the movie is a couple of rewrites short of 'developed', and the thriller configurations are stale."
1,"Even when it's not particularly funny, their interplay is engaging, and their lively, raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time."
0,"The cops never seem to know what they're doing, but then neither do the filmmakers, though I can't imagine that casual audiences will care since there are plenty of big explosions at the end to reward them."
0,Haven't we seen this all before? Four or five dozen times?
0,"You may rest assured that whenever a glass object hoves into view, it will be shattered in slo-mo by the end of the scene."
0,"Entertainment of the gratingly commercial, teeth-rattling variety is provided in Bad Boys."

1,... the pairing of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith generates a winning comic chemistry.

1,"The movie is a delicate creation, with no big punch line or payoff. Watching it, I was in the moment: It was about these people wandering lost through their lives. Afterward, I felt good about them."

1,"Taking advantage of the studio's breathtakingly intricate animation, directors Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg have breathed vitality into this, the fifth 'new wave' Disney animated picture."
1,"Pocahontas is the best-looking of the modern Disney animated features, and one of the more thoughtful: It is about real issues, even if it treats them with naive idealism."
1,"Imagine a cult Disney cartoon, for this may be it."
0,"Adult viewers, spoiled by what has come before, may feel that this film, which relates the legendary romance between a chief's daughter and English adventurer John Smith in the New World, is more by-the-numbers than inspired."
1,"Disney deserves praise for raising the ante on its ambitions in animation. Next time, though, a little less civics lesson and a little more heart."
1,"Disney's 33rd animated feature, and its first with characters based on real people, is a stunning movie with clever twists, vivid characterizations, insightful songs and a surprising harvest of revisionist history."
1,Any damage such revisionist history may impose on young minds is offset by the honestly inspiring thoughts Pocahontas offers.
0,"Pocahontas can't get stirred dramatically for political correctness, the finale will please nobody, and the songs are duff. That said, there are enough incidental felicities to pass the time pleasantly."
0,Why make a Disney cartoon and take all the fun out of it?
1,The Disney artists have created a vivid palette for the picture.
1,"Just about everything in this lavish, animated feature is for the pigtail set."
1,"[A] handsome, deeply felt, even more deeply reverent animated musical."
1,Overall this seems like a reasonable stab at an impossible agenda.
0,All Disney has really done in its disappointing 33rd animated feature is revive the stereotype of the Noble Savage.
1,"The film may take you by surprise with its quick ending, running only 76 minutes before the credits roll. I wanted more both times I saw it."

1,A silk purse among children's entertainment.
1,"A hilarious fantasy, about a plucky piglet that learns how to tend sheep, Babe is a barnyard charmer."
1,"Babe is a movie made with charm and wit, and unlike some family movies it does not condescend, not for a second."
1,"Through a mixture of imaginative storytelling, impressive animatronics, and irresistible cuteness, Babe casts a spell over all viewers -- young, old, or somewhere in between."
1,"The movie, directed by Chris Noonan, who wrote the screenplay with George Miller, takes a child's-eye view of a world that is photographed to look like a storybook come to life."
1,The underlying tricks are never allowed to upstage the story in all its humble sweetness.
1,"If only people would be more like these animals, the world, though hardly saner, would certainly be a lot more fun."
1,"A lovely, intelligent gem of G-rated entertainment that is also rib-tickling funny."
1,"Charming, eccentric and very amusing."
1,It has a surprising charm.
1,"Australian director Chris Noonan and producer George Miller show what real talent and imagination can do, even without big-name humans as costars."
1,"The characters (both animal and human) are solidly conceived, and the storytelling and visuals are expertly fashioned."
1,A dazzling family entertainment with enormous charm that utilizes breathtaking technical innovation.
1,"Babe is not, strictly speaking, a kid's movie. It is a preposterously funny fable that strikes a chord with adults, too."
1,"For children, the movie will play like a storybook come to life. Adults, at first, will marvel at the special effects and puppetry. But ultimately, they'll be won over by the nuances of a story that finds a fresh way to deliver a timeless message."
1,A film that is exceptional in its technical effects and its graceful ability to entertain.
1,"[It's] a comedy of animal manners that is much funnier and much cannier than any recent movie about human relationships: a lovely, stubbornly idiosyncratic fable of aspiration and survival."
1,"He's brave and bright, good-natured and ambitious, naive and vulnerable. All in all, he's probably the most winsome orphan to appear on the screen since Freddie Bartholomew impersonated David Copperfield 60 years ago."
1,"Thanks to well-trained live animals, clever voice characterizations and a big dash of muppetry from Henson's Creature Shop, Babe and his barnyard friends not only walk the walk and trot the trot, they also talk the talk."
1,"Here's the summer's sleeper for kids and their parents, a terrific picture that takes a lot of risks and makes them all pay off in a charming story about a pig who fancies himself a sheepdog -- or sheep-pig."
1,"Much to my surprise, I found Babe charming in an eccentric, oddly tough-minded sort of way. And if it isn't quite good enough to change my mind about the entire critter-chat genre, it is certainly good enough to recommend."

1,It takes a real star to make suffering this sexy.
1,"Gibson's raw energy and storytelling power in Braveheart are undeniable. If the film doesn't meet his ambitions, it's because he set the bar so high."
0,"Braveheart opts to turn cowardly, settling for the magnification of Gibson's idol status, forfeiting the complex, more nebulous magnificence of the real Sir William Wallace and virtually excising the strategic brilliance of Robert The Bruce."
0,Everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars' contracts. Too bad there isn't one banning self-indulgence when they direct.
1,"With its clashing armies, heartstopping action, and grand sense of romance, this is the sort of film it's a pleasure to see and review."
1,[Gibson] has created a completely adequate modern facsimile of the classic romantic epic.
0,A rambling disappointment.
1,An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of The Road Warrior.
0,At times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo.
1,"As far as a good old-fashioned story of historical oppression goes, it does sweep you up and entertain."
1,"Though lumpy and even redundant, Braveheart constantly rebounds on some bold note."
1,One of the most spectacular entertainments in years.
1,"As a filmmaker, [Gibson] lacks the epic gift, but the movie, scripted by Randall (no relation) Wallace, works on a fairly basic level as a hiss-the-English medieval Western."
1,"Though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery, dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess, the action will pin you to your seat."
0,Pure hokum.
1,Braveheart is a huge historical epic directed by Gibson with a well-balanced blend of romantic and documentary styles.
1,"A huge, bloody and sprawling epic, Braveheart is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver."
1,"In this mix of historical tragedy and hip adventure, Gibson may be as galvanic a movie swashbuckler as Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster were in their day."
1,"The political argument that ensues is pretty dull, but the battle scenes are the loudest and most convincing in years: Gibson has learned from Kurosawa in lending a clarifying thrust to what is, essentially, chaos."
1,"As the star of the new, epic-scaled Braveheart, Gibson celebrates yet another man of selfless valor. And as its director, he displays some daring of his own."
1,"A lavish, entertaining spectacle full of manly men, dastardly villains, rousing battles and women who easily see Mel's hero potential through all that messy hair."
1,"In addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago."
1,"Mel Gibson throws his whole heart into a role. No one acts with more conviction, and his errors are honest ones."
1,"Braveheart has a gut-wrenching, bone-breaking, sword-thwacking verve."
1,Many movies deal with battlefield heroics. Few seriously attempt to define heroism.
0,"In the absence of satisfying moral dilemmas, Braveheart is an action film with an unhappy ending rather than the tragedy it would like to be."
1,"Braveheart is a big, strapping medieval sword-and-arrow movie with more fighting than romance, a surprising abundance of lush and sensuous imagery considering its brutal strife, and Gibson fiercely inciting it to stand up and march."
1,
0,"Copycat, despite two tough-babe leads to kill for, flies in more directions than scattered kitty litter."
1,"Copycat doesn't have the dark tones of Seven, or that movie's distinctive look. But in its own way, it is as effective. It creates original characters and makes them more important than the plot. We care, and that's the key."

0,The picture's period furnishings include Hester's 17th-century hot tub.
0,Students beware: This is no sub for Cliffs Notes. The script takes more liberties with the text than Elizabeth Berkley did with that pole in Showgirls.
0,"Literary purists will be aghast at some of the liberties taken with the original text, but my complaints have more to do with cinematic misjudgments than with those in the book-to-screen translation."
0,"The movie has removed the character's sense of guilt, and therefore the story's drama."
0,"Though it's unclear what the audience would be for a faithful rendition of the Hawthorne novel, the question of who would ever want to see this one is murkier still."
1,"This is a well-acted, beautiful movie."
0,"If you've read the book you won't know the ending. Let's just say that Indians with flaming arrows come to the rescue. They manage to keep a straight face, which is more than anyone in the audience will be able to do."
0,"Not only does the film bear little resemblance to the source novel, but it's cluttered with ridiculous symbolism."
0,"A very '90s take on a 1660s tale written in 1850, as a picture of early colonial life it's about as convincing as Pocahontas."

1,"With her keen actor's instincts, Foster piles on plenty for her terrific cast to chew on and for us to savor."
0,"Foster and Richter, of course, want to do more than make audiences laugh; they want us to be touched by their characters' humanity and take an interest in a budding romance, but that rarely is the case."
0,"Foster keeps the party hopping, although more dark humor would have helped before she winds it down with sentiment and bromides."
1,"Neither caustic nor sentimental, it's a film that maybe half the people on Earth have at one time considered writing."
0,Spirited but uneven.
0,A modest film (in every sense) which pushes the gags too hard.
1,"Foster's second directorial effort is a vividly drawn if too episodic portrait of an eccentric family, well acted by the entire cast, especially Holly Hunter and Robery Downey Jr."

1,"Shadows is an unfinished picture in every sense of the word. Yet it is fitfully dynamic, endowed with a raw but vibrant strength, conveying an illusion of being a record of real people, and it is incontestably sincere."
1,"A very modern, impressionistic snapshot of New York bohemia with scenes linked not by dramatic line but by place, time and mood."
1,"This is the only Cassavetes film made without a full script (it grew out of acting improvs), and rarely has so much warmth, delicacy, and raw feeling emerged so naturally and beautifully from performances in an American film."
1,"Again and again the line between acting and living is erased. Caught in the ecstasy of collective creation, a handful of earnest amateurs have almost accidentally produced a flawed but significant piece of folk art."
1,[Shadows is] so far ahead of all Hollywood and independent films that once you've seen [it] you can no longer look at the official cinema: you know that American cinema can be more sensitive and intelligent.

1,Vanessa Redgrave has never been more likable on screen than in her buoyantly athletic turn here.
1,"There's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about Persuasion, Roger Mitchell's adaptation of Jane Austen's final novel."
1,"Michell's approach to Persuasion indicates that he is the rarest of literary translators -- one who is genuinely interested in a work's themes, its characters and what the author has to say about the world in which they exist."
1,"Persuasion is Jane without pain, E-Z Austen. It's a delight."
1,"Much of the movie's emotional work has to be done by...faces and eyes, while other people speak of other things, and to see that happening is frustrating, because it happens so slowly, and romantic, because it happens at all."
1,Austen fans: Prepare to be swept away.
1,"The film offers the same pleasures as an Austen novel, as the audience sinks into a comforting, orderly world where life-shattering disruptions are handled with elegant ease."
1,"Persuasion is proof that the most repressed love stories can have the sweetest payoff. Like Anne herself, the movie reveals its wonders slowly."
1,"To Die For endows Nicole Kidman with her career role to date, and one that only an actress with her porcelain features could even attempt."

1,"Nicole Kidman's work here is inspired. Her clothes, her makeup, her hair, her speech, her manner, even the way she carries herself (as if aware of the eyes of millions) are all brought to a perfect pitch."
1,"To Die For has its share of truly delicious sequences, and some biting dialogue worth killing for."
1,"Although Van Sant makes wicked sport of television, he doesn't underestimate its power to blind us to its faults and bring us to our knees."
1,"To Die For could have been a great film. It's not, but it shows what Nicole Kidman can do."
1,An irresistible black comedy and a wicked delight.
1,"If you've hitherto failed to respond to the laid-back oddball appeal of Van Sant's movies, fear not: this is a sharp, consistently funny blend of black comedy and satire on the deleterious effects of television."
1,"As Jimmy, the teen sap who falls hard for Suzanne, Joaquin Phoenix is dead-eyed yet touchingly vulnerable -- a mush-mouthed angel."
1,"If, like me, you find things to admire in all of Gus Van Sant's early films, you may be especially gratified by what he's done with a satirical anti-TV script by Buck Henry."
1,A smart and wicked delight
1,It's highly recommended.
1,"A smart black comedy that skewers America's fatal fascination with television and celebrity, it employs an unerring nasty touch to parody our omnipresent culture of fame. And it uses a rather unlikely combination of talents to do the job."

0,A rote variation on Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper that is marginally salvaged by those spunky Olsen twins from ABC's Full House.
0,"It's so featherbrained and lightweight, it almost elevates its inconsequence into a style."
1,Writer Deborah Dean Davis and director Andy Tennant are fully aware of the absolute predictability of their material and therefore make the getting to an inevitable ending as much fun as possible.
0,"Under the direction of Andy Tennant, the Olsen sisters lay on the icky-poo cuteness with several trowels, often delivering their lines as though they were reciting the alphabet."
0,"Alas, the Olsen girls are not immediately heart-warming."
1,"The film's underlying sentiment is conveyed effectively, if obviously."
1,"This 1947 film is limited in scope and feeling, but the superficial dramatics work well enough."

1,"In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Scorsese."
1,Martin Scorsese's fascinating new film Casino knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas.
1,"Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker, so skilled in the manipulation of imagery he might be the most proficient of active American directors."
1,[A] Vegas masterpiece.
1,"Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script."
0,"It's an ambitious film, but also a scattered, unfocused one."
1,"Of all the bravura visual effects in Martin Scorsese's dazzlingly stylish Casino, it's a glimpse of ordinary people that delivers the greatest jolt."
0,"The result, sadly, is that contradiction in terms, a dull Scorsese movie."
0,"Scorsese may be flailing here, but Scorsese flailing is more formidable than most directors at the top of their form."
0,"It's not the actors' fault that no one is able to break through the film's gorgeous but chilly surface. You watch Casino with respect and appreciation, reveling in its documentary sense of detail."
1,"Martin Scorsese's intimate epic about money, sex and brute force is a grandly conceived study of what happens to goodfellas from the mean streets when they outstrip their wildest dreams and achieve the pinnacle of wealth and power."
1,"[Stone] seems to be trying to enter a more passionate movie, where a neurotic gold digger could at least have a good time. By the end of Casino, for all its craftsmanly bravura, you may want to join her."
1,"So long as Casino stays focused on the excesses -- of language, of violence, of ambition -- in the life-styles of the rich and infamous, it remains a smart, knowing, if often repetitive, spectacle."
0,Simultaneously quite watchable and passionless.

1,"Combines a shrewd understanding of Shakespeare with a healthy, low-brow approach to cinema."
1,"While this curious clash between a near-modern setting and the much older source material might seem confounding, it actually serves to energize the play, as well as making it more palatable to present-day audiences."
1,"This is Shakespeare exciting enough for even the most dubious, which, after all, is no less than the man deserves."
1,It is all in the grand manner of Shakespearean tragedies.
1,This triumphant take on the Crookback king is as different from Olivier's '50s historical pageant as chalk is from malmsey.
1,"In a shamelessly entertaining display of acting brilliance, McKellen 'plays' the demon's good arm as if it were a Stradivarius, executing one showy stunt after another."
1,A sure-fire crowd-pleaser among recent Shakespeare movies.
1,"Whatever its flaws, the revelation of this Richard III is that updating Shakespeare may be even more ideally suited to the movies than to the stage."
0,"An outrageous, wickedly funny, 1930s fascist version of the Shakespeare play starring Ian McKellen as Richard of Gloucester.;"
1,"The ""fascist"" staging could have been hackneyed, but Loncraine carries it off superbly as the showcase for action-thriller noir."
1,Rarely has a film used London's landmarks so cannily.
1,Heat is an ''epic'' that feels like a stunt.
1,Boosters and touts use the term 'major movie' so often that it's more likely to generate yawns than excitement at this point. Back to basics. Heat is a major movie. With major stars. Doing major acting.
1,"For a film that deserves Oscars for photography, editing, sound and arguably scoring, Heat is packed with unforgettable subcharacters."
1,Heat generates lots of energy but gives off little light.
1,"As with his other works, [Mann] binds sound, music and pictures into one hypnotic triaxial cable and plugs it right into your brain. He makes this almost-three-hour experience practically glide by."
0,"All the squealing tires, flying bullets and falling bodies cannot save Heat from drowning in its own banalities."
1,"If there's one thing Michael Mann knows how to do, it's create tension."
1,"This is the first time De Niro and Pacino have acted together, and each gives a strong, watertight performance."
0,... a colossal disappointment.
1,Michael Mann's writing and direction elevate this material. It's not just an action picture.
1,"All this adds good weight and tension to the movie and provides a lot of very good actors with the opportunity to do honest, probing work in a context where, typically, less will do."
1,The cop/ crime stuff that makes up the bulk of the movie is well thought out and well directed.
1,"Michael Mann and a superlative cast have taken a classic heist movie rife with familiar genre elements and turned it into a sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving."
1,"Taken altogether, Mann doesn't do anything particularly new, but with a subtly used supporting cast he combines everything into an unusually articulate action thriller."
0,"As Heat progresses, its sensational looks pale beside storytelling weaknesses that expose the more soulless aspects of this cat-and-mouse crime tale."
1,"This is simply the best American crime movie -- and indeed, one of the finest movies, period -- in over a decade."
1,Robert De Niro's last great role before he devoted himself to self-parody.
1,Heat occupies an exalted position among the countless contemporary crime films.
1,"When Pacino's loud, bruised cop and De Niro's canny crook stare at each other, you can read something spent and weary in their eyes and voices. The heat is hell. So are their jobs -- but somebody's got to do them."
1,"The taciturn De Niro and the braying Pacino share a flawless scene over a cup of coffee, but the real honors go to Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd as a warring, loving couple."
0,"So why doesn't Heat, with its elaborately staged, tautly edited robberies, its killer cast, edgy score and elegant cinematography, offer more satisfaction? It's the script, stupid."
1,"Just when it seemed that the only hope for crime movies lay in the postmodernist artifice of films like Pulp Fiction, Mann reinvests the genre with brooding, modernist conviction. This one sticks to your gut."
1,"There's nothing really new in this lengthy 1995 thriller by writer-director Michael Mann about cops and robbers in Los Angeles, but it has craft, pacing, and an overall sense of proportion, three pretty rare classic virtues nowadays."
1,"An odd though often entertaining blend of The Asphalt Jungle and Oprah, a traditional cops-and-robbers story weirdly fitted out with long, earnest discussions of interpersonal relationships."
1,"There isn't much going on at this party other than what the actors bring to it. But fortunately, Mann has invited some exceptional ones."
1,Heat becomes consistently more interesting as it forges on toward the 180-minute mark.
0,"Unfortunately, it's so dark -- and impenetrable -- that it shuts us out."
1,"Macabre and provocative, yet wonderfully restrained."
1,"Abel Ferrara, working from a rabidly ambitious script by Nicholas St. John, gives the genre a provocative and perversely funny snap that Anne Rice might envy."
1,"Love him or hate him, Mr. Ferrara is one of the few directors who can turn genre movies into something deeper."
1,"Scary, funny, magnificently risible, this could be the most pretentious B-movie ever -- and I mean that as a compliment."
1,"No matter, without exactly transcending the awful material, Ferrara puts it across with astonishing poetry and conviction."

1,"Polished, classy"
1,"Despite the unambitious, formula-driven plot, wonderful performances by Julia Ormond and, especially, Harrison Ford keep this remake afloat."
1,Sydney Pollack miraculously almost pulls off his updated homage simply by choosing well and popping enough champagne corks to make us believe the wealthy are still glamorous despite Donald Trump.
0,Never evokes the sweet allure of Billy Wilder's original film.
1,Has a level of complexity rare in contemporary Hollywood.
1,"A light fairy-tale, sweet and charming."
1,"Just as satisfying, if not as dry and cynical, as the original."
1,A warm and clever romantic comedy that stands on its own and offers a good time for two hours -- despite its myriad implausibilities.
0,"The remake, alas, must mask its failings with Julia Ormond's toothsomeness, Pollack's poky pacing and the uninspired scribblings of writers Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel."
0,Proves too flimsy of a reed to be successfully replanted.
0,Ford looks as stiff and old hat as his homburg.
1,"Blossoming into radiant color, this film has picture-postcard charms that the black-and-white earlier version could only hint at."
0,"Ormond's face is certainly not hard to gaze at, but she looks so often ill at ease that her 'confident' gay smiles suggest, inappropriately, some masked pyschological distress."
0,"We remain outside the fourth wall looking in but are never drawn in; bemused perhaps, even agreeably complaisant, but never entirely amused."

1,"Regardless of its dated stylishness (which still holds up remarkably well a decade + later), Heavy Metal was a pioneering film in 1981 and remains a pivitol and infuential body of art today."
0,"Asked if I wanted to see it again, I figured, why not? I would have remembered if it was really bad. But memory does play tricks."
1,"Heavy Metal has been animated with great verve, and scored very well, with music much less ear-splitting than the title would suggest."
0,"Fantasies that are gratuitously sexist and Fascist (macho whoring and warmongering), and whose roots reach all the way back to post-hippie paranoia, feed the tangled plot-lines of a movie that... should disappoint even the teenage wet-dreamers."
1,"Some of the animation is first-rate, particularly in the more modest comedy segments, and even the heavy set pieces have greater flash and dazzle than anything Ralph Bakshi mustered around the same period."
1,"Initial segments have a boisterous blend of dynamic graphics, intriguing plot premises and sly wit that unfortunately slide gradually downhill."
0,"Van Damme races against time, trying to thwart Boothe and defuse all the bombs. But in the hands of director Peter Hyams, these are just banal action-movie chores."

1,"Though the climactic duel atop the arena roof is patently absurd, it's also exciting as events go into sudden-death overtime, just like the game being played below."
0,"About the best thing that can be said about this movie is that the action scenes, directed by Peter Hyams, are choreographed with flair. Unfortunately, the material connecting them is worthless."
1,"A treat for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans, a superior action thriller loaded with jaw-dropping stunts and special effects, and strong in production values."
0,"Despite the elaborate stunts, go-go-go direction from Peter Hyams, + butt-kicking and surprise goalie action from Van Damme, Death deserves the hockey-puck booby prize for...getting its jollies by putting kids in jeopardy."
1,Sudden Death is one of the best action thrillers of 1995. It's also the film Jean-Claude Van Damme has been building up to for 10 years.
1,"Offers above-average pyrotechnics, a body count that steadily mounts, and plenty of hand-to-hand combat."
1,"Reuniting Hyams and Van Damme, director and star of Timecop, this spectacular nail-biter exploits their combined, if limited, abilities to the full."

1,An extremely affecting experience
1,"Sarandon, who won the Oscar for Best Actress for this role, is superb, but Penn is extraordinary."
1,A thought-provoking drama not to be missed or dismissed.
1,"Robbins and Susan Sarandon, have crafted a film that transcends its own political message by a scrupulous attention to detail."
1,"is the finest, least compromised film about capital punishment ever advancing a gently stated 'anti' view but going the extra 100 miles to give victims their due."
0,"Robbins, who also wrote the script, is no Truman Capote, let alone a Victor Hugo, and his film trips up constantly on indecisiveness about what it is he's trying to say."
0,The picture is cloudy in intent.
1,Its final moments leave us awash in emotion.
1,"A daring stand and a daring, uncompromised film."
1,Penn gives an astonishing performance and delivers exactly what Dead Man Walking needs.
1,"Absorbing, surprising, technically superb and worth talking about for a long time afterward"
1,Acting rarely gets better than this.
1,"Dead Man Walking could easily be manipulative or exploitative, but it's neither. Instead, this is hard-hitting drama that neither accepts nor offers quarter."
1,"Takes us along on the reluctant, difficult, essentially spiritual journey these two unlikely people make together."
1,"An intelligent, balanced, devastating movie."
1,"Tim Robbins's balanced yet uncompromising approach refuses to judge any of the characters, including the killer (superlatively played by Sean Penn), instead giving each a fair chance to present their case with dignity and respect."
1,"It's a strong film, made stronger by two terrific performances. Penn's acting has ruthless honesty."

1,A nearly perfect movie about a nearly total screw-up.
1,"Wuthering Heights is a competent, tasteful, frequently even lovely re-adaption of Emily Bronte's Gothic, mystical love story. But the brooding tension, the electric passion of two lovers compelled to an inevitable tragedy is not generated."
0,"Because Miss Bront챘's Wuthering Heights defies easy or consistent interpretation... the director, and Patrick Tilley, who did the adaptation, have felt free to make bluntly clear relationships that in the novel remain forever ambiguous."
0,"I admire its courage and the always welcome presence of Harry Andrews (as Earnshaw), Judy Cornwell (as Nellie), Pamela Browne, Rosalie Crutchley. But I can't forgive its dullness."

0,What virtues the movie has are cosmetic.
1,"While this sly and sumptuous new film offers just the single word as its title, it will make you think of all you learned about Restoration comedy -- and drama -- in that long-ago History of the Theater 101 course."
1,"A garishly gilded, gloriously overstuffed costume drama."
1,"Solid entertainment, especially in a season when Hollywood's releases are repeatedly causing grimaces."
1,Restoration avoids the pitfalls of pious historical reconstructions and plunges right into the cauldron.
1,"Lively, lavish and grandly acted pageant."
0,"The movie takes on a somber, fitful atmosphere of straining epic proportions. But it strays into an episodic bog that leaves it gasping for dramatic life."
0,The film is overcome by the rumbling workings of a creaky plot as the story grows more serious.
1,"Since the robust 17th-century picaresque tale is not enjoying any current vogue, the success of ""Restoration"" can be considered a very pleasant surprise."
0,Engaging if uneven.

0,"Black Sheep is bleatingly awful as it reteams Chris Farley and David Spade, the poor idiot's Abbott and Costello, in a comedy so desperately inept it makes their previous effort, Tommy Boy, look like a minefield of high wit."
1,"They're certainly no Aykroyd and Belushi, or even Myers and Carvey, but Farley and Spade manage to wring humor from a series of juvenile setups and predictable pratfalls."
1,"Works as well as it does because the anarchic, high-energy spirits of Farley and Spheeris lock into each other perfectly."
1,A little comedy that succeeds in its modest aim to provide 87 minutes of harmless diversion.

0,In its last minutes Screamers becomes the last thing it intends to be -- laughable.
1,"Screamers oozes atmosphere. It's a dark film that borrows heavily from the likes of the Alien films, Dune, Blade Runner, and John Carpenter's updated The Thing."
0,It's not exactly a bad movie; it's made with a certain imagination and intelligence. But its future is so grungy and grim it makes our current mess look like Utopia.
0,There's nothing exhilarating or enjoyable in any of this.
0,"Until it succumbs to one cliche too many, Screamers, which was directed by Christian Duguay, does an efficient job of generating a stomach-knotting tension."
0,"The design and effects teams have lent scale and impact to the futuristic locations and sets. If only Duguay's flashy, aimless direction had succeeded in filling these barren wastes and antiseptic interiors with something resembling human life."
1,"A fun, fast-paced futuristic thriller with enough jolts per frame to keep even the most impatient action fan happy."
0,"Based on a short story by the great nutball sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, Screamers is more like a high-pitched rip-off of Alien."
0,The ensuing Darwinian struggle combines space opera skirmishes and Cold War paranoia - although the characters' dialogue involves the kind of tough guy/gal posturing overfamiliar from the sort of '80s action movie this was in fact supposed to be.

0,"The real question is, could director Oliver Parker have done worse?"
1,"For sheer impact, this Othello can stand side-by-side with the versions brought to the screen by Orson Welles (as restored in 1992) and Lawrence Olivier."
0,"Passion, like outpourings of iambic pentameter, isn't part of this picture's equation."

1,Those who appreciate the irony of a killing machine turned loose on a pack of nasty students will find The Substitute a source of nonstop delight.
0,"Aside from a lot of only moderately-satisfying violence, The Substitute comes across as rather lame."
0,"The title changes, the actors change, and the superficial details of the story change, but it is always about exactly the same thing: heavily armed men shooting at one another."
0,"There's a certain amount of camp value to this over-the-top thriller, which might as well be called Rambo Goes to High School."
0,The entire setup is too garish to be credible.
1,There's a sense of shrewd observation throughout The Substitute that makes it come alive and seem quite a few cuts above such usual genre fare.

0,"This sour, repetitive fare fails to feed our hunger for either laughter or enlightenment. It's all empty calories and reactionary chic."
0,"As the body count gets higher, and the housemates begin to question their high-and-mighty purposes, the movie stumbles under its sophomoric moral weight."

1,There is some thought behind this broad humor.
0,"Cynthia Roberts's film is poignant and courageous, but its curious status -- a film of a play that seems to want to be a documentary -- muffles its impact."
1,"This impressive debut feature by Stacy Title has its wobbly technical moments and one or two underdeveloped narrative strands, but it's brimful of provocative ideas and moral dilemmas as well as being extremely funny."
1,
1,"The movie, based on the famous comic novel by Stella Gibbons, is dour, eccentric and very funny, and depends on the British gift for treating madness as good common sense."
0,"""Cold Comfort Farm"" may be hysterically funny to regular readers of Hardy, Lawrence, Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters, but it won't ring many bells for the rest of us."
1,"Thanks to Schlesinger's exacting direction and Malcolm Bradbury's witty, restrained script, these characters are kept more amusing than horribly pitiable."
1,"Mr. Schlesinger draws lively performances out of his cast and surprising variety out of the film's secondary sights, which range from a gala soiree to a heap of steaming dung."
1,Dickens meets the Beverly Hillbillies.
1,
1,"What could be more welcome than a classic English comedy, bristling with wit and hilarity and crammed with wonderful eccentrics?"
1,"Schelsinger's masterfully directed eccentric satire is based on Stella Gibbons' 1933 book which spoofs the serious, soul-searching, rural-set stories of writers like D.H. Lawrence and Mary Webb."
0,"Malcolm Bradbury's script and John Schlesinger's direction ... between them coarsen, soften and simply lose much of Gibbons' extraordinarily sophisticated, wonderfully funny humour ..."

1,"The film has a genial it's-only-a-movie attitude that sets it apart, quite emphatically, from other blockbuster action movies."
0,There's precious little reward in plumbing the world-historical implications of the screenplay.
0,"As for the human characters, they give merely adequate back-seat support to the special effects that drive this big-budget thriller."
0,"Unfortunately, and perhaps not unexpectedly, it doesn't live up to the hype."
0,"The aliens, when we finally see them, are a serious disappointment; couldn't they think of anything more interesting than octopus men?"
1,"Though the movie isn't too deep, it's certainly a rousing state-of-the-art cartoon capped by an aerial-combat climax that, to its credit, isn't anti-climactic."
1,"You know going in that Independence Day will have terrific effects and loads of action. But the filmmakers have also carefully crafted appealing characters and several good relationships, which they develop as the story unfolds."

1,"So much about ID4 is so old it's inevitable that homesick audiences, eager for familiar scenarios, will embrace it as if it's nothing but new."
1,"The build up is terrific, with enormous spaceships emerging from the clouds to hover silently over the world's major cities."
0,
1,"The picture is ultimately fun, thanks mostly to the colorful characters and the mock-hero ic spirit that kicks in full-throttle after the world has almost been destroyed."
1,"Everything feels anti-climactic after the fireworks, but the moral is clear: it's the end of the world as we know it. And we feel fine."
1,Splendidly cheesy entertainment.
1,"It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what we Americans like in a monster hit."
1,"If I were a 10-year-old boy, I'd probably think it was the coolest movie going."
1,As unavoidably entertaining as it is hopelessly cornball.
0,Maybe the moviemakers' mission was to boldly go where everyone in Hollywood has gone before: the bank.
1,"The earnestness, the effects, and the notion of a whole world forgetting its differences to defeat a common foe carry a certain charm."
1,"It may be film-making by numbers, but the numbers are the right ones, and they fall into place with a satisfying clunk. This is everything a blockbuster should be."
1,"Sonnenfeld has directed with gusto and precision from a vaguely plotted but often hilarious screenplay, and his view of Manhattan as a holding pen for intergalactic refugees has the touch of authentic experience fundamental to all great comedy."
1,"""ID4"" presses all the current hot buttons with great efficiency which will make it hard to keep in mind that just because a movie kicks major butt doesn't mean it's good."
1,"A sci-fi story constellation of the brightest star elements. With German director Emmerich at the helm, Independence Day soars as filmic uber-craft."
1,"Even in a movie that's all noise and bluster, Cage and Connery inject tasty bits of personality into their roles."
0,"When film more or less took over melodrama from the theater ninety years ago, it proudly provided real oceans instead of canvas waves rippled by stagehands; but the plots remained humbug ... The Rock is as ridiculous an example as one could want."
0,[A] 2 1/4-hour exercise in overkill.
1,"Excitement may be The Rock's selling point, but it has plenty more to offer than you bargained for."
1,"A first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor."
1,"Cage steals the show, adding a touch of wimpiness to the high-decibel bravado."
1,Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have a highly-successful resume that includes Top Gun and Crimson Tide. The Rock will add more luster to that reputation.
0,"Ultimately, the movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself."
1,"Pure why-not bravado, pumped-up and staggeringly dishonest but exciting just the same."
0,"Slick and forceful, largely unconcerned with character, eager for any opportunity to pump up the volume both literally and metaphorically, The Rock is the kind of efficient entertainment that is hard to take pleasure in."
1,A popcorn-movie deluxe.
0,"From a helicopter's point-of-view, The Rock is just typical big American dumb fun. It's only when you look underneath at the film's underlying assumptions that you want to recoil."
0,"Even for adults, the movie's a violence-intoxicated, far-fetched, morally corrupt drama that sinks like a... you know."
1,"Fake countdown and knowing reactionary tone, but the best SF car chase to date."
1,"Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie Mission: Impossible should have been."
1,"The yarn has its share of gaping holes and jaw-dropping improbabilities, but director Michael Bay sweeps them all aside with his never-take-a-breath pacing."
0,"There isn't a shot, scene or sequence in The Rock that doesn't move furiously, typically with colored lights flashing into our faces or onto those of the actors."
0,"You might need to take Dramamine before entering a Michael Bay movie. The one-time music-video director has an annoying habit of finding the tightest shots, editing the heck out of them and scoring the works to loud music."
1,"For action-adventure fans, it just doesn't get any better than The Rock."
1,"Since the plot is ridiculous, The Rock works best when it's most light-hearted."
0,"If it's not the most awful thing I've ever seen, it's close enough to make me wince."
1,"The borrowings from other movies, going all the way back to the car chase in 1968's Bullitt, are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written."

1,The Phantom is one of the best-looking movies in any genre Ihave ever seen.
0,If Treat Williams were the Phantom and Billy Zane the capitalist villain would any significant nuances be lost?
0,"A lightweight action adventure, derivative in its look and approach. It's strictly for kids, but it's possible to appreciate the picture for what it is."
1,It's nice to see some things done the old way.
0,"Expect this ghost of bad movies past to walk quickly to the back bins of Blockbuster, where it should be filed under a helpful heading, monotonous and juvenile."
0,
0,"This belated, albeit decorative adaptation looks tamely second-hand."
1,"While it hardly stands to vanquish the celluloid incarnations of Superman and Batman, this version of an older cartoon crusader's exploits does have a pleasingly astute sense of its place in the great scheme of things pulp."
0,"As the Phantom, Billy Zane, buff to the max, has a likable insouciance, but there's not much he can do to flesh out this relic."
1,

1,"Brando's performance is enormous fun, but it's not just a joke. He's hilarious and gently mesmerizing at once, and director John Frankenheimer savvily adjusts the tone of his movie to fit Brando's daft brilliance."
0,"Neither Miss Loos, Mr. Emerson nor Mr. Griffith can be said to have accomplished anything particularly novel by this screen work."
0,"D. W. Griffith's last film, a crude, grim, grotesquely sentimental melodrama about an alcoholic's degradation, fits into the rare category of films that are great but not really very good."
1,"One of his most powerful and intensely felt works -- not merely a heartbreaking story and a portrait of the Depression at its grimmest, but a poignant summary of everything that Griffith could do with a camera."

1,"McConaughey, 26, is dynamite in a performance of smarts, sexiness, scrappy humor and unmistakable star sizzle."
0,
1,"Untrained as an actor, with only three minor roles to his credit, McConaughey holds the screen against Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey, and completely justifies the buzz surrounding his role..."
1,"If the film doesn't add up to a cogent legal argument, neither does it have trouble delivering 2 hours and 20 minutes' worth of sturdy, highly charged drama."
0,"Justice may be blind, but rarely have courtroom dramas presumed quite so heavily on cultural myopia as this heinous version of John Grisham's first novel."
1,"Although it has its share of implausibilities, A Time To Kill is generally the most satisfying of the John Grisham screen adaptations to date."
1,A likable -- maybe even lovable -- movie.
0,

0,"The narrative is very complex, but what's on the screen is little more than generic, non-narrative-specific, guy-being-chased stuff."
1,"[Chain Reaction] has better acting, better writing, more spectacular chase sequences and more genuine drama than all of this summer's blockbusters."
0,"It's not a bad film in individual moments and in the energy of itsperformances, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
0,Chain Reaction isn't dull -- the film is paced to keep audiences attentive -- but the lack of originality dampens its enjoyability.

1,"Alive with the luscious turn-ons of sex and danger, Freeway is the most impressive debut film I've seen all year."
1,Both grimly funny and thought-provoking.
1,"Like it or hate it (or both), you have to admire its skill, and the over-the-top virtuosity of Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland."
0,"It's too drawn-out, too talky and, at the most crucial moment, needlessly implausible, to sustain its humor and large dose of violence."
1,Rude in the way the truth is rude -- only funnier.
1,"Cynical, stylish and witty."
0,Freeway glints here and there with dark humor amounting to a knowing wink that undercuts the cautionary tale at its heart and the seriousness of its graphic sociology.
1,"There's not much edification in store, and [director] Bright cruises over some bumpy plot holes, but the teen's perspective does put a black comic spotlight on wider social hypocrisies."
0,"""Freeway"" is a thoroughly nasty piece of work, the product of a filmmaker with a ludicrously misplaced confidence in his own cleverness."

1,The performances and the film's plausible handling of an unusual movie subject make Girls Town special.
1,"Does an excellent job of uncovering the angst, pressure, and doubt associated with the late teenage years."
1,"Constructed without a traditional denouement, Girls Town will nevertheless satisfy viewers who want something that feels more like life than like art."
1,Features good work from its performers.
1,"I would like to see another movie in three or four years, about what has happened to these angry, gifted friends."
1,A welcome little gust of teen-age realism.
0,"Taylor, Harris and Grace come up with some watchable, genuine moments. But they're often too involved in themselves; the movie indulges them too much."

0,"Harriet the Spy has real character in some of its details, but it never feels like much more than a low-budget TV show."
0,...a tedious adaptation...
0,...the pacing is slow and there are scenes that seem amateurish...
0,"The film's OK, a little thick with sensory overload, but it wasn't made for old guys like me."
1,"Fresh and charming, it never plays down to kids."
0,"There's a certain amateurish quality about Harriet the Spy, but it's more the TV-trained grownups behind the camera...than the pint-sized thespians in front of it."
1,"Harriet the Spy is an intelligent, insightful look at the tribulations of being a creative, misunderstood misfit at age eleven."
0,"There's dancing, and bubble blowing and bed bouncing that's entirely aimless and Harriet's neighborhood sleuthing becomes particularly pointless."
0,"...in busily updating the '60s story for the more worldly '90s, the filmmakers have ended up, ironically, with a product much more naively juvenile than the original."
1,"As the film progresses, the story becomes engaging."

0,"House Arrest is an uneasy mix of too much and too little: too much vapid cuteness, too little real feeling."
0,"The characters are so broadly overdrawn and the performances so over the top, it's a tossup as to which hell you'd least like to visit. Upstairs? Downstairs?"
0,"There's little to commend this formulaic and misleading fantasy, which seems sadly aimed at an especially fragile audience -- kids from broken homes who all too often blame themselves."

0,"One of the year's worst movies... at least I hope so, or it's going to be a very bad year."
0,[A] predictable and sugarcoated (even criminally negligent) take on The Parent Trap.
0,"To the slim degree that it qualifies as a comedy, House Arrest is a comedy with rank amateur pathos, and it's totally out of touch with its own superficially treated emotions."
1,"It's an emotionally rounded fairy tale that balances darkness and sentimentality, pathos and triumph, with uncanny grace."
1,"By sticking faithfully to the broader themes of Hugo's story -- those of desolation and desire, of trust and betrayals thereof -- the creators have fashioned the most poignant and deeply moral story to roll off the Disney storyboards in decades."
0,"The latest and most uncertain of Disney's animated efforts, with its manic mood swings and cloying, none-too-cuddly hero."
0,The Hunchback's message -- that beauty is only skin deep -- goes only so far.
1,This is pretty sophisticated for so-called kid stuff.
1,This is the least-enjoyable animated feature to come from the studio since its 1989 rebirth.
1,A high point in the renaissance of Disney animation.
0,"Like another famous tale set in Paris, Disney's animated version of Victor Hugo's venerable The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the best of times and, if not really the worst of times, something uncomfortably close to it."
0,Adding to the film's split personality is Demi Moore.
1,Gorgeous but dark -- not the usual Disney experience.
1,"Though Alan Menken's music misses the big tune that would cap Stephen Schwartz's nimble lyrics, it's the thematic sophistication that brings the movie to life, making older children and adults its best audience."
1,"There is much to admire in Hunchback, not least the risk of doing such a downer of a story at all."
1,"The result is a grand cartoon cathedral, teeming with gargoyles and treachery, hopeless love and tortured lust."
0,Surely one of Disney's ugliest and least imaginative efforts.

1,Paltrow is smashing.
1,
1,"[Paltrow] plays the title role in Emma with wit, timing and a to-the-manor-born graciousness...It's an intelligent performance from an actress everyone was ready to dismiss as a lightweight."
1,"Gwyneth Paltrow sparkles in the title role, as young Miss Woodhouse, who wants to play God in her own little patch of England."
1,It's not difficult to enjoy the genteel amusements Emma provides even while wishing its virtues were less wholly on the surface.
1,"Gwyneth Paltrow makes a resplendent Emma, gliding through the film with an elegance and patrician wit that bring the young Katharine Hepburn to mind."
1,
0,"When the going gets tougher the film doesn't have many answers, and the odd unsettling surge of over-emphasis betrays an eye on the American market."
1,"Suddenly you remember how merciless and cutting Austen's satire can be, even in the brutal '90s."
1,Perhaps the highest praise that can be given Paltrow is that there are no appreciable performance gaps between her green talents and the rest of the truly top-drawer cast.

0,Missing is a sense of the interior life behind the smiling face that Selena showed the world. What of the drive that led her to music? What comfort did she find in it? What pain?
0,"Nava, who started his feature-film career with El Norte, is a good director who invariably finds a strong rapport with his actors. He's not much of a writer, though, and he should think twice about creating dialogue for his future projects."
0,"By the end of the film, Selena has been all but canonized."
1,"Selena surmounts its connect-the-dots approach to its heroine's life to create an appealing, energetic look at a too-briefly soaring musical star."
1,"... Lopez's presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom, and with ""Selena"" she's seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers."
1,"At its best, ""Selena"" suggests why so many people reacted with such great heartbreak to her death."
0,"When it doesn't, however - when Selena teeters precariously in the direction of hagiography and buckles under the weight of representing all Latinas to all people - then the real young woman herself is hard to find."
1,"What makes this movie work is Jennifer Lopez's electric performance as Selena, capturing the charismatic aspects of Selena's stage persona and the essence of her maturity as a growing woman."
0,It tries to satisfy too many different groups at once and ends up watering down the art so much it satisfies no one.
1,"Gregory Nava's 1997 biopic about the Mexican-American pop star Selena Quintanilla Perez... is typical of the genre's excesses, but I enjoyed quite a bit of it, in large part because of the energy and charisma of Jennifer Lopez in the title role."
1,"Sayles has surrounded his hero with other, more interesting characters and has warmed Lone Star with the glow of a humanist optimism rare in contemporary movies."

1,"Sayles' witty, vividly demotic dialogue knocks even Tarantino for six, the characterisations are uniformly colourful and credible, the soundtrack and the widescreen camerawork exemplary ..."
1,A richly textured and thoroughly engrossing drama that ranks with indie filmmaker John Sayles' finest work.
1,[A] complex and rewarding new Texas murder mystery.

1,"""Ransom"" is dark and risky in a way that's become almost unthinkable for mainstream movies in the '90s."
1,"This is a blueprint for mainstream moviegoing, but be forewarned that the finale is surprisingly down-and-dirty. In this case, though, the violence blisteringly redeems what has been a merely OK thriller."
1,"Gibson gives an interesting performance, showing a man trying to think his way out of a crisis, and Sinise makes a good foil: Here are two smart men playing a game with deadly stakes."
1,A competent nail-biter that ably exploits a parent's worst nightmare.
1,"Strong acting, smart dialogue, and a couple of neat twists counterbalance many of Ransom's weaknesses."
0,"A persuasive thriller for most of its length, it stumbles in its attempt to become an upscale version of Death Wish and other vigilante dramas and ends up derailing with a soft thud."
1,Here's a tension-packed thriller that will shake your head and rattle your brain.
0,"A noxious, nerve-splitting invitation to vigilante rage."
1,"Mr. Howard has made ''Ransom'' in the same clean, swift, logical style that sent his ''Apollo 13'' into orbit, resulting in a spellbinding crime tale that delivers surprises right down to the wire."
1,"Howard pushes and probes this rich tension with expert casting, restless camerawork and a fractured editing style."
1,"A crackerjack thriller with some unusually tasty plot twists, Ransom pays plenty of entertaining dividends."
1,"Gibson has always had a mesmerizing dark side (remember his vengefulness in Mad Max?), and when his rage catches fire, so does Ransom."
1,The special nature of this story is its many climaxes that border on false endings and also how Gibson's character responds to the ransom demand of $2 million.... it is Gibson who sells us on it and sells it well.
0,"There are more climaxes in here than in a Swedish blue movie. This is not to say you won't be thrilled, charged up and put through the ringer at times, but your intelligence will need to be shoved under your seat like warm, flat soda."
0,"That's interesting stuff, but it doesn't play out with a lot of smarts. And the opportunity to end Ransom on a creepy note of unpredictability is forsaken for the usual glass-shattering, bullets-flying finale."
0,"With a mechanical movie like this, filmmakers -- male or female -- can't take chances. Howard and company are hostages to their own conception."
1,Mel Gibson and Rene Russo put an edgy 1990s spin on the roles originally played by Glenn Ford and Donna Reed.
1,"By the time Tom Mullen has turned into an action superhero in a clumsy climax, Ransom has run out of ideas, and we've lost track of what we felt about a father's frantic efforts to save his son."
1,"Its major sin -- a certain ineluctable improbability -- is pretty much offset by the moments of winsome humanity Gibson finds for his freebooter; by the rich, nicely tuned portrayals of the other actors; and by director Ron Howard."
1,"A gripping, amoral kidnap thriller."
0,"If Howard's direction were as stylized and self-aware as Corgan's music, Ransom might be something more than a shallow and unprovocative story of a vigilante with an Achilles' heel."
0,"Slick and violent and reasonably tense, Ransom holds your attention without being the least bit interesting."
1,"Poised on the knife edge between parody and homage, Wes Craven's Scream is a deft, funny, shrewdly unsettling tribute to such slasher-exploitation thrillers as Terror Train, New Year's Evil, and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street."
0,"While Scream has its frights, it feels more like one of those solve-the -mystery jigsaw puzzles than a real movie."
1,"Whatever you do, don't close your mind to such an inventive concoction. One last time, despite all your better instincts, go ahead -- open that theater door."

1,"Craven has expressed a desire to get out of the horror business. Maybe that's why he's set out to make more than a horror movie. He's contributing to a long tradition of reflexive films, going back as far as the turn of the century."
0,Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix.
1,The film plays lively games with the macabre.
1,Scream is a rarity: a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as well at provoking scares as laughs.
1,"I liked it. I liked the in-jokes and the self-aware characters. At the same time, I was aware of the incredible level of gore in this film."
1,"A bravura, provocative sendup of horror pictures that's also scary and gruesome yet too swift-moving to lapse into morbidity."
0,"It appeared to be clever, dangerous, witty, and fresh, but it sadly became victim to the movies it mocked, even before it had ended."
1,The best fright fest of the '90s.
1,Turns slasher flicks into slapstick.
0,"If the people who made Scream were half as clever as they seem to think they are, this would be a much smarter movie."
1,"At last, a horror movie to shout about!"
0,"The pic's chills are top-notch, but its underlying mockish tone won't please die-hard fans."
0,"The assumption that there's something inherently clever about a slasher movie making reference to both its genre and the filmmaking process is a fundamental flaw of this tiresome, blood-filled comedy."
0,"By the time Scream arrives at its final twist, Craven has done too many contortions of his own to give the finale much shock value."
0,"The picture is so full of cross-references, self-mockery and movies within movies (including a stalking that's recorded on video) that it can't help turning into a precious two-hour in-joke."
1,Scream builds to a splattering finale that should leave genre fans highly satisfied. Here's one of the year's better thrillers.
0,"Scream may be a cut above the gore fests that line the dimly lit back wall at your video store, but it is a far cry from genre classics like Halloween or Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street."
1,"No one will ever consider Wes Craven's Scream Oscar fodder, but this funny and scary little experiment in terror from the man who invented ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" puts some fun back into a very tired genre."

1,"The formula remains evergreen -- two attractive leads are thrown together by quirk; develop antipathies, even loathing; then, ultimately decide they have overreacted and are hopelessly in love."

1,"Michael doesn't set up big drama or punch up big moments. It ambles. Travolta, using the same offhand ease that worked in Phenomenon, works his magic on the humans without even seeming to have his mind much on his job."
0,
0,
0,"Travolta's charismatic presence is the only positive element in Nora Ephron's flawed romantic fable marred by rough narrative spots and scattered direction, again showing that Ephron lacks the most basic technical skills."

0,"In Love and War is not much interested in Ernest Hemingway's subsequent life and career, and even in its treatment of this early period, it doesn't deal with themes such as his macho posturing, his need to prove himself, his grandiosity."

0,Metro is about as generic as action pictures come.
1,"The big action scenes are cleverly staged and Eddie Murphy is back on his game again, with a high-energy performance and crisp dialogue."
0,"Despite Murphy's consistently strong performance, Metro meanders into a rather unremarkable cat-and-mouse territory."

0,"None of these performers is bad, but what they're doing is shallow and ultimately uninteresting."
1,"This version illuminates the story's numerous strengths, resulting in a motion picture of surprising emotional and intellectual impact."
0,"The first scene in ""The Crucible'' strikes the first wrong note."
1,
1,"With a head on its shoulders and the rawest emotions in its craw, Arthur Miller's stage hit The Crucible has become a cinematic grabber for grown-ups -- without that castor oil taste."
1,"Though Hytner remains essentially a stage director, he makes fine use of Massachusetts locations and period interiors; some of the visual details recall Dreyer's Day of Wrath, a film that likely had an influence on Miller's play"
0,"Despite these involving moments, The Crucible finally seems too schematic, more useful as an allegory than as drama, and possibly owing that undoubted popularity to its simplistic qualities as much as its insights into group psychology."
1,This stirring film lets you feel the heat of Miller's argument and the urgent power of his kick.
0,
1,"There's an awful, piercing truth in the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen and Paul Scofield as members of a community destroyed by guilt, paranoia and betrayal."
1,"Day-Lewis, Ryder and Scofield will be odds-on favorites for Oscar nominations, as will the movie itself."
1,Nothing in the movie is quite up to Scofield's Danforth. But what a mighty performance that is!
1,"Hytner holds the action together with solid, unflashy, well-paced direction, ensuring that this is no mere period piece but a compelling, pertinent account of human fear, frailty and cold ambition."
0,"Neither the establishing dramatic linchpin nor the final conversion of conscience is terribly convincing, leaving this pared-down rendition of the original work diminished in power and meaning as well."
1,"Then there's always Mr. Scofield, bringing an almost unbearable, yet entirely believable, lightness of spirit to his loathsome character. It's a bold stroke by a great actor, making zealotry and evil seem positively beneficent."
1,"I recommend Hytner's movie highly, but a part of me resists a work that makes the audience feel as noble in our moral certainty as the characters it invites us to deplore. Some part of its power seems borrowed from the thing it hates."
1,"Her cheeks flush, her winsome beauty seared with erotic rage, Ryder exposes the real roots of the piece. Forget McCarthyism; The Crucible is a colonial Fatal Attraction."
0,"Too bad, though, that The Crucible fails to probe deeper into the sexual, religious, and political conditions that can give false accusations so much power -- even today."
0,"Arthur Miller's screenplay keeps everything nice and faithful to the period, and the actors have the dirt on their hands to prove it. The movie lacks polish as well, and that's to everyone's benefit."
1,"I very much admire how Hytner... keeps the pace swift and doesn't fetishize the 17th-century decors and clothes. But I can't help feeling that in more ways than one, The Crucible is a period piece."
1,What happened in long-ago Salem does still seem to matter.
0,"Handsome and well-acted, the film's ultimate success depends on the heat between Ryder and Day-Lewis, and it simply isn't there. The attraction is fatal alright, but it certainly doesn't seem mutual."
1,"Perhaps understanding the distance that these fictional interpretations have created, The Crucible seems to invite a moral and emotional, rather then political reading."
0,"The script trips all over itself to be hip and flip before it takes a desperate dip into utter conventionality: dull car chases, explosions, inept slapstick."

0,The film equivalent of a lushly illustrated coffee-table book.
1,"I have seen dozens of versions of this play (either on screen or on stage), and none has ever held me in such a grip of awe."
1,"Kenneth Branagh directs and stars in a vibrant, full-text, full-hearted film from Shakespeare's most complex tragedy."
1,"Glorious as it is, this unexpurgated workout is ultimately a movie of moments."
1,"As star and ringmaster, Branagh gets to the heart of Hamlet and goes to admirable lengths to take his audience there, too."
1,"Branagh's version moved me, entertained me and made me feel for the first time at home in that doomed royal court."
1,"A vigorous, four-hour adaptation that's 100 percent Shakespeare and 100 percent cinema."
1,"By looking to the box office and the classroom with equal respect, [Branagh] has kept himself a friend of Shakespeare."
0,Every little triumph seems to inspire in Branagh some accompanying act of bad taste or judgment.
1,"This Hamlet may not be perfect, but it is perfectly engrossing."
1,"With his handsome and compelling Hamlet, Kenneth Branagh brings the Bard's greatest tragedy passionately alive on the screen."

1,Surprisingly entertaining but grossly dishonest.
0,"A flat piece of work with long, slack stretches."
1,"This is Sterno, not heat, but still plenty rude, crude and lewd."
1,[A] sure-fire hit comedy.
1,A comic firecracker with a surprising human touch.
1,People who wouldn't be able to distinguish Howard Stern from G. Gordon Liddy will be entertained by something like an off-colour -- and quite funny -- version of Coal Miner's Daughter.

1,"Not only will you laugh at someone else's pathetic problems, it'll save you money on therapy."
1,A must-see.
1,
1,"''Mother'' winds up showing a surprising degree of insight without compromising its deft, badgering comic tone."
1,"Brooks has created his best work so far. His oddball comedy has sometimes missed the target, but with Mother he has chosen an ancient theme and given it a smart, modern spin."
1,"In its deceptively modest way, this edgily sweet comedy gets closer to the bone of mother-son relationships than many a more solemn opus."
0,"Brooks' minimalism can be amazingly jampacked, but Mother is perilously slack."
1,What's really surprising here is that Brooks has finally discovered the very human heart beating beneath his trademark malcontent.
1,"Reynolds's exquisitely calibrated, mercurially comedic performance reveals the stifled passions that inform a lifetime of rigidly refined habits."
1,"The final duel, fought on burning poles and involving at least a half dozen Olympic skills, is dazzling."
1,"Not only visually brilliant, it's funny too."
1,"Not only has nothing essential been compromised, but the film seems crisper, cleaner and better organized than I remember."
1,It doesn't have much in the way of plot. But this high-flying tale about a Robin Hood/Zorro figure boasts spectacular action sequences that make story irrelevant.
1,"Its production values may not be as good as when Ang Lee or the Wachowski brothers are behind the camera, but the creative vigor of its originality, distilled in a pure and unadulterated form, is simply exhilarating."
1,"It's got more wit and heart, more eye-dazzling adventure, and more poetic depth than most big Hollywood movies."
1,Now here's a violent movie that the whole family can enjoy.
1,Monkey ends up being 86 minutes of action with none of the character depth that made Crouching Tiger an international sensation. You see it for its punch-outs the way you see Riverdance for its stomping.
0,"The action here is peerless. But seen after Crouching Tiger -- in which Yuen's martial-arts mastery was equaled, and balanced, by the story -- you might find yourself wishing for a little Hidden Monkey."
1,Action fans who like their kung fu in period costume and with little blood will likely think they've struck the motherlode.
1,"Think of Iron Monkey as the potboiling cousin of Crouching Tiger, rather than its most honoured forefather, and you'll be on the right wavelength."
1,"A rollicking, comic-book Robin Hood plot and more furiously entertaining fight scenes than the ones in Ang Lee's solemn martial-arts art movie."
1,A breathtaking pleasure certain to build anticipation for Yuen's future directing efforts on this side of the globe.
1,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was like fusion food, Chinese for Western tastes. Now, get ready for the real thing."
1,"The battles are as hilarious as they are stunning, full of kung fu and Shaolin trash talk, blindingly fast punches (achieved by under-cranking the camera, thus speeding up the motion) and breathtakingly inventive fight choreography."
1,"As with other, similar movies, you do have to buy into brazen pulp operatics to get through it. Still, there's a rough-hewn energy to the movie's pre-digital flying-fist sequences that all but neutralizes the unapologetic hokum."
1,"The story is fairly generic, but plot has as little to do with the pleasures of kung fu movies as story lines do in musicals."
1,Highly entertaining escapist fare.
1,"If Asian martial arts movies interest you even a little bit, you're going to want to see Iron Monkey."
1,"Pure ballet, pure candy for the eyes."
1,A cinematic marvel to behold.
1,What raises it above the level of conventional children's pulp entertainment is Yuen's dazzlingly choreographed acrobatic high-wire work.
1,Contains some of the most inspired martial arts sequences ever put on film.
1,"A film like Iron Monkey is basically aimed at audiences who want elaborate fight sequences and fidget at the dialogue in between. It's for the fans, not the crossover audience."
1,It hasn't aged a bit.
1,"[Yuen's] fights are innovative and intense, whether they're a whirlwind one-on-one duel or one of many struggles featuring multiple combatants."
1,"Yuen tosses off nimble, elegantly witty solutions to life's most vexing problems regarding rooms full of bad guys who won't take thwak for an answer."

0,"Like the substantially better Twister, this film insists on a thunderous, exhausting pace that inevitably becomes deflating."
1,This is one of the best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition). Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.
0,"Volcano is an absolutely standard, assembly-line undertaking; no wonder one of the extras is reading a paperback titled ""Screenwriting Made Easy."""
1,"The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual."
0,
0,"Jones and Heche work hard to dig up an emotional rapport from next to nothing, while the slow but inexorable progress of the lava makes for more suspense than the usual slam bang firework display."
0,"Never generates a head of true excitement, partly because the characters remain constructs designed to perform defined functions, and partly due to the time-worn hokiness of the whole disaster-film format."

1,"Caine's performance as Jack Carter has gone on to become the epitome of cool, with his measured and ruthless portrayal of a man consumed with revenge."
1,"A tense, hard-boiled crime movie that uses Michael Caine, for once, as the sure possessor of all his unconscious authority."
1,"Refusing ever to dwell, it cuts sharp rather than deep, but sharp enough."
1,"Mike Hodges' top-notch adaptation of a Ted Lewis novel not only maintains interest but conveys with rare artistry, restraint and clarity the many brutal, sordid and gamy plot turns."
0,It wallows in its ceaseless bloodbath and emerges like its protagonist -- sleazy and second-rate.
1,"Like Paper Moon, this mostly easygoing comedy-drama has its charms, despite promoting a dubious morality that finds amusement in ripped-off victims."
0,"The film is just there on screen, better than watching a clock, better than contemplating mortality, an OK experience. There are movies like this. No sense in pretending otherwise."
1,"The script is smart and sneaky -- by never telling the audience more than is necessary, it develops a keen sense of suspense that persists until the gritty final reel."
1,"While independent films flourish, they have nearly eradicated the scrappy B movie, of which this is an agile, enjoyable example."
1,"This is a film about people who get by depending on antisocial skills and outlaw wit, and Green and writer Jim McGlynn clearly empathize with their independent spirit and lifestyle, even if they don't completely approve."
1,"Paxton has an Everyman quality that makes it possible to overlook his skill, but here he finds the right way to be true to his criminal career while still scamming: His heart is in the right place, even if his hand is in your pocket."
0,"Though competently directed by Clint Eastwood's camerman Jack Green, matters unravel when the film ratchets up the tension and become entirely implausible at the close."
1,Eastwood's longtime lenser Jack Green makes a decent feature debut with a well-acted comedy-adventure that in its good moments recalls such classics as The Sting and The Grifters.
1,This fresh and interesting story about a tight-knit clan of Irish grifters in the rural South who make their living scamming is a ''con men on the road'' picture all the more welcome during a season of junky action thrillers...
0,"George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series."
1,"If you like 'em busy, this sequel is for you."
1,Some nifty celestial surfing and a good finale compensate for a dead midsection.
0,"Apart from its eye-appeal, though, Batman & Robin is a virtually joyless exercise, a lumbering saga of a city under assault on two fronts."
0,"This indiscriminate racket, more than anything, sent me out into Times Square with the feeling of having been roughed up. The area hasn't changed so much after all."
0,"The film's look is all that money can buy, and, as always with blockbuster wannabes like this, it's a shame that money can't buy even more."
0,"Like a wounded yeti, Batman & Robin drags itself through icicle-heavy sets, dry-ice fog and choking jungle vines, before dying in a frozen heap."
0,"Wonderful to look at, and has nothing authentic at its core."
0,"Holy creative breakdown, Batman!"
0,"Pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue."
1,"As played by Uma Thurman, Poison Ivy is perfect, flaunting great looks, a mocking attitude and madly flamboyant disguises."
0,"[Schumacher's] storytelling is limp, and the characters lack energy."
0,"Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward."
0,The fourth Bat-flick finds this juvenile franchise running on empty.
0,"Loud, uninspired, and interminable."
0,"The villains, Arnold Schwarzenegger and especially Uma Thurman in this instance, remain the highlights here, as the rest of the gargantuan production lacks the dash and excitement that would have given the franchise a boost in its eighth year."
0,"By now, the dispatching of various comic-book meanies is the least satisfying part of the deal, no matter how many disco scenes or gizmos are thrown onto the screen."
0,"Of all modern Batmans, George Clooney bears the closest physical resemblance to the comic-book hero, but there isn't much to say about his performance because there isn't much performance to discuss."
0,"The movie has its entertaining flashes, but there's too much bat-jive and bat-hokum."
0,"In terms of new twists or narrative momentum. Poison Ivy, the sinuous villainess, is the only relief from the onslaught of spoofy humor, special effects and meaningless comic book mayhem."
0,"[A] loud, long and pointless spectacle."
0,"Batman & Robin won't kill the popular series, but it ought to slow it down a tad."
0,There's plenty to look at but nothing to feel.
0,"The fourth installment of the lucrative Batman series is the weakest yet, but anyone not expecting that after 1995's Batman Forever will probably be too dazed by all the bright lights in the theater lobby to notice anyway."
0,"Fourth time's not the charm in this rambling sequel, which gets off to a roaring start, then quite literally crashes."
0,"A sniggering, exhausting, overproduced extravaganza that has virtually all of the humanity pounded out of it in the name of an endless parade of stunt sequences."
0,"Noisy, campy, overproduced, it's abdicated all solemnity in pursuit of a boom-kaboom videogame esthetic."

1,Breakdown gets the job done.
1,Pretty good.
1,Mostow knows his Hitchcock as well as his Spielberg.

1,"A pleasant surprise, one of the most witty, entertaining family films to come out in some time."
1,The story is incidental -- the villain wants to abduct the talking ape for financial gain -- and thankfully the animatronics and computer effects aren't allowed to overwhelm the proceedings.

1,"The Game is an intensely exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller, the kind of movie that lets you know from the start that it's slyly aware of its own absurdity (which is why it can then get away with it)."
1,"As it's unspooling on screen, the film is hugely entertaining, but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely they're investigated."
1,"Douglas is the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change."
0,"It's like the most hideously overproduced episode of The Twilight Zone on record, complete with a last twist that pretty much reduces what came before to soap bubbles."
0,Fincher is still working on the assumption that he has better things to do than entertain an audience. Which would be fine if he weren't drawn to such schlocky material.
1,"Douglas, who delivers a new shade of cruel elegance each time he plays another urbane monster, is the ideal star for this vigorously contrived thriller."
0,
1,A crowd-pleasing pip most of the way.
1,"Douglas disintegrates beautifully against the pressure of a constant and unknown threat, played out by a deliciously sinister support cast."
1,"The picture provides Douglas with one of his best roles. If he doesn't quite reach the bizarre heights he achieved in Falling Down, The Game makes its own demands."
0,
0,The film's 'message' about complacency transformed by chaos and uncertainty is hackneyed...
1,Regardless of how far one chooses to buy into The Game -- and the ending ambiguously suggests that it could go on and on -- there is no doubt as to Fincher's staggering expertise as a director and his almost clinical sense of precision.
0,"This 1997 thriller is fairly entertaining nonsense if all you're looking for is 128 minutes of diversion. But if you'd like something more from David Fincher, the director of Seven, don't get your hopes up."
1,"The rational side of my brain can pick this movie apart until all that's left is incoherent threads. The movie-mad side, happy to lose control, had a hell of a good time."

1,"Satisfactory mainstream entertainment, with a handful of major actors in juicy minor roles tossed in for good measure."
1,Voight proves again what a great character actor he's become by stealing the film as a country club-type defense lawyer with a julep tongue.
1,"Coppola has infused The Rainmaker with enough humor, character, honest emotion and storytelling style to make it one of the year's most entertaining movies."
1,"Coppola adapted the novel himself, and he's done a good job of paring it down."
1,"This competent, anonymous legal drama (scripted by Michael Herr) is the best John Grisham adaptation yet."
1,"Coppola has never been particularly known for his comic touch, but here he seems bent on leavening the melodrama with as many laughs as possible, and they are generally honest and well-earned."

1,"More character study than polemic, [Imitation of Life is] wonderfully warm and witty."
1,"Because of the authority with which it is acted and the skill with which Director John Stahl has built up individual episodes, the picture remains an efficient tearjerker, outspoken in its praise of motherlove."
1,"Director John Stahl was a notable visual stylist (although this film contains few of his characteristic flourishes) and was possessed of the prime asset of the melodramatist, the ability to take his material seriously and make it play."
0,"Despite the sincerity of John M. Stahl's direction, he scarcely manages to conceal the shallowness of the play's ideas, the commonplace nature of its emotions, nor the rubber-stamp quality of its writing."
1,Imitation of Life is a strong picture with an unusual plot.
1,"There is little of popular action in the story, but there is a great deal more of quality than should appeal to the discerning film patrons."

1,"What the film lacks is suspense, surprise (the new ending is a dud) and passion."

1,"Steven Soderbergh's best film since Sex, Lies and Videotape a decade ago."
0,"Some reviewers have applauded Out of Sight for its nuances of character, but I and others don't see any characters at all."
1,"As always with the best of Leonard, it's the journey, not the destination, that counts, and director Soderbergh has let it unfold with dry wit and great skill."
1,"With Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh returns to cracking form with a sharp, funny, classy movie that leaves a wry grin on your face long after the credits roll."
1,"Out of Sight isn't just a rousing piece of entertainment, it's also a cinematic salvage operation."
1,Out of Sight may go down in the annals of film as the movie in which George Clooney learned to keep his head still -- and became a leading man.
1,"A splendid reminder of just how assured, intelligent and involving Soderbergh's movies can be."
1,"From the first shot to the last, Mr. Clooney is in complete command of the screen in the assured manner of the biggest stars in the past, and he doesn't need a ton of special effects and digital enhancement to generate excitement."
1,Steven Soderbergh's most ambitious and most accomplished work to date.
1,Out Of Sight is another fine mess Elmore Leonard has got us into.
1,"Out of Sight may be the first movie that has truly gotten an Elmore Leonard novel on screen, in all its hangdog wit and fractured-jigsaw form."
1,"Soderbergh understands the flaky, funny spirit of Leonard's characters and he gets his cast to express it."
1,Out of Sight is slick in all the right ways.
1,"Clooney is the most impressive he's been on film. Jack Foley feels real, not like some Hollywood improvisation. Foley is charming, handsome, graceful, cultured, energetic and disciplined. He just can't stop committing crimes."
1,"The characters all seem to have known each other for years, referring to long-held grudges and resentments that only gradually are revealed to the audience. They're a seedy, petty, dangerous and delightful bunch."
1,"After many mishaps, the art of bringing Elmore Leonard's novels to the screen is coming to fruition. This latest adaptation, by director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank, gets it just about right."
1,[A] now-classic romantic comedy -- with plenty of action and suspense.
1,"There isn't a character in the large, excellent cast that doesn't emerge with depth and precision."
1,A darkly amusing and sly romantic comedy about an accident-prone bank robber (George Clooney) who falls in love with the sexy federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) on his tail.
1,Easily the best film I've seen in 1998.

0,"What's missing is chemistry: the right blend of seriousness and whimsy, and charmingly compelling interplay between leads Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, who turn in lackluster perfs."

0,"The new Avengers is dismal in dispiriting, dreary ways, and Ralph Fiennes, playing Macnee's part, is a particular disaster."
0,Some bad movies are bold outrages; many others become hits. This one hasn't the juice to be either.
0,"This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name."

1,The Negotiator deserves a place among the best action/thrillers of the year. This is a Dog Day Afternoon for the '90s.
0,"To the extent the setup allows Spacey and Jackson to go head to head, it's a good thing. But there are other elements in the film that aren't nearly as interesting or satisfying."

1,"Big as it is, Blade is meticulous and subtle, not just in its camera technique but in the way it works its themes and creates a mood."
1,Pure visceral imagery.
0,"Although the opening scene suggests a dark urban satire, Blade quickly turns into a cartoonish futuristic action-adventure yarn in which Blade is the only thing keeping humanity from being exterminated by vampires in a hematological holocaust."
1,The fight scenes -- particularly Blade's first appearance -- are undeniably exciting.
0,The sort of glittering trash pile that makes you dread the words comic-book movie.
0,"Blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied."
1,Snipes plays his superhero character with such aching coolness that you can't wait for the next dumb-ass vampire to get in his way.
0,"There are lots of stunts, chase sequences and so much computer morphing that the effects house must have been offering it at discount."
0,Blade would've been a lot more fun if everybody had lightened up a notch.
0,"An attempt to redefine cutting edge horror, this techno-vampire pic is spoiled by the same weak storytelling and flashy, computer game visuals."
0,Hopelessly dated before its release.
0,"Though slick and diverting in some aspects, increasingly silly pic has trouble meshing disparate elements -- horror, superhero fantasy, straight-up action -- into a workable whole."
1,"For a while, anyway, this vampire picture flies."
0,"Has the comic-book movie reached the end of the line? The glumly familiar, been-there-done-that aspect of Blade certainly suggests so."
0,"Blade is often ridiculous, mostly poorly written and, surprisingly poorly acted too."
1,What is unusual about the film is the way it combines high-tech violence with the more up-close-and-personal violence of vampires. These characters and the aggressive way they attack each other justify all the film's considerable noise.
0,"Such techno-action may give Blade enough power for a sequel, but one is left wondering whether there's any room for its central character to sustain interest beyond this flashy debut."
1,"Creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence make watching this comic-book movie entertaining. In fact, it's arguably the best comic-book movie of the year."
0,Noise and martial-arts action mask its tinny pedigree.
1,"Blade's stomach-turning special effects, bone-crunching martial arts and cynical humor will more than satisfy any action-film addict's need for a fix of eye-popping escapist adrenaline."

0,Norton's acting and Dahl's gift for sustaining a tone save Rounders from completely floundering.
1,"Rounders is not breakthrough material, but it makes for an entertaining evening out."
0,"According to director John Dahl's Rounders, professional poker players are very, very interesting people -- for about five minutes."
0,No energy!
1,Rounders cheerfully buys into compulsive gambling!
0,"Rounders' script is pretty shabby going. Well, not shabby, really, just simplistic."
1,A sure bet!
0,"Though Damon is an actor who's flatly impossible not to root for, the longer this film lasts the less patience we have to stay with him."
1,"In fighting to show the psychological complexities in Mike that the script ignores, Damon plays it like a rounder instead of a grinder. This kid still has surprises up his sleeve."
0,"Though it's a good-looking flick with some smart acting and a few flashy runs, it barely breaks even dramatically, and feels, overall, like a good chance wasted."
0,"The end result is still short of a winning hand, since the screenplay is so utterly predictable."
0,"The wholesome pup's poker face alone, however, hardly accounts for the film's failure to thrill. Damon's character doesn't really have that much stake in the story's outcome."
0,Intermittently engaging but dramatically slack.

1,"Like Sheriff and Tony, we're pulled both ways by the story: We want them to go back and save Lewis, but we're not exactly sure we'd do the same. That's the Prisoner's Dilemma in a nutshell."
1,"The real discovery ... is Vince Vaughn, who didn't make as much of a splash in Jurassic Park: The Lost World as he was expected to. Now he does."
1,"Though the clock ticks relentlessly enough to sustain the story's tension, the film finally seems to be a character study in search of a gripping plot."

0,"If it's to be experienced at all, Return to Paradise is best seen as a lively piece of pulp, not a profound exploration of the vagaries of the human soul."

1,
0,"It's a painful prospect, to be sure, and Sheriff, in particular, insists he's no hero, but the next hour or so of handwringing conjures little suspense."
1,
1,This beautifully acted and paced German variant of Cape Fear ... is tricked out with a number of Brechtian devices to catch audiences in a voyeuristic trance.
0,The basic puzzle is why this sophisticated director chose this tired formula.
1,The emotions of the victims are clear and complex -- their conflicts dominate our experience of the narrative as powerfully as all the devices telling us to look elsewhere for the movie's themes.
1,"Brilliant, radical, provocative, it's a masterpiece that is at times barely watchable."
0,The film outstays its welcome and is more than a little too knowing in its manipulation of standard audience expectations for the genre.
0,The action is strictly routine.
0,"It's a big, clanging, brutal, actioner in which we search the murk in vain for the sparks of humanity the moviemakers keep promising us."
0,Soldier is little more than dumb genre stuff!
0,"With a cheerful disregard for characterization and visual texture, Anderson relies on his cgi-jocks and set dressers to flesh out David Webb Peoples's by-the-numbers script."
0,"Soldier is so mediocre, it might have been more mindless fun if it had been even worse."
0,A waste of snappy set decoration!
0,"Has there ever been a more insipid sci-fi action film than Soldier? Probably, although it's hard to imagine."

1,A potent comic-book-style action-adventure.
0,I doubt that Kurt Russell has ever had less dialogue to work with than he has in this film.
0,"The action is handled fairly well, but it's routine, and there's no satisfaction in seeing Todd waste men who are no more bloodthirsty than he is."
1,This appealing formulaic action adventure (1998) displays a lot of conviction in its not-too-flashy action scenes and a little levity in the gradual socialization of Russell's character.

1,"A complex, highly talented work marked by intellectual and philosophical ambitions!"

0,"Dispenses with plot, characterization, dramatic structure and emotional payoffs in favor of the sort of painstakingly composed pictorial diddling that invariably gets critics frothing about the director's ""indelible"" images."
1,"At two hours and 45 minutes, The Thin Red Line gives ample evidence of suffering all manner of cuts, if not having been simply hacked into its final shape. But this violence only adds to the movie's brave, strange, eroded nobility."

0,"Benigni certainly knew the risk he was taking with his idea, but the circumstances overwhelm him."
0,Roberto Benigni's comic fable about one family's struggle to survive in a Nazi concentration camp is in offensively poor taste.
0,The lesson that Benigni ultimately imparts is that it's easy to convince a child horror doesn't exist as long as it stays out of the way while the two of you are goofing off.
1,"In the real death camps there would be no role for Guido. But Life Is Beautiful is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit."
1,You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll smile through the evils of genocide!
1,Life is Beautiful has come under attack in some circles for mocking the Holocaust. Nothing could be further from the truth.
0,"The picture doesn't work, at least not to the extent it was intended to."
1,"Art-house sentimentalists will likely go for Beautiful in a big way, but even those who aggressively resist manipulation can find a lot to admire."
1,"dares to laugh in the face of the unthinkable. And because Benigni can be heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works."
1,"It's a high-wire act without a net, and Benigni pulls it off with astounding grace and sensitivity."
1,he film's absurdist account of fascism gives the first half rich comic flavors that grow darker as the story progresses.
1,"Its sentiment is inescapable, but genuine poignancy and pathos are also present, and an overarching sincerity is visible too."
1,"Yes, there are heaps of charm and poignancy in this trifle, but it's a trifle nonetheless -- light-and-bright, for sure, but also slight-and-trite."
0,How appealing you find it will probably depend on your response to Benigni's screen-hogging routines -- the line between endearing and irksome is a fine one.

1,"The Siege is many things at once: tense, exciting, disturbing, and thought provoking."
1,"Even at its most unbelievable, The Siege has the performances of Washington and Bening to fall back on, and a theme that understands that what's difficult is not choosing right from wrong but 'choosing the wrong that's more right.'"

1,Gleeson plays Cahill as an ordinary man who does this stuff because he's good at it.
1,"Boorman's film is shot in wide-screen black and white, and as it often does, black and white emphasizes the characters and the story, instead of setting them awash in atmosphere."

1,"Sadism is the film's only real subject, and its only real life as well."
0,So generic that it sometimes approaches the self-parody of a Naked Gun movie!
0,This film is riddled with cliches and impossible situations.
1,There is much cleverness and ingenuity in Payback.
1,"It is well written, contains a flock of colorful characters, and gives star Mel Gibson a number of great one-liners."
0,"It's undone not so much by the shadow of Lee Marvin falling heavily on it (which it does) as by the twin obstacles of big star image and, more to the point, excessive violence."
0,"In the popcorn sense, it certainly delivers on mindless escapism. In the artistic sense, let's just say that Payback is a long way from Point Blank."
0,"It quickly slides into a Lethal Weapon without Danny Glover, complete with blowups and wisecracks, gratuitous torture scenes and Gibson in familiar form as the twinkling rascal who makes a virtue out of viciousness."
1,A higher class of thriller.

0,"None of the cast comes off well, but they have little to work with, since the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot and performed without rehearsal."
1,"Arrogance gives way to humility, making this an appropriate, if thoroughly cliched, Christmas morality tale that's sugar-coated with an attractive cast spouting sitcom-quality dialogue."
0,This family comedy finds unearned laughs in old women and dog flatulence.
1,"Feverish, whimsical allegory elevated by moments of brilliant clarity."
1,The film can be both frenetic and strained. But it also has has a great deal of power and can be quite haunting.
1,"A sprawling, rowdy, vital film laced with both outrageous absurdist dark humor and unspeakable pain, suffering and injustice."
0,"There's no denying Kusturica's technical virtuosity as he mounts one hectic, large-scale set-piece after another, but in the end it's hard to fathom the exact purpose of this epic allegory."
1,"Emir Kusturica's epic black comedy about Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1992 is a three-hour steamroller circus that leaves the viewer dazed and exhausted, but mightily impressed."
1,"Delirious in its excess, but never less than ferociously intelligent and operatically emotional, Underground represents one of those rare, exhilarating moments when an outsize artistic vision is fueled by an apparently unlimited budget. Not to be missed."

1,"A rich, vibrant, visually spectacular survey of the changes the place has gone through during the past 50 years."
1,Kusturica takes us from wacky farce to harrowing grief to lyrical fantasy to bloody horror. To ignore any side of Underground is to do it injustice.
0,"Underground is a bizarre, often repellent anti-war parable that takes forever to state the obvious but hits some scattered high notes on the way."

1,"A gross, flagrant, in-broad-daylight violation of the Law of Billing."
1,"A big, dumb action movie done the right way, with decent characters, something resembling a point and monsters you can root for."
0,Renny Harlin's pretty good when things happen fast and not much good when characters talk slow - or at all.
0,Mindless fun requires a lighter touch and more suspense than director Renny Harlin can deliver.
1,"Despite scene after scene of mayhem, Harlin manages to create and and sustain extremely well-coiled tension."
0,"You might guess that this movie will feature yelling, at least once, 'Let's get the hell outta here!'"
1,Call it silly. Call it obvious -- there's nothing more obvious than a shark attack. But this is one of the few big-fish horror films that still has the power to surprise.
1,Mr. Harlin is a true poet of demolition.
1,"If we're laughing at the movie: there's something very gratifying about the regularity with which Harlin cuts his cheesy characters down to size. And as a piece of cinematic engineering, it's nothing if not efficient."
1,This highly unlikely story about genetically enhanced sharks that terrorize the scientists who created them is one summer movie that delivers exactly what it promises: nonstop popcorn thrills.
1,"If you like big summer action flicks with plenty of bite, check this one out. Then go out for a big sushi dinner. It'll make you feel better."
0,"Scary, absurd, inessential."
1,"The characters are sufficiently naive to get picked off one by one, but their ignorance doesn't extend to the genre conventions governing their behavior, making for some shockingly funny moments."

0,"There are few truly frightening moments in the film, little tension or real sense of menace, and the camp humor that is suggested in early scenes dissipates fairly quickly."
1,"In The Haunting, the moviemakers succeed in something very difficult: creating a haunted house with real personality and terror."
0,"This film relies on special effects instead of suggestion, plot instead of mood, and explanation instead of mystery."
0,The Haunting is a muddled mess that defies any rationality.
0,Shockingly lethargic!

1,"Hoffman charts a middle course, and travels it quite well -- his version is neither as elaborately baroque as Max Reinhardt's 1935 film treatment nor as starkly sexual as Peter Brooks's celebrated 1970 staging."
0,"Unfortunately, despite the wonderful locations, sets, costumes, and strong acting, this adaptation has a strange lack of magic or chemistry between players."

1,An Ideal Husband works because Wilde created an expert mechanism (kind of slow-motion serious screwball comedy) for manipulating the plot and characters.
1,"Parker, who himself adapted Wilde's play for the movie, takes what to purists may be an unforgivable number of liberties with the story, fleshing out the plot and even adding dialogue."
0,[T]his Husband plods and ambles and bears the burden of a soundtrack that resembles a wimpy meditation tape.
1,"Much of the four acts of An Ideal Husband, a serious comedy, is constructed out of flip one-liners, most of which remain, though Parker has added a few, all unworthy of the master."
1,"Our familiarity with the actors, and their comfort in this period setting, lend the piece an unexpected air of naturalism."
1,"In adapting the play, Mr. Parker has streamlined and rewritten Wilde's dialogue, keeping some (but not all) of Wilde's biting epigrams and scraping off a lot (perhaps too much) of the Victorian crust."
1,"[The] film is hardly memorable, but it's amusing enough for two hours, and it never panders or cloys."
1,"Wilde was always about lots more than witty repartee, and as sparkling as his play is as drawing-room comedy, it reveals his concern with the timeless values of unselfish love and forgiveness."
1,
1,"[I]t's likely that Mr. Wilde, who once wrote, 'A poet can survive anything but a misprint,' would have been less than thrilled with the result."
1,"Parker has made a sensible cinematic translation of Wilde's play, intercutting scenes which would have been played consecutively on the stage."
1,"Smooth-flowing direction, a shrewdly pruned script and a top-flight ensemble cast that visibly relishes both the dialogue and one another's perfs make this a tony item for upscale, mature audiences."
1,"An enjoyable, minor, lustrously shot revamping of Oscar Wilde's play about the perpetually interlocked manners of love and deception."
1,"The bright, crisp design, Wilde's arch eloquence and a classy company help to camouflage the shortcomings."

1,Viewers who mistake the didacticism for stylistic weakness miss much of the point of this nicely toned movie.
0,"Ultimately when it's all said and done, Best Man remains always a groomsman, never a groom: It backs down on its promise to both challenge and entertain, opting instead for the easy laugh--and the pat ending."

0,A strange trip but a far from satisfying one.
0,The problem with this film is that the filmmakers want Kaufman to emerge as a kind of innocent while their biographical due diligence indicates that Kaufman was a head case.
1,"A brilliant, almost terrifying impersonation."
1,"A brilliant, maniacally funny, and dizzying experience."
1,"What is most wonderful about Man on the Moon, a very good film, is that it remains true to Kaufman's stubborn vision."
1,The crowning performance of Jim Carrey's career.
0,"A movie that's too conventional to capture Kaufman's insanity and too haphazard, too shapeless, to recapture Kaufman's energy in any meaningful way."

1,"Carrey gives an otherworldly, possessed performance."
1,A formidable piece of work.
1,"This is a movie that testifies in blisteringly persuasive terms to the intense, particular genius of Jim Carrey."
1,The best performance of Carrey's career.
1,"What the filmmakers have accomplished here is the simplest and best thing they possibly could have done. For two hours, they have brought Andy back to us just as we remember him -- brilliant, provocative and, yes, very funny."

0,Anna and the King starts off better than it ends up.
1,This may be the best and healthiest date movie of the season.
0,Disappointing.
0,A misstep for the gifted Ms. Foster.
0,"Foster, I believe, sees right through this material and out the other side, and doesn't believe in a bit of it. At times we aren't looking at a 19th century schoolmarm, but a modern woman biting her tongue."
1,Generally interesting and sometimes emotionally affecting.
0,"Like too many movies, this one cannot bear to end quietly and gracefully."
0,The problem with Anna and the King is that it's caught halfway between then and now.

0,One of the dumbest chase thrillers ever to stumble onto the big screen!
1,"A generally dumb movie with a smart, appealing, gutsy leading lady."
0,The result has a drawback common to such movies: too much screen time devoted to the conceit when anyone who has seen the coming-attractions trailer knows it already.
0,Visual lushness is almost the only indication that the movie was directed by the same Bruce Beresford who made Breaker Morant and Driving Miss Daisy.
0,Double Jeopardy is single-minded and engaging thriller storytelling without an afterglow.
0,The picture itself is so nonsensical you don't understand why anyone would actually make it.
0,A lukewarm outing that mostly just bops from plot point to plot point.
0,
0,This movie should be exhumed and executed again!
0,"It has no subtlety, no shadings, and no suspense, and might as well not have a screenplay."

1,A thoughtful and even inspiring film.
1,"Denzel Washington delivers a mesmerizing, volatile performance."
1,"Washington elevates the earnest, occasionally simplistic narrative to the level of a genuinely touching moral expose."
1,"Its celebration of a spirit that refused to go down for the count is the important thing here, and Washington gets it shiningly right."
1,A pleasurable experience.
0,"The story never radiates much beyond the corruption of Carter's lifelong enemy, Paterson detective Vincent Della Pesca."
1,It's a measure of Washington's strengths that he swims while the film sinks.
1,You can always tell where The Hurricane is leading you. But the trip is strong and stirring.
1,First-class film material.
1,This movie about the nightmare of incarceration makes you taste the meaning of freedom.
1,"The last great performance of 1999, and arguably the best of the lot as well."
1,Washington can bank on an Oscar nomination for the most forceful work of his career.
1,"This is strong stuff, and I was amazed, after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film, to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts, until at the end I was blinking at tears."
1,Beautifully crafted and uplifting.
1,"The Hurricane delivers a mighty emotional load, most of it borne on the broad shoulders of a great actor hitting his prime."
1,Stirring but schmaltzy.
1,An extraordinary story by any measure.
1,"Epic in nearly every way, The Hurricane has the power to blow you away."
1,"An expertly crafted, deeply moving film."
1,"As the Hurricane, Denzel Washington blows away everyone else in this film -- and just about everyone else in any film in recent memory."
1,Fashioned with the kind of classic Hollywood professionalism that's fast becoming a rarity at the movies.
1,Features Denzel Washington's toweringly triumphant performance as Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter.
1,"Like broccoli, The Hurricane is good for you."
1,Denzel Washington's performance in the title role is even more absorbing than the screenplay invites.
1,The Hurricane has real mythic power.
1,Jewison has delivered another excellent film.
1,Occasionally riveting.
1,Give director Norman Jewison credit for two things: 1) He made the movie; 2) He let Washington run away with it.
1,A reminder that there's still a lot to be said for the good old-fashioned inspirational Hollywood movie.
0,"The movie's dogged humorlessness, and its sixties-style cant, don't do justice to all the political crosscurrents in this story."
0,Facile and unpersuasive.

1,Kirk Douglas is still the champ.
0,It'll be hard not to check your watch every five minutes.
1,The star's courageous performance is the main attraction of a movie that shamelessly pours on the sentiment.
0,Diamonds can be proud of its achievement as the ultimate primer on elderly embarrassments and the best ways to exploit them.
1,"Douglas, always one of Hollywood's most vigorous actors, still commands the screen as Harry."
0,"Diamonds feels like it was conceived as a showcase for Douglas at 83, and so it is, but what a dreary story and unconvincing characters he has been surrounded with."
0,Inappropriate for audiences of all ages.

1,An effective love story that's intensely old-fashioned.
1,The elegance of Roger Pratt's camera and the handsome costuming create a tension between the stately surface world and the raw passion of the characters.
0,"For all its obvious psychoanalytic implications, [Jordan's] wacky romantic triangle lost me long before it crawled to its spiritualist conclusion."
1,Jordan proves again that he is a supreme storyteller of complex human dramas.
0,"The characters are so unsympathetic, the adulterous love affair at the heart of the story so joyless, and the three main performances so mannered that it's hard to feel anything but disappointment and boredom."
0,
0,This is the kind of movie in which even the sex scenes are soulless.
0,Guaranteed to be mistaken for a first-rate picture.
1,For two-thirds of The End of the Affair [Jordan] does an astonishing job of fusing his pop-magical temperament with Greene's astringency and wit.
1,
1,The best and most graceful Greene adaptation since The Third Man.
1,Tasteful and seductive.

0,This Mansfield Park becomes a kind of romanticized gloss -- an imaginative grad-student thesis that melds author and character.
1,Spins the most interesting modern re-interpretation of the Austen canon.
0,"Despite its brazen politics, Mansfield Park never goes giddily amok as promised."
0,"Rozema's movie ... in trying so hard to entertain, ends up sabotaging itself."
1,Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park continues Jane Austen's winning streak on film.
0,"Too often steps out of its era to adopt a knowing, politically correct, late-20th-century attitude to the society portrayed."
0,
1,A qualified success.
1,"It's alluring to see a costume drama that takes us inside the subtlest, most wrenching realities of money."
1,A fine addition to the filmed Austen canon.
1,"Mansfield Park is a witty, entertaining film, and I hope I haven't made it sound too serious."
1,"A gorgeous, enchanting experience."
0,"Though it's never dull, this Mansfield Park has too much of its own agenda and too little of Austen's to completely succeed."
1,"Mansfield Park is quick and funny, and a refreshing break from period-film stuffiness."
1,Ms. Rozema has made a film whose satiric bite is sharper than that of the usual high-toned romantic costume drama.
1,"Full of sparkling dialogue, witty asides, and top-drawer performances, Mansfield Park is a social satire wrapped inside a romantic comedy."
0,
1,"While this version plays somewhat fast and loose with the original story, and even more so with the heroine's character, it is still much more Jane Austen than not."
1,"Rozema's handling of the entangled amours and social gamesmanship at Mansfield Park is delightful...It's impure Austen, but potent moviemaking."

1,It's one of the more watchable spin-offs from the show.

0,A comedy with several good laughs but no convincing cohesion.
1,The funniest SNL movie since Wayne's World.
0,"Superstar may not be the most unnecessary movie of the year, but it's got to rank right up there."
1,Silly but compellingly sweet movie.
0,"Here is a portrait of a character so sad and hapless, so hard to like, so impossible to empathize with, that watching it feels like an act of unkindness."
1,Delivers plenty of laughs and succeeds on a level that recent SNL movies didn't.
0,A stick-figure Rembrandt that provides neither the quick surreal poke of a TV satire nor the full lustre of an actual movie.

0,"As in The Haunting, they eventually surrender characters and story to computer-generated spectacle, squandering any creepy immediacy and trampling the human element."

1,One of the most magical movie moments of the year.
1,"Keep it authentic, keep it modest, keep it hopping. That's what happens in Tumbleweeds."
0,"Beyond the leads' accomplishments, the movie isn't exceptional."
1,"Tumbleweeds is far from a slick Hollywood-style production. It's not encumbered, for one thing, by star power. There's no list of past hits, Oscar bids, parts gone wrong."
0,A deeply and disappointingly conventional picture masquerading as a free-spirited one.
1,"Movies like Tumbleweeds exist in the details, not the outcome. Even a happy ending, we suspect, would be temporary. We don't mind, since the characters have been intriguing to know and easy to care about."
1,There is something so poignant and generous and sad in that dilemma that women all over may watch McTeer's performance and glimpse an essential truth in it.
1,"Tumbleweeds is one of those wonderful, deeply personal pictures that pop up every now and then to lift your spirits."
1,
1,At the center of the film is one of the year's best performances -- that of British actress Janet McTeer.
1,"Tumbleweeds is a slender novella of a film, but it's closely observed and honestly presented."
1,Features two unforgettable performances from a pair of actresses who are bound to make their mark in the movies.

0,Feeble and formulaic.
0,"If you go in hoping for a funny-sweet wedding comedy that deserves to stand with Four Weddings and a Funeral or My Best Friend's Wedding, The Bachelor will leave you standing at the altar."
0,Probably the best that can be said about The Bachelor is that it gave a lot of work to female extras.
0,Desperately unfunny.
0,The Bachelor doesn't generate enough laughs or sighs to hold together.
0,Business as usual.
0,"The funny thing is, nobody who made The Bachelor seems to notice that the script pinpoints its own formulaic emptiness before wheezing on to its foregone happy ending."
0,The humor never strikes the right champagne-bubbly tone.
0,"You know a movie is desperately overreaching when Peter Ustinov, affecting a dreadful southern accent as Jimmy's grandfather, must yell into a megaphone for no apparent reason: 'The human condition!'"
0,As desperate as its thousand wannabe brides.
1,"As much as I hate to admit it, The Bachelor is funny."
0,"O'Donnell and Zellweger are easy on the eyes, but we're asked to take it on faith that they have other qualities that would make a person care for them."
0,Its satire is too broad to carry much of a sting.
0,
0,A pretty lame premise for a movie.
0,"Steve Cohen's screenplay, is pretty much DOA."
0,A perfect bore.
0,The new film takes a heavy approach to plain foolishness and doesn't exactly gain loft from the presence of O'Donnell in the centerpiece role. His range is limited to several shades of bland.
0,"O'Donnell lacks the timing to make the material play, and Sinyor's slack direction offers little assistance."
0,"You don't have to know and love Buster Keaton's inspired 1925 farce ""Seven Chances"" to dislike the modern remake ""The Bachelor,"" although it certainly doesn't hurt."
0,Viewers have almost two hours to become thoroughly disgusted
0,Just say I don't.
0,"""The Bachelor"" is as generic as they come, the kind of commercial fabrication that sets up a pair of hackneyed concepts, then runs them in concentric circles until there's enough footage to cut together a movie."
1,
1,"Bare-bones filmmaking, Last Night is nothing special to look at, but it has a witty, trenchant script, lots of complicated characters, and a few actors who turn human frailty into something nearly sublime."
1,"Although Last Night eschews sentimentality, the situation is so extreme that there is ultimately no avoiding it. But the intense performances of [Ms Oh and McKellar] ... keep the suds from billowing into more than a few discreet bubbles."
1,A wry treat.
1,"As the final hour approaches for the characters in Last Night, there are moments of startling poignancy."
0,
1,Last Night succeeds where so many other films have failed because it concentrates on the element that its predecessors have ignored: the human factor.
0,"McKellar is a good storyteller, and he demonstrates a clever -- albeit dark -- sense of humor. But much of it goes for naught because of the movie's sterile patina."
1,"For all its wry humor, it concludes as a heart-piercing affirmation of life and love in the face of death."

0,Ugly is in the Eye of the Beholder.
0,Not terribly enjoyable to watch.
0,The movie might be worth seeing if you could find a theater that offers frequent-flier miles.
0,The film's plot degenerates into a psychological mess.
0,"Eye of the Beholder is like one of those optical cartoons that were so popular a half-decade back; the more we concentrate, the less we see."
0,Pointless
0,Eye of the Beholder is yet another example of how bad movies can happen to good people.
0,It isn't insultingly bad; it's just incompetent.
0,"The more complex it tries to be, the less compelling it becomes."
0,Eye of the Beholder attempts to convey emotional dislocation and passion at the same time. All we get is distance.
0,"The tone is stillborn and static when it should be ominous and engrossing. The characters fail to connect with the audience. This is a cold, distant, and off-putting motion picture that generates little in the way of tension or suspense."
1,"Its neo-noir, psych-thriller signifiers don't just provide goofy flash via flashback but service a grief-concerned narrative in which time and space collapse into a surrealist black hole."
0,"Eye of the Beholder more or less throws Vertigo, The Conversation, Body Double, and -- so help me -- Duel in the Sun into a blender and hits puree."
0,Impenetrable mess of a movie.
0,Eye of the Beholder suffers from blurry vision at best. Don't let your eyes behold it.
0,"This mangled project is neither great art nor grand entertainment but, because it floors the pedal for both, it has a certain resplendent awfulness."
0,Long on style but perilously short on logic and coherence.
0,"In trying to both inflame and indict our morbid curiosity, Elliott fails to make the needed connection between the audience and a peeper who has lost his moral balance."
0,"It's late January, winter is entrenched, and in the lull between the bounty of Christmas and the renewal of spring, the big screen can sometimes seem barren -- a movable famine."
0,"Remove the directorial flash and filigree, and its narrative would be easier to track."
0,The result is compellingly bonkers.
0,"As misogynistic as anything I've seen in ages, it's tricked up with enough fancy cinematography (by Guy Dufaux) to guarantee it sub-Hitchcockian credentials of the sort that some reviewers eagerly hand out to Brian De Palma."
1,Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration mixes farce and tragedy so completely that it challenges us to respond at all.
1,
1,"The Celebration rips apart the placid facade of a familiar subject, leaving its audience stunned. As difficult as the film can at times be, the patient viewer will be rewarded."
1,"At a time when filmmaking so often falls back on the familiar, its effect indeed manages to be excitingly inventive and pure."
1,
1,"An assured, admirably abrasive little movie which never outstays its welcome."
0,"The more this film's results are measured against its rhetoric, the more callow and unsatisfying it seems."
1,"A funny, volatile, visually dynamic story about the unraveling of one extended family during the course of a patriarchal 60th-birthday dinner."
1,I'll be thinking about this movie for a long time to come.
0,"But in spite of all that--and in spite of the artfully lit interviews and energetic musical score--the documentary resolves into an accumulation of names, dates, and mundane procedural detail."

1,Boiler Room is derivative and flawed. But it does throw off a few sparks.
1,"Writer-director Ben Younger experienced the sales pitch of a boiler room recruiter in real life. His fascination with the thrill-junkie life of these stock jocks is reflected in the script's sharp, arrogant dialogue."
1,Boiler Room is a new film that will yank anyone who's ever gotten a cold call from a chop shop.
0,"Last reel is particularly disappointing in its naive philosophy, manifest in Younger's rush to bring the various conflicts to satisfying closure."
0,"Despite Ribisi's success in giving Seth some sleepy-eyed, slouching charisma, we never really know what makes him tick."
0,A shallow script that never gets at the heart or conflict behind the swagger.
1,A compelling movie-going experience.
1,"In moviemaking, as in cold-calling, sometimes conviction is almost enough."
1,"The movie hums with authenticity, and knows a lot about the cultlike power of a company that promises to turn its trainees into millionaires, and certainly turns them into efficient phone salesmen."
1,Boiler's adrenaline rush film creates an elaborate stock scam.
1,A fast and funny look at a world where 'greed is good' has become the only reality in town.
0,"The movie draws from the works that preceded it, then takes to the street with a too-cool hip-hop strut."
1,"Boiler Room reflects the sensibility of the generation it holds up to critical scrutiny, and it's a cunningly ambiguous act of self-portraiture."
1,"Although the plotting gets a bit predictable toward the end, the script is intelligent and boldly written throughout."
1,It's the first film of the year capable of keeping a grown-up awake.
1,You won't find a movie that taps more directly into the jugular of the greed-fueled late '90s.
1,"What cooks about Boiler Room are the details, the ways these guys talk to each other and customers."
1,Boiler Room pays off with emotional dividends well worth the time investment.
1,"Younger draws a lot from David Mamet in his depictions of this seller's hothouse, but he does it with a twist: The salesmen here are fully conscious of being Mamet-y; their bible is Alec Baldwin's big, win-at-all-costs speech from...Glengarry Glen Ross."
1,Younger has a firmer grasp on the convoluted workings of pop and business (sub) cultures than many of his contemporaries.
0,"To put the movie in sales terms, after a good opening pitch, Younger fails to close the deal. The audience can't buy in."
1,"Turns of dialogue ring compellingly true, and the well chosen cast (especially Ribisi) carry the inflections of the drama with some style."
0,"Bottom line, this is American Pie for boys-will -be- boys in the fiftysomething age range."
0,"This movie wants to be sweet and dark at the same time, but it is as distant as a planet's satellite."
1,Shandling and director Mike Nichols find a funny new way of packaging the old truth in What Planet Are You From?
0,The only eruption this movie evokes is a loud yawn.
1,Easily the funniest movie of the year.
1,A testicle-tweaking satire on men trying to get in touch with feelings most of them didn't know they had.
1,Diverting.
1,"Consistently humorous, often downright funny."
0,Bogs down in weak dramaturgy about love and commitment.
0,"If you're expecting humor of the Sanders quality here, you won't get it, nor will you find that Shandling has a wide enough range as an actor."
0,Just what the universe needs. A movie that forces you to fixate on Garry Shandling's crotch.
0,"The picture barely works as a silly adult sex farce, it isn't nearly freewheeling and naughty enough."
0,"Here is the most uncomfortable movie of the new year, an exercise in feel-good smut. What Planet Are You From? starts out as a dirty comedy, but then abandons the comedy, followed by the dirt, and by the end is actually trying to be poignant."
1,A rather sweet fable about sincerity.
0,It's amazing that a movie with so many sex jokes can turn out to be so unfunny.
1,"Bening, even in a formula role like this one, is so lovable she actually makes you believe that she'd melt the resolve of a technocratic space visitor."
0,"The film just sort of lies there -- inspiration gone, premise spent, synthentic possibilities utterly exhausted."
0,Thirteen year-old boys would love the film if they could get into this R-rated picture.
0,"A film whose tone is out of sync with the simple, ribald conceit and is only mildly amusing at best."
0,"Has a lot of jokes that register intellectually, but rarely does it poke you in a place where you can't help but squeal."
0,How did smart people of proven talent make such a lame movie?
0,"Whatever planet produced this sex comedy, it's not indicating many signs of intelligent life."
0,
1,"Whitaker moves at two different speeds, as if the mind were impatient to get on to something worthier of its exertions while the body has been weighed down with the bad news a long past has lumped on it. It is an amazing performance."
0,Lame script.
0,The producers ... settle for the most obvious load of formula stuff in a numbingly cliched teen comedy pivoting on a lot of plastic angst over who'll take whom to the prom.
0,
0,"West, Franco, O'Keefe and Sokoloff are fine. It's just the dynamic of the callous jock/lovable oddball/stuck-up slut/sweet kid that reeks like a stale gym locker."
0,"If you saw a single John Hughes movie from the 1980s, you've already seen this territory covered with more style and insight."
0,This is the cinematic equivalent of those over-the-hill jocks who show up at their high school's game wearing a mothballed letter-jacket.
0,"What was that movie that finds humor in someone barfing on someone else? Give me a minute, it's on the tip of my tongue! Whatever It Takes."
0,"Although the leads are appealing, you're better off watching them for free on the little screen, in Once and Again...."
0,"Yet another leaden, witless, clich-drunk, teen romantic comedy."
0,A cinematic sour ball posing as bubblegum teen comedy.
0,"Whatever It Takes takes old tale, ruins it."
0,"The lightest, most forgettable item yet backed by Phoenix Pictures."
0,"Emotional falsehood permeates the picture, but at least the young actors are appealing."
0,"Like some kind of perverse cinematic plague, the teen comedies keep coming, each looking like a more washed-out xerox of the last one."
0,"Tepid, predictable fantasy."
0,Still another movie arguing that the American teenager's IQ level hovers in the low 90s.
1,"The geeky sidekicks in Whatever It Takes are no better or worse than those in a dozen other teen movies of recent vintage, but they get the job done."
0,An assembly-line high-school comedy that flunks miserably in all three subjects.
0,"You -- yes, you -- can write a teen comedy. Whatever It Takes is proof."
0,Falls flat with unbelievably bad scenes that are also just plain unbelievable.
1,There's something sweet and delightfully anarchic about it.
0,The script's way of handling its romantic complications is unusually obtuse and insensitive.
1,
0,What you're actually hearing is the sound of a really old coot preaching a very practised sermon.

1,Romantic sorrow -- and the self-reflexive dramas it inspires -- have rarely been this funny.
1,"Something that we can all laugh at -- sometimes raucously, sometimes tenderly, often ruefully."
1,There's a lot to enjoy in High Fidelity.
0,Isn't all that romantic and is only half as funny as it thinks it is.
0,There's not much to convince you that High Fidelity isn't a vanity production with some good tunes.
1,"A cute, quaint, at times rather silly movie that displays a genuine affection for the rebel-nerd scholasticism of record-store junkies."
1,The quirky High Fidelity really deserves being called the first must-see movie of the century.
0,"The insistent verbal nonsense among them wears thin very fast for folks who don't keep their vinyl collection in plastic sleeves. Absolutely, this is a romantic comedy that preaches to the converted."
1,Stands out as a 'small' motion picture that deserves wide exposure.
1,Every single actor here rises to the occasion.
1,Movies this wry and likable hardly ever get made.
1,High Fidelity easily cracks the top five list of reasons to go to the movies these days.
1,The movie is sparked by more than half a dozen incisive performances.
1,I enjoyed myself immensely.
1,Brilliant screen adaptation.
1,As smart as it is enjoyable.
1,"It's a sweet, raffish entertainment, blessedly free of baloney."
1,A Woody Allen film for youngish white males who fetishize rock music and its many memorabilia and have commitment problems when flesh-and-blood women.
1,"Had High Fidelity been a glorified one-act set in Rob's store, with a wealth of banter among these assorted losers to keep us laughing, it would still be a fine film. Lucky for us, there is so much more."
1,On the whole it's a fun film that is pretty much guaranteed as much success as the novel enjoyed.
1,"The British hero of Nick Hornby's novel, on which this movie is based, certainly does not scream out 'John Cusack.' And yet once you see him, you can't think of anyone who'd do it better."
1,Trenchantly witty and acutely insightful script.
1,High Fidelity is a sharp and satisfying romantic comedy about the difficulty of commitment that utilizes Stephen Frears' incisive direction and some very knowing and sophisticated writing to give actor Cusack one of the best roles of his career.
1,Created a doggedly faithful adaptation of Nick Hornby's cult-fave novel.
1,Cusack makes High Fidelity seem less self-indulgent than it is: It's impossible to imagine the movie without him.
1,"Cusack is a master at playing smart, frazzled, self-flagellating hipsters, and the movie, propelled by his arias of angst, lets him strut his best stuff."
1,Why not give it a spin?
1,It's hard to remember the last time guys were nailed so perceptively and dragged into adulthood so warmly and entertainingly.
1,The cast has been put together like a good band.
1,[The script] is constantly scathing and comically cynical without ever turning really ugly or bitter.
1,The film is superbly acted.
1,"There are a lot of wonderful supporting roles here, but the actor who'll get the most mileage is Jack Black in a career-setting turn as an obnoxious slacker."
1,"Cusack works especially well with the unknowns in the cast, while Frears creates an ensemble that complements Cusack's more flamboyant moments."
1,"With his passive presence and nervous eyes, Louiso is quietly hilarious. And Black, whose character is both arrogant and bombastic, is even funnier."
0,Stephen Frears ... seems on unsteady ground converting an essentially British story (the novel was set in London) to the American idiom.
0,It's got great music -- and great music trivia -- but a shaky soul.
1,You're still smiling when the film is over.
1,"A funny, perceptive movie about pop music, a man's confused passions for records and women, and the lure of perpetual teenagehood."
1,I enjoyed the film - twice! I related!
1,Mr. Frears has managed for the most part to retain the velocity of the narrative without sacrificing the psychological coherence of the characters.
1,If you can put up with all the archness and self-consciousness--there's quite a bit of both--this is an enjoyable romantic comedy.
1,"High Fidelity, with its knowing take on men, messed-up romance and music, is like one long, hook-filled pop song for the eyes."
1,"It is still a bit wimpy and sugary, but it's definitely entertaining, and the translation to American accelerates the tempo refreshingly."
1,"A film pragmatic enough to concede that almost every relationship is doomed, but romantic enough to realize that it's worth it to carry on in spite of that fact, High Fidelity is one of the smartest and funniest romantic comedies of the past few years."
0,"When happiness does arrive in this movie, it has the air not of something that you reach, like your top speed, but of something that you give in to, like baldness or old age."
1,"As for Mr. Cusack, there's nothing potential about his stardom any more. He's the self-doubting, self-flagellating, self-ironic soul of ""High Fidelity,"" and he's great."

0,"A generic, below-par chick flick."
0,Crappy writing and overall shoddy construction.
0,"Where the Heart Is has a screenplay like that, zigging and zagging and wildly careening from one melodramatic development to the next."
0,"It's too bad [Portman and Frain's] contributions, and those of many others, drown in a big glop of treacle."
0,Where the Heart Is fails to build much emotional momentum.
0,"The director, Matt Williams, does little to keep the audience from jumping ahead of the script."
1,Portman ... is remarkably persuasive as the unschooled Novalee.
1,The filmmakers have crafted a motion picture that should appeal to members of both sexes.
0,It appears to have been cobbled together from all the story lines the network sponsors wouldn't approve.
0,
0,Banal and trite where it could have been insightful and emotionally truthful.
0,Heart definitely lacks much of the earthy lyricism it's obviously striving for.
0,"Williams and the Ganz/Mandel team never establish a consistent tone, shuttling from funny scenes to serious ones so arbitrarily that the two moods cancel each other out."
0,"A swamp of clichs, contrivances, and cheap ham-and-cheese hero sentimentality."
0,"Serves up the usual homilies, but it lacks the quirky density and cinematic snap of, for instance, Jonathan Demme in his Melvin and Howard period."
0,Grand Guignol-on- trailer-wheels horror show.
0,"It evokes laughs and a few tears, but also groans at bad material."
0,"Watching Where the Heart Is, in fact, is a little like listening to the town gossip run her mouth about everyone she knows."
0,The moronic script by Lowell Ganz and 'Babaloo' Mandel has all the subtlety of a Hee Haw reunion and more schmaltz than a Catskills retirement home.
0,Where the Heart Is is everything that cynical moviegoers despise.
0,The movie isn't all that much -- it's too cloyingly ramshackle -- but Portman isn't playing down to her character this time around.
0,
0,"So much plot is crammed in, it's like a feature-length soap."
0,"The scenes feel forced, producing episodic plotting and calling attention to the characters' superficiality."
0,"Not possessing much in the way of a character arc, saints are boring to watch and impossible to act."
0,
0,"All in all, Committed lacks the courage of its convictions."
1,"In Committed [Graham] finally gets the chance to carry a movie, and she does so admirably."
0,"As [a] romantic comedy, it falls flat."
1,Ambiguous enough to let you contemplate the thin line between love and obsession.
1,Graham ... has a certain joyfully lively screen presence that saves the film from itself.
1,"With its capacity to surprise, the film comes to life when you don't expect it to."
0,"Overall, Committed is a disappointment."
0,"The romantic tale becomes redundant, with scripter Krueger struggling for inspiration -- and viewers quickly losing interest in her idiosyncratic protagonist."
1,"Until it backs itself into a narrative corner, Lisa Krueger's Committed. is a delightfully unpredictable experience."
0,"The movie is an inert screwball cartoon, a celebration of monogamy as fashion statement."
0,Neither the characters nor situations are as sympathetic or funny as writer-director Lisa Krueger seems to think.
0,"It's a one-joke premise that ultimately wears thin, but [Lisa] Krueger works some playful variations on a theme."
1,"Audaciously devised by writer-director Lisa Krueger, combines a gently surreal reverence for Americana with a serious examination of cultural values."
0,"The performers, including the very weird Casey Affleck and Goran Visnjic do their best to charm. But they're merely covering up for the movie's dramatic emptiness."
0,"[Lisa] Krueger's ambling, low-key style allows for a few incidental pleasures, the ever-watchable Casey Affleck chief among them, but without a single compelling reason to exist, Committed remains hollow at its core."
0,"For all its technical wonders, Dinosaur is strictly kids' stuff."
0,"For a story that takes place some 65 million years ago, Dinosaur is awfully reliant on recent recycled parts."
0,"If storytelling is the creative equivalent of water, I should point out it's no surprise these dinosaurs find themselves trekking over endless expanses of dusty, dry terrain."
1,One Dinosaur that won't soon be forgotten.
1,A certified wonder.
1,"Technical innovations notwithstanding, it''s basically a well-made kiddie flick."
0,"Once you get over the 'ooh-ah' factor and tuck into the ultraformulaic tale, Dinosaur is a dino-snore."
0,"You begin to get used to the film's pictorial wondrousness -- to take it for granted, even -- and start to realize that the characters and story are exceedingly mundane, unsurprising and pre-programmed."
0,Pure Disney formula.
0,The plot couldn't be more stale if it wafted from a sarcophagus.
1,The film is such a visual feast that it's often easy to ignore its narrative failings.
1,A feast for the eyes but a rather routine entry in the respectable folio of great Disney animated movies.
1,The picture is a dazzler.
1,"The experience is as luxuriant and intoxicating as a theme park ride; more remarkably, it feels like a real movie."
1,A serenely pleasing kiddie movie that invites little ones to sink into their dinosaur dreams.
1,I enjoyed the movie as sheer visual spectacle
1,"Even though the traditional aspects of cinema are lacking, it's hard not to be impressed by the package as a whole."
0,"Well, Bambi meets Godzilla again in the new computer-cartoon epic Dinosaur, but the results aren't so witty."
1,"Offers $200 million in special effects and a script worth about 2 cents. Still, that won't bother the picture's target audience."
1,One thing is certain: Disney has thrown down the gauntlet to the wave of animated competition coming this summer.
1,"Dinosaur astonishes and disheartens as only the most elaborate, most ambitious Hollywood products can."
1,"Dinosaur is a fable, and a hugely and sometimes wondrously watchable one, even if its emotions retreat to certain levels of programmed predictability as the film proceeds."
1,A must-see for anyone who wants to see the next stage in computer-generated animation.
1,This groundbreaking movie is nothing short of a visual miracle.
1,
1,"A visual breakthrough in realistic computer animation that should delight kids -- and adults, at least for the first half-hour."
1,Commendable weekend fare for the small fry.
0,"If studios are going to be paying out hundreds of millions of dollars for these films, shouldn't some of that money go to writers whose imaginations match the visuals?"
1,"While the film maintains a strong moral centre and never attempts to replicate the savage reality of such a situation, it still might be a little too scary for young audiences."
1,"If the devil is in the details, then this is one devilishly delightful film."
0,"Dinosaur cuts a bland, compliant figure, its narrative and characterizations subservient to splashy feats of CGI legerdemain."
0,It wouldn't have hurt to spend some of that money to tell a story as original as the movie's design -- though I'm sure I speak for millions in thanking Disney for not including any stupid songs.
1,Aurally and visually this creature feature is a treat.
0,"If this is how they want to squander a hard-earned opportunity, they should keep their day jobs."
0,"A shrill, stupid, brickbat-blatant piece of hackwork that practically sweats to be 'commercial.'"
0,Danny DeVito is the only cast member who succeeds in making something out of the movie's nothing of a screenplay.
0,Screwed is latenight cable TV filler disguised as a feature film.
1,Almereyda never plays up the gimmickry at the expense of the performances.
1,"Oddly enough it's the picture's visuals -- its mournful, glassy Manhattan high-rises; its limos and Town Cars with their mirrorlike flanks -- that make it feel most like Hamlet."
1,"In OUR time, the sinister turn of events at the Denmark Corporation couldn't be more apt."
0,"Although it's virtually impossible to make a bad movie based on a play as strong as Hamlet, Almereyda almost succeeds."
0,"In the end this noble experiment fails, not for its adventure but for its ultimate lack thereof."
0,"But the joke only goes so far, and even at a relatively svelte 112 minutes Hamlet comes apart in its final third."
0,Visually flat.
1,Provocative!
0,Embarrassingly sophomoric.
0,This is one Hamlet that was not meant to be.
1,
0,"Ultimately, I don't think that Michael Almereyda's modern-day adaptation of Hamlet really works, but it's a lot of fun along the way."
1,Vital and sharply intelligent.
1,A moody and compelling update of Shakespeare's classic.
1,"Almereyda has pulled off a formidable coup: He's made Shakespeare come alive for contemporary audiences of all ages, especially young people."
0,Just not quite daring or spectacular enough.
1,"By equating the garish feudalism of the play's original setting with the megalopolis of today's New York, [Almereyda is] at least on the right track. The problem is, it's just about his only track."
1,"The result is more than a mere gimmick and less than an unqualifed success, but yes -- it's always watchable."
1,"Icy-cold in its palette and unwaveringly cool in its application of modern settings and gizmos to a text that stands up to endless reinvention, this is a Hamlet that brings imagination matched by thoughtfulness to its appeal to both eye and ear."
1,"Almereyda modernises and streamlines without trivializing, and amplifies poetic melodrama with regular ingenuity and energy."
1,The lines are read for the most part with more feeling for the angry-stepchild plot than for the iambic pentameter.
1,It could prove almost as definitive -- and far more easily digestible -- than Branagh's textually complete version.
1,"I like the way the material has truly been ""adapted"" to its modern setting without the language being adulterated."
1,The movie takes a slice out of the American Pie recipe book by at least making the final screen product funnier than the trailer.
1,
0,"Road Trip is broadly amusing with a few bright spots. But those can't cover up the major gaps in storytelling, characterization and laughs."
0,"Road Trip is nothing more than a series of sight gags and put-downs. It's often funny, but it never has anything smart to say."
1,On the whole it works because its over-the-top humor is supported by the filmmakers' ability to view life with a clear-eyed lack of sentimentality.
1,"It's no masterpiece, you understand, but it doesn't count on the raging hormones of its audience to do all of its work."
0,"Although lively at times, the proceedings are far too perfunctory to generate a 'can-you-top-this' quality. The result is a film that knows some of the words, but not the music."
1,"Still, although the subject matter is sophomoric it has enough of a plot and key performances to humor more sophisticated moviegoers too."
0,"As objectionable as its subject matter is, the most objectionable thing is that it's not funny."
0,"As the guys continue on their way to Texas, this Road Trip degenerates into a slow-moving game of connect-the-gross-outs."
1,"Road Trip rides the wave of popularity for base, politically incorrect, outrageous humor."
0,"Road Trip occasionally wills itself to rude, crude life. But most of the time it's pretty limp."
1,"Scott and Green seem to be having the most fun, but the entire cast is energetic and the movie feeds on that enthusiasm."
1,Road Trip ... celebrates the triumph of hedonistic righteousness in a world where it already rules.
1,"The movie is sloppily made, but there's almost a sly charm to the sloppiness, and the unevenness of the filmmaking doesn't detract from the picture's most obvious laughs."
1,"Multiplexes should be thronged with howling, high-fiving young men deep into summer."
1,"Road Trip may not be an ambitious film, but it doesn't lack for imagination, and the nasty edge of its comedy makes it refreshing."
1,"Road Trip takes a well-traveled highway, but the drivers know exactly what they're doing."
0,"Road Trip is mellow and dirty, which is the wrong combination."
1,"As we all know, bad taste is timeless. And sometimes it can be so funny that you can't help laughing."
1,"Road Trip is the best dumb party movie of the year; if that's what you've been craving, buckle up."
1,"Road Trip may not have the all-time-classic status of Animal House, but it's frequently as funny."
0,
0,"Saddled with an annoying and extensive narration track, added for fear kids couldn't follow the story without constant guidance."
1,The best and most thoughtful family movie so far this year.
0,"Saddled with actor Lukas Haas, who delivers a lifeless first-person-or first-horse-narration."
0,"The human actors are colourless, the pacing lifeless, and the drama stillborn."
0,
0,Running Free is the only evidence anyone will ever need to demonstrate what a ruinous trend wallpapered narration has become.
1,Beautiful scenery and extraordinarily appealing shots of horses make Running Free worth a trip to the multiplex.
0,
0,"This movie might have been more persuasive if the boy had told the story of the horse, instead of the horse telling the story of the boy."
0,"Until we really know what animals are thinking, it's probably best to leave talking animal stories in the care of comedic filmmakers."

0,"This may, in fact, be the junkiest film in history to star three Academy Award winners."
0,"Gone in 60 Seconds plays like a picture made by the numbers, for the numbers."
0,Cage has found a movie to challenge Snake Eyes and Eight Millimeter as the dumbest of his career.
0,"This should have been a fun movie: clean and tight and simple. Instead, it's an occasionally amusing comedy with the usual Bruckheimer nerve-plucking going on."
0,An especially bad screenplay.
0,A time-waster with some enjoyably empty zip.
0,So mired in his own ludicrous equation for contemporary action pictures that it's constantly stuck in first gear.
0,Never before has a promising cast been wasted so shamelessly.
0,Has the energy of a dead battery.
0,No one is likely to confuse Gone in 60 Seconds with a good action movie.
0,"The script by Scott Rosenberg (Con Air) starts out stringing together underworld cliches and, about midpoint when it becomes obvious nothing is working, turns on itself in a desperate attempt at self-parody."
0,Weighted down with a new chassis of cliches.
0,The dialogue is so cheesy it needs crackers.
0,"It's a movie that could honestly be said to star cars, not actors."
0,"Gone in 60 Seconds, a car theft caper starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie's lips, is slickly produced pornography for the sports car lover, and little more."
1,A warm-weather guilty pleasure.
0,"Chases are big, but -- with one exception, which stands out for its determination to bring in da noise -- joyless."
0,"Like all Jerry Bruckheimer films, Gone In 60 Seconds has a slick look but no soul."
0,This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.
0,Doesn't rise to the level of its excellent trailer.
0,"Slow this movie down long enough for people to get up to buy popcorn, and they might change their minds and go straight home."
1,
0,A B-movie remodeling of a Z-grade drive-in crash classic from 1974.
1,Mindless hot-rodding fun.
1,The action all fits into the overall story and isn't just stuck in for the hell of it.
0,The movie doesn't just look and sound like a car commercial. It is a car commercial.
0,"Gone in 60 Seconds does have its moments, but they last about as long as the title implies."
1,The movie's seemingly absurd setup works better than you might guess because the filmmakers and actors never take it completely straight-line.
1,"Discounting certain holiday-themed movies, there has rarely been a film so in touch with the season of its release as Gone in 60 Seconds."
0,Most of the thefts are unimaginative in conception and execution.
0,Isn't going to make anyone forget the classic chases in Bullitt or The French Connection.
0,A product that will delight car junkies and drive cinephiles to swear off film until fall.
0,Sixty seconds is all a professional car thief needs to steal a car. It takes about the same time for a moviegoer to know he or she is watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
0,"Where the original had too many car chases and not enough plot or characterisation, this has too much plot, too many characters and not enough metal crunching, tyre squealing action."
0,"Perfectly dreadful in every respect, this big-budget remake of the late H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie hit may well rep the nadir of the Bruckheimer (and Simpson) franchise, and doesn't even rate on the most basic level as a good car-chase picture."
1,I found it more pleasurable as a time waster than either Mission: Impossible.
0,"In this film we learn that it takes 8,000 lbs. of pressure to crush a car but only one credited screenwriter (Scott Rosenberg) to pound out such a lame script."
0,"What's missing from Gone in 60 Seconds is anything new. There's a ""been there, done that"" feeling to the enterprise."
1,Mr. Green has a sense of proportion and taste. No scene goes on for a beat longer than it should.
1,"It offers a generous amount of treasures, if you summon the patience to sit through it."
1,
1,"It remembers a summer that was not a happy summer, but there will never again be a summer so intensely felt, so alive, so valuable."
1,"Not like any other movie. That, in itself, makes it something to see."
1,"A work of startling originality that will haunt you for a good, long time."
0,"You want to like the film more, but, unfortunately, it just moves too slowly, not enough happens and the characters just don't have enough interesting or original things to say."
1,"On the basis of this stunningly impressive feature debut, [director Green] is set to become a Terrence Malick for the 21st century, reviving the values of artistry and reflectiveness in American indie cinema."
1,Brave and thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing.
1,"One of the most striking and affecting American independent films of the year, heralding the arrival of a formidable young talent in Green."
0,A gracious sleepwalk of a movie that could have used a firmer strut.
1,It's possible to keep one's feet on the ground and still appreciate the film's quiet verbal and visual poetry.
1,The film absorbs elements of documentary and improvisation to produce a remarkably organic whole.
0,"Amid languorous style, the story gets lost, which is a pity because it could have been a nice quirky one."
1,"You have to bring a lot of yourself to this film if you want it to give something back, but the rewards are considerable."
0,Undistinguished and uninvolving attempt to offer a rural spin on Kids.

0,[Covers] too many bases.
1,Shaft pushes our buttons which means it's something that has been next to unheard-of this year: reasonably rousing screen entertainment.
0,The story becomes a mess about halfway through.
0,"John Singleton may have been the youngest director ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, but I wouldn't exactly call him a natural-born filmmaker."
1,What really clicks are some of the stars.
1,"Unlike other summer movies, the action here mostly is as real and rugged as bullets and fists."
1,A slight but entertaining update.
1,"Finally, someone has remembered how to remake a slick, bang-bang action movie."
1,Its sheer balls-out bravado is often brutally funny.
1,Singleton shows enough in Shaft to indicate he can make this kind of motion picture.
1,"If nothing else, Shaft is spicy fast food."
0,The current version tries awfully hard but with little success to create a Shaft for this day and age.
1,Few stars of late have displayed more sheer joy in a mainstream project than Jackson does here.
1,"This new Shaft has the stuff to grab its audience in a big way, maybe even opening up a new franchise."
0,Whenever he [Jackson] isn't on the screen -- which isn't much -- the movie flags.
1,The surprise is that the movie doesn't just rely on Jackson. Shaft has everything.
0,"Is this a good movie? Not exactly; too much of it is on automatic pilot, as it must be, to satisfy the fans of the original Shaft."
1,
1,"Sleek, urgent, knowing, gleefully profane and above all ultra-cool, Shaft blows into the summer movie season like a breath of fresh air."
1,It's fun and a good deal better than the fondly remembered original.
1,It's hard to remember so unapologetically flamboyant a movie.
1,A decent popcorn movie.

1,"It's never boring, and it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance."
0,"Gibson gives the part his all, but he can't create a coherent character: the movie won't let him."
1,A rip-snorting good flick that breaks the cinematic jinx against Revolutionary War stories.
1,The Patriot delivers what it promises.
1,"Every moment leads naturally to the next, and the overall effect is thrilling."
0,"A gruesome hybrid, a mix of sentimentality and brutality that suggests a Lethal Weapon movie directed by Norman Rockwell."
0,Gibson gives a mechanically precise but soulless performance in which he seems more concerned with how he looks than what his character is thinking or feeling.
1,"Having fought the British centuries before in Braveheart, Gibson brings the same intensity to The Patriot."
1,It wisely focuses upon common folk rather than prominent figures.
0,"It seems certain that whatever extraordinary ingredients are necessary to fashion a 1776 home run, this movie doesn't have them."
1,It boldly asks what you'd be willing to sacrifice to gain that freedom. And what more could you ask from a Fourth of July movie?
1,It has everything you want in an epic.
1,"The Patriot is a huge, bloody, 2-hour-and-40-minute battle epic, lavishly appointed and beautifully shot."
1,
1,Gibson has proven he can do this kind of stuff with his eyes closed and he is rounded out by a fine supporting cast.
0,"What makes The Patriot exhausting, despite its handful of blood-boiling sequences, is the way it numbingly resembles other movies."
0,"A movie of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial Williamsburg sets."
0,"The period dcor and costuming and production design may be in the overhoned Hollywood classic style, but the plotting is pure melodrama."
0,The rules of summer movie-making wreck The Patriot.
0,"There's no majesty, no tragedy, no feeling here; it's all FX and costuming and casting directors."
0,
0,"It's not being unpatriotic to wish for a better, more original movie."
0,"Yet for its real virtues, The Patriot is never completely satisfying."
1,"I enjoyed the strength and conviction of Gibson's performance, the sweep of the battle scenes, and the absurdity of the British caricatures."
0,"Reflects our wish to redeem ourselves through sacrifice. But that entails more than briefly nodding to our flaws, magnifying what we like best about our past, and waving it around, hoping the euphoria will resolve any contradictions."
1,"As long as it stays on the battlefield, The Patriot is a brutishly compelling broad-canvas entertainment."
0,There's not much to get excited about.
1,Emmerich choreographs the action with breathtaking precision.
1,Deserves a salute as the first Hollywood epic about the American Revolution to successfully blend ferocity and feeling.
1,A grand yarn with a sense of the weight of history and an awareness that the winners are often those who have lost the most.
0,"Make no mistake about it: The Patriot is a cartoon, even if it does have real people playing the parts."
0,"Emmerich's battle scenes may look authentic to anyone who has ever stared hard at a history book, but in every other way the film is long, empty and bogus."

0,"Besides bad writing and bad acting, the lighting is poor and the colors are faded."
0,What on earth possessed anyone to put it on the big screen?
0,It pretty much makes Wild Things look like Jane Austen.
0,"It's so bad that even the kids, who (let's face it) aren't a very discriminating audience, were hooting at it during an opening-day screening."
0,"The earnest efforts of director Mary Lambert and her cast cannot keep this languid psychological drama, set at a posh Southern resort, from seeming trite and uninvolving."
0,There's little noteworthy.
0,A country-club member takes a club employee under her wing in this cagey formula thriller that exploits homosexuality better than murder-mystery clues.
0,"The In Crowd isn't a movie, it's Gorgonzola, a crumbly summertime stinker veined with pop-cultural fungus."
0,"The press release makes a ""special request"" to not reveal the ending. They didn't need to worry. Anyone over PG-13 age is going to know exactly where this movie is going long before it gets there."
0,Late-night Cinemax fare inexplicably granted a theatrical release.

1,"After an uproarious first half, Saving Grace arrives at its conclusion somewhat hastily and conveniently. But to its credit, it still maintains a sunny comic mellow."
1,It's a breezy and entertaining little charmer that works because it's not rendered on too precious a scale.
1,Crowd-pleasing enough to provide a pleasant buzz.
1,"The familiar, derivative feel is in part offset by a hard-to-deny level of appeal."
0,"We're left with a promising idea for a comedy, which arrives at some laughs but never finds its destination."
1,Saving Grace has a charm that keeps you involved throughout.
1,"Take away the marijuana, and what you have in Saving Grace is a comedy of the old school and, depending on your view of the current state of screen humor, that's either a promise or a warning."
1,"Without her humanity and comic timing, Saving Grace could have been a silly puff-ball. With Ms. Blethyn and a talented ensemble, it has the makings of a Full Monty-type sleeper."
1,"Beautifully shot on location with sure comic timing by director Nigel Coles, Saving Grace is a real high in a season filled with unfunny comedies."
1,A modestly effective comedy.

1,"Frothy, silly, ever so slightly subversive and purely delightful."
1,"There is nothing profound in this movie, but it shines through so many of this summer's dumb Hollywood comedies like a beacon through a haze of smoke."

1,"The Art of War keeps us reasonably entertained, if not guessing."
0,Somebody get this director Christian Duguay an A-budget so he'll shut up and go away.
0,"Sun Tzu said, 'Be subtle! Be subtle! And use your spies for every kind of business!' And 'ponder and deliberate before you make a move.' Alas, Sun Tzu didn't have script approval on this mess."
0,"The Art of War seems to be processed through some demented kaleidoscope, suggesting a film that might exist while the one that does is giving you a headache."
0,"The movie is competently made, but it deals with characters and situations so well-worn, there is no conceivable way to breathe any fresh life into them."
0,"Gun battles, explosions, car chases, running races ad infinitum. Also lots of breaking glass. All this punctuated by thunderous music and sometimes thunder itself."
1,"French Canadian director Christian Duguay does not display an original idea in the entire film, but he's a slick synthesist who melds various styles effectively and sustains a mood of deepening paranoia."
0,"Ludicrous, impenetrable and headache-inducing: the newest Wesley Snipes film, The Art of War, is all that and more."
0,The Art of War makes no sense at all.
0,A disgustingly violent morass of high-tech beatings and killings.
0,"Overly plotted and too coincidence-ridden for a story that's basically about nothing, this is a film that almost is not there."
0,"The audio gambits are so commanding that at times, you forget that they're just about the only thing gripping your attention."
1,"The Art of War manages to entertain without being enriching, and, at least in some circles, that's the definition of what a summer film is supposed to accomplish."
1,Involves the audience with a hugely enjoyable central performance.
1,"With charisma, acting ability and physical prowess to spare, Mr. Snipes is in a league of his own and makes a mediocre movie worth watching simply by stepping in front of the camera."
1,"I'm happy to report that while it's deeply flawed, it's not by any means a bad film."
0,Duguay's grotesque excess of visual and aural noise squelches thought.
0,"Quickly falls into B-picture visual cliche, accompanied by leaden dialogue, as it simplifies its ambitious story for the sake of too many shootouts and overblown chases."
0,Christian Duguay has spent way too much time studying frenetic 60-second commercials and Hong Kong martial arts movies to remember how to make a lucid tale.

0,"""10 Cent Pistol"" serves as a perfect example of getting what you pay for."
1,"Even if this tale might have been better served as a 40-minute short than as a full-length movie, first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg has cast a trio of actors at the top of their game, and they elevate the material."
1,"Although some may miss the immediacy of a rampaging kaiju destroying everything in its path, this is an entirely different breed of movie that's potentially even more effective for its shift in style and tone."
1,"It's lean, and taut, and tense, and moves with Swiss-clock precision. Still, it's not as scary as you want it to be."
1,A sensationally effective semi-sequel that bears virtually no narrative or stylistic resemblance to its predecessor ...
1,"For the love of Google, don't scour the web for third-act spoilers. Just know that an old-fashioned scary movie can still make you squirm, laugh and gasp for air."
1,"As a gamelike, simulationist PG-13 horror chamber piece, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a success: well shot and -staged, arrestingly acted, edited with a crisp unpredictability."
1,"Winstead also makes a terrific heroine; her character is a problem-solver, not a freaker-outer, and it's a stressful sort of fun watching her devise one plan after another to get around Howard's creepy patriarchal rules."
1,"Take away the disappointing, disjointed, and anti-climactic final act, and this is an effective white-knuckle psychological thriller."
1,"It is designed to be fun, efficient and accessible and delivers precisely and exactly on that and nothing more."
1,"Winstead gives a strong performance as a captive who never gives up her fight. Goodman strikes a fine balance between nurturing caregiver and frightening captor, even if, to the detriment of the story, his end game is never really made clear."
1,"Trachtenberg ratchets up the tension with ease, and even small things are filled with a stomach-turning dread that keeps the film chugging along until its explosive last act."
1,"This is a work of immense confidence, and the restraint Trachtenberg asks of his leads is remarkable -- Winstead and Goodman quietly excel in what could have easily been wild, loud caricatures."
1,"The more you know about it, the less fun it will be."
1,"Goodman's very good, taking care of job one, which is to keep us guessing Howard's intentions. And Winstead is even better, within the parameters of this genre mashup."
1,"Producer J.J. Abrams, a brilliant marketer, has to eventually open his ""mystery box,"" and the intelligence plummets. Never mind that. Go anyway and watch the arrival of the mighty Winstead, who'd do fine in a Room of her own."
1,the movie comes loaded with everything a psychological thriller needs to shatter your nerves - and then kicks it up a notch.
0,"Just serviceable bunker thriller that asks the question, ""Would you want to survive The Big One if it meant being stuck [underground] with the kind of guy who spent his life preparing to survive The Big One?"""
1,"Trachtenberg and his screenwriters, Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken, take advantage of the shelter's tight quarters, which contribute to the expected pressure-cooker atmosphere of suspicion and hostility but also open up the punch-drunk comedy ..."
1,"Above all 10 Cloverfield Lane is a showcase for Goodman, a consummate actor whose ability to terrify has rarely been exploited so thoroughly."
1,"From its Hitchcock opening to its eye-popping ending, Dan Trachtenberg's feature debut keeps us wondering about what's really going on, even as we root for Mary Elizabeth Winstead's spunky entrapped protagonist."
1,A master class on narrative pacing and carefully managed jolts.
1,"Goodman's performance, while unhinged, never veers into caricature. Similarly, Winstead avoids the cliche of the tank-top-wearing bimbo/victim, bringing an earthy self-reliance to her role."
1,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is as economical as a stage play but packs in plenty of visceral violence and visual surprises. Whether you've seen the first film or not, this one is a thoroughly entertaining treat."
1,"Trachtenberg scares the wits out of us a few times, and then he launches into a climax that will have many talking -- though I found it somewhat disappointing, a little predictable, and frustratingly baffling. But you might love it."
0,"Rather than something truly wild and way, way off the wall, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a variation on the ""don't go down into the basement"" school of scary moviemaking, only this time with a 180-degree twist."
1,The film zips between claustrophobic tension and nervous laughs with hoverfly agility.
1,"There's a fine, nerve-jangling little psychological thriller here. Pity it couldn't have been allowed to just be that."
1,"Unpredictability in cinema is frequently a missing element -- especially when we're talking about movies that fall into the horror or science-fiction genres. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, there is no such problem. Trust me."
1,"At one point, this movie had me so on edge that I had a fleeting impulse to run out of the theater. It might be weird to say that and mean it as a compliment, but good thrillers work that way sometimes."
1,"The best reveal of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that the script from Josh Campbell, Matthew Steucken and Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash"") is strong enough to have made a compelling stageplay instead of a creature feature."
1,Thumpingly exhilarating ...
1,"Not an outright Cloverfield sequel but rather, as Abrams has put it, a ""spiritual successor."" It's also a better movie, one with a sense of humor about itself and its genre."
1,"Trachtenberg is patient building this world, and the actors do a good job inhabiting it."
1,"I sure hope there's an ""11 Cloverfield Lane."""
1,A well-crafted affair by debuting director Dan Trachtenberg that mixes elements of an intimate stage play with the white-knuckled tension of a cracking good Twilight Zone episode.
1,"This is rock-solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing and jumping for 100 minutes before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending."
1,"Tamp down those expectations, then tamp them down some more."
1,"All three actors are tremendous, and director Dan Trachtenberg, making his feature debut, must be commended for keeping things tightly focused."
1,"Put this down, close this tab, go to your local multiplex and just buy a ticket. Even better if you haven't seen more than a teaser trailer. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, proceed directly to the theater."
0,"Great publicity, dumb move. The title alone is a spoiler."
1,10 Cloverfield Lane does what it needs to do: make you sit and squirm and want very badly to know. It has the appeal of suspense radio plays from the '30s and '40s and even a touch of Orson Welles's most infamous Mercury Theater broadcast.
1,The horrors of that bunker far outweigh anything that could be waiting for them outside. Sometimes what is right in front of you is plenty terrifying enough.
1,"10 Cloverfield Lane is rewardingly claustrophobic, keeping its focus tight on the characters and their cramped space while whatever disasters there are loom outside the bunker."
1,"Trachtenberg ... smothers the action in showy camera work and an overly insistent music score. But, as the mystery unravels, he reveals flashes of a giddily hyperbolic pop imagination."
1,A smart and tense chamber piece that builds suspense carefully.
1,"After a particularly dull Oscar season, this is a refreshing and extremely satisfying palette cleanser."
0,"Don't give away the secret of this J.J. Abrams production, which begins as one sort of movie before turning into another sort of movie but manages to be continuously bad."
0,"By the end, 10 Cloverfield Lane feels like a marketing plan posing as a movie."
1,"In an era of bloated blockbusters, 10 Cloverfield Lane is refreshingly pared down -- a chamber piece rather than an epic."
1,A wildly entertaining genre mash-up.
1,"10 Cloverfield Lane alternates moods seamlessly, ratcheting tension to the breaking point and then deflating it with black humor."
1,"It works best whenever Goodman swaggers into frame, a slack-jawed psycho with a cuddly side."
0,The title of this movie proves unusually apt: You will figure out its climactic plot twist within the first 10 minutes.
0,"""10 Minutes Gone"" is clumsy and clich챕-ridden, and populated by two accomplished action stars who look like they just want to get through this job as quickly as possible."
0,"Wearing the same pained expression the actor adopts for most of these low-budget features, Willis seems to grimace through every scene only as long as necessary to collect a paycheck."
1,"A nicely crafted, economic (it's only 85 minutes) introduction to that most eminent of men, the spiritual leader and deposed head of state of Tibet."
1,"One comes away from 10 Questions emboldened, energized, and sadder -- aware that peace remains so radical a concept that most of us aren't yet worthy of it."
0,"The film never rises above the spiritual or intellectual level of a TV news anchor. It is a dispiriting film to watch, if you have any real interest in the subject."
1,"There have been several documentaries about the Dalai Lama, but few have done a better job of packaging the Tibetan religious leader's circumstances, both historical and current, along with his philosophies, than 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama."
0,The 11th question would be: Does a TV-grade travelogue followed by a halfway-decent Q&A warrant a theatrical release?
1,"""10 Questions for the Dalai Lama"" is a tedious title for an anything-but-tedious film that expertly merges the mystical and the mundane."
1,"Part history lesson and part profile, the film presents a concise, cogent account of recent Tibetan history as well as an engrossing onscreen conversation with one of the world's great spiritual leaders."
1,10 Questions works extremely well as an introduction to the Dalai Lama and offers a tantalizing peek at the dynamic and even mischievous personality of this influential man.
0,"The whole film is pretty enraging, hideously acted apart from the main quartet, and ends up viewing like a particularly racy Lifetime Original."
0,The movie doesn't work even as an instructional video.
0,"A dreadful sex farce with barely an authentic emotion, credible character or plausible plot point in its midst."
0,This retrograde sex comedy is embarrassing for just about everyone involved ...
0,A numbingly unfunny sex farce
0,The high school romance genre has become so popular that it's running out of new ideas and has taken to recycling classic literature.
1,"No one in this film is a big star, but everyone is a capable actor."
1,"Stiles, whose slightly rushed, impatient delivery sometimes recalls the young Jane Fonda, lets enough sweetness seep into her portrayal to lend even the nastiest retort a hint of forgiveness."

1,"Debut film director Gil Junger may be a TV veteran making a movie for the Clearasil crowd, but he doesn't sacrifice the story to gimmicky camerawork or overzealous pacing."
1,Miller is outstanding as a father who is utterly convinced that dating is the first step towards instant and complete moral and sexual decay.
1,"As satirical as it is romantic, this is one teen film that is wise enough to span generations in its appeal."
0,"The notion of a contemporary high school as a hotbed of romantic intrigue is utterly apt, and the performances almost make the update work."
0,The movie wimped out by blanding down the story and the characters to the point where she isn't really a shrew and he isn't really a maniac.
1,"Stiles nails her feminazi, bound-for-Sarah Lawrence shtick, but just as easily melts into giggles or pulls off a slapstick drunk scene."
1,Stiles grows into her character and Ledger is effortlessly charming.
0,At times the pic doesn't even seem certain which decade it's set in; the squeaky-clean high school environs often feel more '80s than '90s.
1,"The film's crank-case snappishness doesn't break any molds, but it certainly gives you a lift."
1,"Quirky, inventive, and brimming over with clever visual gags and colorful supporting characters, 10 Things uses Shakespeare as a jumping-off point to playfully send up a society that doesn't know what to do with a strong woman."
1,"A movie that looks outward, that leads you elsewhere, out of the self, toward literature and life."
1,"A witty reworking of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew in the form of a modern-day screwball teen comedy, Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate about You actually owes very little to the original beyond basic plot points and a handful of names."
1,"10 Things I Hate About You can and should be viewed as the ultimate teen movie, bursting through the hellish decade to say a little more about the empowering potential of those defining years."
1,"10 Things is a bright little romantic comedy, nicely and sharply written, which wears its learning winningly and lightly."
1,[Stiles] is quite successful in the role and well-matched with Ledger.
1,"Jamie Linden's minor-key serio-comedy pulls us in eventually, delivering its share of poignant insights and melancholy reflections, even if it does all feel a tad familiar."
0,Less fun than a funeral.
1,"There's a relaxed, unforced, melancholy sweetness and swing to this modest iteration of the Big Chill/Return of the Secaucus 7 formula, a pleasing directorial debut for screenwriter Jamie Linden."
1,A strong cast convincingly captures the many ways in which adulthood proves far more complicated than what's imagined at 18.
1,"An amiable, seriocomic high-school-reunion movie, 10 Years succeeds in pulling off a fine varsity talent show."
1,"There's a lot of been-there, done-that going on. That said, this very distant, slightly more youthful cousin to The Big Chill presents a convincing version of a 10-year high school reunion."
1,"An unpretentious, well-acted ensemble piece that doesn't aspire to be a portentous generational time capsule like ""The Big Chill,"" ""American Graffiti"" or ""Diner."""
1,"10 Years does nothing noteworthy, but it does it well, thanks to its ensemble cast."
0,"Needless to say, everybody comes equipped with their very own overweight baggage; old grudges are revived, new ones are invented; and big personal revelations -- most of which you can see coming a mile away -- arrive on cue."
0,"It's too bad 10 Years isn't, you know, funny."
1,Even when the script seems ready to settle for clich - with cavemen guys being civilized by the more evolved women in their life - it takes a slight detour.
0,"Is there anything less narratively interesting than a high school reunion that focuses exclusively on the beautiful and popular crowd? Who all now seem to be leading normal, if flawed, lives?"
1,Writer/director Jamie Linden and his excellent cast beautifully evoke the sentimental magic inherent in their scenario.
1,'10 Years' is a surprisingly solid variation on a familiar tune.
1,"Even the most exhausted, hackneyed and innately annoying genre can yield a film of breezy charm and prickly dramatic consequence."
0,An inconsequential high-school-reunion comedy that gets better when it stops trying to make you laugh.
1,"Linden manages to overcome what would seem to be a premise fraught with peril with a lot of help from a likable cast, making ""10 Years"" a surprisingly enjoyable movie."
1,"A bracingly un-gimmicky, heartfelt and fresh take on the theme of growing up."
1,"10 Years is no Big Chill, but it has just enough warmth to keep it alive."
0,"A turgid, ketchup-spattered dud."
0,"Pic throws together gangster archetypes and set pieces, relying heavily on exposition to stand in for character development."
0,"A grisly gangster movie with moral pretensions, 10th and Wolf never transcends mobster cliches recycled from The Godfather, Donnie Brasco and GoodFellas."
0,Anyone who's seen a mob movie or TV show in the past 30 years has pretty much seen 10th & Wolf.
0,"Bobby Moresco, who cowrote Crash and coproduced Million Dollar Baby, makes an undistinguished directing debut, assembling a band of actors who know but two modes: simmering rage and over-the-top histrionics."
0,"A mix of the first half of Donnie Brasco, the last 20 minutes of A History of Violence and a couple of episodes of I Love the'90s."
0,"The movie doesn't miss a clich, ineptly lifting liberally from The Godfather and GoodFellas, among other classics."
0,"At this late date, filmmakers who draw inspiration from the Mafia had better have a whole new angle to offer. Otherwise, they'll end up with a movie like 10th & Wolf."
1,10th & Wolf alternates between being bloody good and just plain bloody.
0,"A played-out saga of guns, gangsters and goofball actors pretending to be tough guys."
0,A hellish and unconvincing celebration of badda-bing-ness.
0,A routine mob thriller.
1,"""10x10"" overcomes limited locations and a slight narrative thanks to a plot that keeps viewers guessing, all the way from its shocking opening act of violence to a bruising and morally hazy final fight."
0,"The opening scenes of this thriller look and feel like something I've seen dozens, maybe hundreds, of times before."
1,A critic can't say much about this movie except it works up a good amount of lather and how much you like it will depend on how surprised you are by its zigs and zags.
0,Numbingly incoherent.

1,"Despite its genre trappings, Bait is an entertaining and occasionally clever picture with a crackling peformance by Jamie Foxx."
0,Fuqua has enveloped the luckless Jamie Foxx ... in a stylishly inept mess of a movie; a film as badly flawed in concept as it is incoherent in execution.
0,This film wastes a lot of good actors.
0,Fuqua draws from so many disparate genres to energize the film that fusion gives way to confusion.
0,"Thanks to Antoine Fuqua's ... feverish and self-indulgent MTV-inspired direction, with its desperate overreliance on close-ups, you just can't tell what's going on."
0,"Ultimately, it's Foxx's insistence on filling any dead air with wisecracks that spoils Bait."
0,It piles one ludicrous plot twist atop another and bothers not a whit with logic.
0,"Blending comedy and action is a formula that works when both elements are strong, as in, say, Beverly Hills Cop or 48 Hours. In Bait, this isn't the case."
0,"He's hilarious, but through the jokes, you get the sense Foxx knows he deserves better."
0,Director Antoine Fuqua ... is left buried just as surely as those very unlikely gold bars.
0,"If the movies that make 'best lists' are filet mignon, the culinary comparison here probably is bait."
0,Watching [the events] unfold is like being at the mercy of a compulsive channel surfer who can't stop flipping between a bad UPN cop show and a stock WB sitcom.
0,Director Antoine Fuqua ... serves up every cliche in the book.

0,"It's just respectable trash, and a dress rehearsal for better things ahead."
1,"It's funny and clever, and it grows on you."
1,Two things pretty much save the movie. The last 40 minutes are well-plotted and paced. And Foxx is enormously likable.
0,"Bait makes a fatal mistake, one this kind of movie should never make unless it actually is The Matrix or Terminator 2: Judgment Day: It's long."
1,"Stands out for refusing to settle for the narcissism of Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence movies, instead addressing human vulnerabilities."
1,
0,"If you want a conflicted movie that doesn't know what it is -- or just wish to kill a few hours -- this is for you. Otherwise, keep fishing and cut Bait."

0,The press notes say the director spent five years developing Duets. He should have developed it more.
0,"To their credit, [Byrum and Paltrow] attempted to make a movie of ideas. Alas, many of the ideas are bad. Not to mention bigoted."
0,"Disjointed, contrived and about as plausible as a karaoke singer with a scholarship to Juilliard."

0,The movie simply creaks with contrivance.
0,"Looks a little like an early '70s TV-movie -- a lost, well-meaning artifact about 'looking for America' that you stumbled across during a late-night channel-surf."
0,"Watching Duets, you sense the small-screen calculations in John Byrum's script."
0,"The joys of singing give the movie a hook, but when Duets aims for lyricism, it's got a tin ear."
0,Marquee value of an Academy Award-winning star lifted it up to the big screen -- a step higher than it should have gone.
0,Duets will be most appreciated by music buffs. The actual karaoke scenes attain the bounce that's missing from the rest of the film.
0,"In addition to its other shortcomings, Duets is awfully slow in getting going."
0,"The talented cast doesn't stand much of a chance in this rambling, pointless narrative, reeling off such howlers as: 'I've waited all my life to spend time with you.'"
1,"It sometimes sings off-key, but at least it sings proud."
0,A conceptual train wreck.
1,"OK, it got to me."
0,Duets is a clumsily constructed motion picture that could have been a lot better with a tighter and more focused script.
0,Substitute 'bland' for 'blonde' and you've got a pretty good description of [Paltrow's] movie.
0,"Aside from Duets seeming ridiculously dated, it is seriously tone-deaf. It veers wildly from light pop to social protest to the kind of violent drama that could be played out to a rap track."
0,"Its fundamental error is that it tries to squeeze bittersweet heartbreak and goofy social satire into the same story. Just when the movie gets the rhythm, it steps on its own feet."
1,"Happily for all, director Bruce Paltrow approaches the sing-along world of karaoke with an affectionate but mildly satiric eye."
0,Every so often a movie comes along that's bad in such original and unexpected ways that it inspires an almost admiring fascination.

0,"This movie wants to have it both ways: to score points against beauty pageants and the cult of feminine beauty in our culture, but also to root for Mona. It doesn't work."
1,Focuses on one woman's heartfelt and funny journey in search of what beauty really means.
0,"The tame, confused script eventually sinks the film."
0,"Sally, get it straight: Mona doesn't deserve to be cheered. We don't like her. We really, really don't like her."
1,"In a feature directorial debut that never feels like one, Field is as effortless behind a camera as she is in front of one."
0,"There's so much wrong with Beautiful, we'd have to dedicate an entire section of the newspaper to charting its flaws."
0,"A conceptual tug-of-war between pathos, cynicism, and satire that is perfunctorily resolved by a thoroughly undeserved (if unsurprising) change of heart."

0,Certainly the beauty biz deserves better than the antsy and dispiriting Beautiful.
0,"A mess of a movie that suffers from awkward writing, a plot with major disconnects in plausibility, an annoyingly screechy kid character and cheesy production values."
0,"A movie with so many inconsistencies, improbabilities, unanswered questions and unfinished characters that we have to suspend not only disbelief but also intelligence."
0,"Some will argue that this review is cruel, and they may be right -- but so is being losing two hours of one's life to this inexcusably bad tripe."
0,As predictable as a beauty queen's tearful acceptance speech.
0,"It manages to find an almost pitch-perfect accumulation of ill-matched tones, sheer grotesquerie, near-heroic absurdity and self-canceling folly."

0,"Moves along with virtually no rhythm, no suspense, and no spark from the morose, goateed star."
0,Isn't likely to satisfy either action buffs or the actor's fans.
1,"Stylishly directed by Stephen Kay, the new Carter isn't half as bad as it could have been."
0,The flash cannot make up for the dullness of the script ... and Stallone's emotional immobility.
0,"David McKenna's script is a frayed string and a contextual nightmare, peppered with puzzling references to the first film in a lame attempt at homage."
0,"The stylish murk seems to signal that everyone on the technical crew had his own agenda, each trying to outdo the others."
0,"Stallone's Jack Carter can't shut up -- and his sentimental ramblings, accompanied by facial twitches that are apparently meant to approximate acting, are stupefying."
0,Director Stephen Kay obviously spent an inordinate amount of time studying The Limey ... but he learned all the wrong lessons.

0,How does a numbing mishmash of a movie like this get made?
0,"However neatly packaged, The Contender is double-dealing baloney."
0,Inane and dishonest.
0,"The film's very premise, while initially promising, doesn't hold up to lengthy scrutiny."
0,"Bury itself under a steaming heap of plot contrivance, equivocation and preachiness."
0,Cheesy.
0,"Wonderfully cast and slickly directed, but so crudely written as to make its espousing of progressive principles seem crassly exploitative to the point of self-parody."
0,"The film looks horrendous, poorly composed and staged, and the rhythm staggers."
0,"No question, The Contender taps into the modern political zeitgeist. As drama, however, it flails."
0,You don't have to be a conservative to feel pushed around by Lurie. All you have to be is a moviegoer who wants a little room to think for him- or herself.
1,
1,"The film's lively twists are not too difficult to see coming down the road, but the proceedings still hold our attention and keep us wanting to know how it's going to turn out."
1,"The Contender booms and pontificates, full of bravado and that ineffable quality of the current political season, chutzpah."
1,A major step forward for the director.
1,"This is one of those rare movies where you leave the theater having been surprised and entertained, and then start arguing."
1,An entertaining ringside seat for backroom wannabes and beltway junkies.
1,"While you're watching it, The Contender lives up to its title."
1,"The large, talented cast elevates the film above the trappings of its loquacious debates."
1,Intelligent.
1,"Smart, enjoyable."
1,The hit Primary Colors never was.
1,Streetsmart and savvy.
1,An intelligent and informed look at the preposterous ways our leaders are often picked and sabotaged.
1,Thoroughly engrossing.
1,Excellent performances in an entertaining if less than totally plausible story.
1,"What it lacks in credibility, it more than makes up for in energy and scandalous wit."
1,"What The Contender lacks in sophistication and subtlety, it more than makes up for with sheer verve and chutzpah."
1,A landslide winner as an emotionally rewarding drama.
1,"What makes this twisty, cautionary yarn ... delicious is a cast that chews the scenery with such obvious enjoyment."

1,"The movie has plenty going for it: a terrific cast led by Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman, a captivating story line, a sharp script. Most important, The Contender has timing."
0,"Only ... fans of Meadows' anachronistic Ladies Man caricature are likely to have any interest in this slapped-together, unfunny movie."
0,"As the plot points arrive, they're all stretched to the max. Even the film's most unexpected bit ... goes on and on and on."
0,80 minutes of comic mistiming and missed opportunities.
0,"Though he's worth a chuckle in a sketch, neither Leon nor Meadows is interesting enough to build a movie around."
0,"The Ladies Man joins the crop of terrible movies based on Saturday Night Live skits, and offers serious competition for a title as the worst."
0,"Another cheesy, overdrawn and witless Saturday Night Live takeoff."
0,"One more case of a winning SNL character tamed by the wan, fizzled farce around him."
1,It's a guilty pleasure -- but save it for a bargain matinee.
0,Desperately unfunny.
0,Grows more tedious the longer it's on the screen.
0,"Pointless, sporadically funny exercise."
1,"For what it is, a 90-minute spinoff of a Saturday Night Live sketch, Reginald Hudlin's film The Ladies Man is not bad."
1,A reasonably pleasant ramble.
0,The movie overstays its welcome merely by a factor of approximately eight.
0,
0,A dumb movie.
0,A waste of space.
0,Arguably the limpest film yet spun out from a Saturday Night Live sketch.
0,The results are disconcertingly bland under Reginald Hudlin's direction.
1,A cheap and forgettable romp which is unlikely to trouble filmgoers for long before finding a more suitable home down your local video store.
0,"When Meadows's three-minute sketch persona is stretched out to cover a whole movie, the cracks soon start to show."
0,"After I swallowed my disbelief and gave my critical faculties a break, yeah, I was tickled every 40 minutes or so."
0,"Yet another mostly unscary, occasionally comical Exorcist knockoff."
0,Kaminski and Gardner spend so much time dealing with Good and Evil that they seem to forget all about the far more important distinction between Good and Lousy.
0,"This muddled, shamelessly derivative mess should have been ticketed straight to video."
0,There are some inadvertently hilarious occurrences and some abominable acting.
0,"For a thriller about demonic possession and the birth of the antichrist, it's curiously flat."
0,Its characters are so colorless and uninvolving that it's hard to take them seriously.
0,"Yet another story about the devil taking over the world, the film starts out strongly, but quickly loses its way in the morass of its own hocus-pocus."
0,Feels like a film student's awkward homage to Polanski's Rosemary's Baby.
0,"The barely relieved boredom is, apparently, an attempt to contradict David Byrne's contention that only 'Heaven is a place where nothing really happens.'"
0,"On those occasions when the movie makes sense, the implications are often so idiotic that we wish it didn't."
0,"While it's beautifully shot, it's way too slow. And it isn't one bit scary."
0,"Far from being frightening or brutal or harrowing, as an exorcism thriller ought to be, it's silly, undone by lack of faith in its own subject."
0,"Muddled, relentlessly derivative and uninvolving except as a visually superb image roll."
0,This generically promotable but heavy-handed pic should look forward to a quick and relatively painless transition to the video shelf.
0,"Confusing, flatlined script."
0,A pretty dreary affair to sit through. It's not even scary.
0,"Kaminski brings all the visual oomph one could ask for, but not enough narrative spine, momentum, or substance."
0,"Despite its spooky, color-desaturated visuals, guffaws, not screams, are more in order."
0,The movie concludes with what may be the most anti-climactic Antichrist showdown in the history of devil dramas.
0,Lost Souls doesn't even give us a good exorcism.
0,This tale of ultimate evil is a maddeningly inert drama.
0,"Odd camera angles, artfully dim lighting and showy tracking shots simply don't make up for suspense or intelligence."
0,Sets a new standard for woebegone vacuousness in the millennial thriller subgenre.
0,Lucifer has been poorly served by Hollywood's current penchant for Satanic shenanigans.
0,"With the original Exorcist back at the multiplex, you don't need this pale copy."
0,[An] unholy mess of a flick.
0,The tedious storytelling sucks the life and soul out of the characters far more effectively than Satan ever manages.
0,"Alas, look is everything here and storytelling and characters are next to nothing, so what emerges is oddly ineffectual and uninvolving -- visually striking set pieces set loose in a void."
0,
1,"Well-plotted, with a first-class group of actors and sure-handed direction by Steven Spielberg's favorite cinema-tographer, Janusz Kaminski."
1,"Delivers laughs at a rather more than intermittent rate, and Elizabeth Hurley is a fun devil."
1,A cute and clever good-vs-evil parable that ought to appeal to those weary of SNL retreads and gross-out humor.
1,Outrageous fun.
0,So over the top you'll either enjoy it or be bothered and bewildered by it.
1,"More than funny. And despite the subtle accents of brimstone and sulphur, a breath of fresh air."
0,Most of these sketches devolve -- with apologies to the esteemed Mr. Darwin -- into schoolyard sniggering as fast as drool runs down a chin.

0,"A little more script work, at the very least, should have gone into the manufacture of the black comedy Bedazzled."
0,"A comedy that is weak even by today's humble standards, and pitiful when measured against the Cook-Moore version."
1,[Hurley and Fraser] make this film a whole lot better than it should have been.
0,"By the end of the movie, I wasn't so much bedazzled as bedraggled."
1,"Much of the writing is genuinely clever, and the really big laughs are ignited with crowd-pleasing frequency."
1,"A lively, generally amusing remake."
1,It's involving -- as an OK date movie -- primarily because of a tour de force as Elliot's multiple selves by Brendan Fraser.
0,"Watchable as she may be, Hurley is not the Devil for this movie."
0,It is lacking in wickedness. It doesn't smack its lips when it's naughty.
0,"Funny as Fraser is, he can't eliminate those extraneous stunts and special effects, he can't turn a series of scenes into a coherent whole, and he can't steer the film away from its sappy, programmatic ending."
1,"Fraser and Hurley are terrifically matched for their interplay, and some of the writing is so smart it outclasses the film's cartoonish feel and occasional foray into hokey special effects."
0,Flat and lame.
0,The new writing team has dumbed-down the script to such an extent that the jokes sound like rejects from a Farrelly brothers comedy.
0,"Not only is this film persistently unfunny, but it is consistently uninvolving."
1,"I think retooling Bedazzled relies most significantly on getting just the right devil, and you couldn't come up with a more perfect Luciferess than Elizabeth Hurley."
0,The lavish scenes and gaudy effects can't compensate for the lack of genuine wit.
1,"Brendan Fraser is one funny, mixed-up guy. And as Ms. Lucifer, the new scourge of Fraser's life, Elizabeth Hurley crackles with sexy sarcasm."
1,A positively divine comedy.
0,"There's no real dazzle in Bedazzled, though you may be befuddled trying to figure out why anyone was compelled to make the effort."
1,It offers a diverting couple of hours at the movies.

1,It's fun.
0,Apparently [the town inhabitants] haven't heard of the healing properties of chocolate or male stripping.
0,More interaction involving the hairdressers and the townspeople - along with the deletion of one or two meaningless side plots - might have given Blow Dry more body.
0,"It may be possible that people who never go to the movies will stumble across Blow Dry and find it a charming way to spend an hour and a half, but the rest of us will have the ending written in our heads by the end of the first five minutes."
0,"It's not a good hair day for Blow Dry, in which The Full Monty writer Simon Beaufoy tries to mesh melodrama and camp, but comes up with merely a fraction of the inspiration of his previous international hit."
1,"If you can handle weepy smiles and lots of hairspray, then go."
1,"Few things can be counted on to lift a person's spirits better than a good haircut. If Blow Dry isn't quite so sure a bet, it probably comes close enough."
1,"If Blow Dry isn't a rousing triumph on the order of The Full Monty and Brassed Off, Rickman, Richardson and Nighy make sure it's a winning film."
1,You find yourself liking many of these people and even sort of rooting for the Cut Above team.
0,"Director Paddy Breathnach, who made the criminally underrated I Went Down, struggles to counteract the hackneyed plotting with visual grace. All the actors likewise struggle to rise above the mawkish sentimentality."
0,"The film comes off as little more than a contrived composite, despite the best efforts of pros Rickman, Richardson, and Griffiths."
0,"Despite its dollops of good-natured humor and sentiment, Blow Dry is likely to play better on the tube as a likable-enough diversion."
0,The problem is director Paddy Breathnach can't decide what kind of movie this should be.
1,It doesn't matter if you know or care nothing about hairstyling. You'll probably enjoy this movie more the less you care about hair.
0,High-spirited but erratic.
0,Another case of when bad scripts happen to good actors.
0,The script by Simon Beaufoy of The Full Monty fame is far more soapy than bubbly as it concentrates on extended family entanglements and allows its comic potential to be bleached out by a ponderous mawkish streak.
0,Blow Dry seems both overplotted and underimagined.
0,"Blow Dry is enjoyable in a low-key way, but it's far from an unqualified hit, and lacks the infectious energy of Beaufoy's earlier effort."
0,A tedious comedy.
0,"What Blow Dry needs, though, is less connect-the-dots and a little more of the waywardness that Warren Clarke's mayor-turned-emcee manages to wring from his limited assignment."

1,Wagner is perfect as the college kid psycho coolly removing the pregnant Woodward from his life.
1,"This multiple-murder story is an offbeat sort of film, with Robert Wagner portraying a calculating youth who intends to allow nothing to stand in his way to money... Gerd Oswald's restrained direction suits the mood."
0,"Feels like a compendium of any number of similarly themed coming-of-age films without the ability to mine any fresh, satisfying resonance in the assembly."
0,"[Malena is] Renato's -- and Tornatore's -- sex fantasy, never a flesh-and-blood woman."
0,It renders the story in such grandiose visual terms that style often seems to overpower the tale.
0,More cringesome than cute.
0,"An unlikable and foul farce, unworthy of Tornatore's previously gentle touch."
0,The balance between broad ribaldry and gritty tragedy is so off-kilter that you really don't care what life lessons Renato has learned in the end.
0,Too often seems like a slightly silly film about the dangers of being too beautiful.
0,[Bellucci's] role is not so much dramatic as pictorial (a word I am using in the Playboy sense).
1,There's something quirkily intriguing about an infatuation conducted mostly without words.
1,"Flushed with emotion and a buoyant earthy humor, Malna is a yarn that sticks with you."
1,"Relentlessly cleareyed instead of shamelessly manipulative, and it builds to an emotional crescendo that brings to mind the finales of the Neo-Realist classics."
1,Not for decades has Italian film offered a presence so sexy and mythic as Bellucci.
1,"A well-crafted, provocative film by one of Italy's consummate screen artists."
1,"Makes something wistful, enduring and even optimistic out of humanity's basest instincts."
1,Its heart is in the right place.
0,Transparently misogynist at its core.
1,An affecting coming-of-age story.
0,The result is like a bad novel in which the personalities and feelings of the characters are described to us rather than revealed through what they do.
1,"[Bellucci] has presence, maybe even talent, but you wish that Malena's inner life had been given as much accent as her outer charms."
1,Funny as it is sobering.
0,"The film lacks a focused, compelling narrative -- perhaps because Tornatore is trying to manufacture a hit by juggling story elements more forced and manipulative than felt."
0,"Like Malena herself, the movie ends up nothing more than a great-looking mess."
1,"Renato does not intervene to correct the false impressions of the townspeople, nor does he courageously stand for Malna ... What happens instead is far more compelling, but no less merciful and moving."
0,Any moral lesson the film pretends to hold is as muddled as it is misguided.
1,"The cliches in this movie are as ripe and plump and tightly packed as olives in a jar. But the surface is handsome, moving and humorous, and people are going to like it."
0,Bereft of the more richly textured sentiments of Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso.
1,[Tornatore] eludes sentimentality with a romantic vision wide enough to embrace the range of human experience.
0,"Despite Bellucci's strong presence in a role with little dialogue, the central character never really comes alive in any way interesting enough to give her ordeal much genuine pathos."
1,

1,It's got the pleasing proportions of a stocking stuffed with agreeable little treats in the absence of an exciting big surprise.
0,"The makers of The Gift lay on the rustic nonsense awfully thick, peopling the tiny town of Brixton, Ga., with more 'colorful' characters than any town -- or movie -- can tolerate."
1,"Raimi eschews trendy, over-emphatic effects in favor of a straightforward approach that makes for a solid tale well told."
0,"Characters lean too heavily toward the Southern grotesque, and the direction the plot is heading is more predictable than it should be."
1,"The scary-movie score and taut editing give the audience a lot of popcorn thrills, but the movie resonates at all because of the deeper, more moving concerns at its core."
1,A creepily effective button-pusher.
0,You can't escape the feeling that everyone involved deserved something better.
1,"An acceptably suspenseful, watchable Southern Gothic whodunit."
1,An example of how superior craftsmanship can transform a ho-hum genre entry into a sporadically gripping thriller.
1,"Within its limits, it has rock-solid craftsmanship and a dream cast that may be better than the material."
1,[Blanchett's] grounded intelligence and subtle craft holds the movie together even at its most overheated.
1,"There's really just one reason to see the Southern freak show that is Sam Raimi's The Gift, and fortunately it's the best reason: to watch the star of the piece."
1,"A glorious textbook example of a gifted film maker's ability to transform a familiar genre and, thrillingly, to confound our expectations in the process."
0,"Raimi's latest picture, The Gift, looks like an attempt to create a classier version of the kind of horror movie that established his reputation nearly two decades ago."
0,Uneven and conventional.
0,The movie has an impressive cast. Blanchett is a terrific actress who deserves better than this.
0,"Unfortunately, Raimi and Thornton -- who collaborated as director and star on the genuinely creepy A Simple Plan -- have only enough material this time to sustain half a movie."
1,"At its best The Gift evokes some of the creepy chills of To Kill a Mockingbird. And at its heart, there's Blanchett, an actress whose instincts are unerring, and dead-on."
1,A modest entertainment.
0,"Logic is mocked, plot strands capriciously abandoned. Actors chew upholstery, and the heroine has so many 'Don't open that door, lady!' moments that the movie starts to play like an unintended parody of overblown hokum."
1,"Raimi's skillful direction, the way he positions the camera, and his brilliant pacing keep things jumping almost until the final frame."
1,"A solidly crafted, suspensefully written, powerfully acted little juggernaut."
1,The smartest and scariest supernatural thriller since The Sixth Sense.
1,"Even if you've figured out where The Gift is headed, the actors keep you watching closely."
1,"The movie is ingenious in its plotting, colorful in its characters, taut in its direction and fortunate in possessing Cate Blanchett."
0,Originality is clearly not a strong point with this script.
0,"It's not wise to build a story around a psychic. If you don't believe in this stuff, the story simply will not work, ever, anyhow, any way, any time, any place."
0,A rather pedestrian whodunit.

1,A picture fascinating in both its complexity and absurdity.
1,Represents docudrama-style storytelling at a very high level.
1,"The narrative pallet of Traffic is rich, tightly woven, and consistently involving, with characters that are as well developed as their necessarily limited screen time allows."
1,Dazzling!
1,A cogent commentary on a major societal ill and a signal from Soderbergh that he's more than capable of handling the complexities of an ensemble drama.
1,"Occasionally naive, but often harrowing, always engaging."
1,Stephen Gaghan's script mines nearly 2 1/2 hours of consistently credible drama from four interlocked stories.
1,"Breathtakingly stylish, wonderfully acted and its three interrelated tales of the 'war' on drugs are brilliantly structured to form a cohesive, powerful whole."
1,Exemplary Hollywood social realism.
1,"The film understands the sheer, brutal force of human desire."
1,Yet another indication of how accomplished a filmmaker Steven Soderbergh has become.
0,Traffic is a failure of a very high order -- a movie that takes a gutsy stand and displays real filmmaking savvy but simply isn't as exciting as it should be to watch.
1,"A riveting, semi-documentary drama, and yet calling it that is a disservice to just how suspenseful and stylish an entertainment it is."
1,"Traffic is one story with many threads -- interwoven, snagging and opposing threads that all come together beautifully."
1,Traffic is movie excitement from beginning to end.
1,"As Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican policeman caught between overwhelming corruption and his granite-encased integrity, Del Toro's the best reason of all to watch the movie."
1,There's enough here to keep anyone in awe.
1,"It's a thriller that really thrills, a drama that really engages, a portrait of a world and system out of joint that is painfully convincing and totally engrossing from the first simmering minute to the last explosive second."
1,"Impressively vast canvas portrait of the futile war on drugs, though lacking anything new on the subject."
1,"In compelling terms, it puts bitter economic, social and racial truth before our eyes. Continue to blink or see. Your choice."
1,Don't avoid Traffic. It takes you to the most amazing places.
1,"Traffic sometimes has the impact of a tense war film or a grittily modernist, post- Godfather crime epic such as Heat or Goodfellas."
1,"Smart, risky entertainment."
1,"The movie's scope is breathtaking, delivering the most expansive portrait of the illegal narcotics trade ever put on film."
1,Walk straight and steady into Steven Soderbergh's dizzying drug drama Traffic and minutes later you'll feel as woozy as if you had fallen into one of Wonderland's smokiest sinkholes.
1,A huge canvas of a movie that nonetheless brings the various facets of drug trafficking -- and drug-taking -- down to human scale.
1,"With Traffic, his most ambitious and complex film to date, Soderbergh again proves himself one of our most inventive filmmakers."
1,"A blistering, thought-provoking modern masterpiece."
1,"Traffic looks like the Oscar best-picture front-runner, and so does Soderbergh, for best director. But long after everyone has forgotten who won the statues, it will be remembered as one of film's most stylish and electrifying wake-up calls."
1,The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach.
1,A triumph from all perspectives.
1,"A real cannonball, a hardass drama about the drug trade that Steven Soderbergh directs like a thriller -- it comes out blazing."
1,
0,It leaves one feeling restless and dissatisfied.
1,"A sprawling, artistic, superbly acted, informative, and mainstream Hollywood movie."
1,"Soderbergh's jazzed stylistics can be smartly entertaining. Without them, an uneven movie like Traffic might seem more of a m챕lange than it already is."
1,Director Steven Soderbergh is riding one of the hottest streaks in the movie world.
1,"It's wise about different kinds of addiction and concepts of family, about the folly, futility and hypocrisy of anti-drug 'wars', and about the awful human cost of it all. And it grips like a vice from start to end."
1,"The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled."
0,"I don't see this slightly better-than-average drug thriller, with slightly better-than-average direction by Steven Soderbergh, as anything more than a routine rubber-stamping of genre reflexes."
0,"The first hour of the story, whose rampant unexplained mysteries will leave you scratching your head in wonderment."
0,"Slick, self-assured, and thoroughly awful, Double Take is a primo contender for worst movie of 2001."
0,Botched on every count.
0,The kind of movie you'll encounter in the wasteland of late-night cable -- and watch with a measure of awe.
0,"Another racial cartoon buddy movie that eagerly flogs its best laugh -- indeed, its only laugh -- in the trailer."
0,Let's hope that next time Jones chooses a movie that's worth a second look.
0,"If Big Momma's House made you belly-laugh, Double Take won't. If Scary Movie gave you convulsions, Double Take won't. If The Nutty Professor left you delirious, Double Take ... heck, you know the drill."
0,"It's too violent, too muddled and too pat to be much more than an average evening's entertainment on UPN."
0,Piling double-cross upon deception at a speed that quickly outpaces the audience's interest in what's happening.
1,Wickedly funny.
0,The movie has more product placements than halftime at the Super Bowl.
0,"Throw two very different people together. Then put them on the run, shot at by both police and bad guys. The recipe has produced some funny movies. Double Take isn't one of them."
1,Frequently funnier than it has any right to be.
1,"Once past the insanity, the movie achieves a strange sort of brilliance."
0,A mess of half-baked gags in an uneasy mix of buddy film and on-the-road adventure.
1,"Gallo has delivered a clever suspense comedy that, thanks to a taut script, creative direction, and first-rate performances from its leads."
0,The legendary British novelist is probably turning over in his grave at being associated with this witless farrago.
0,"If you doze or play your GameBoy for an hour or so in the middle of the movie, you might find it an agreeable time-waster."
0,Double Take is the kind of double-triple-reverse movie that can drive you nuts because you can't count on anything in the plot.
0,A shell game passing as entertainment.
0,"As if to compensate for this lack of focus, all the spats are enacted at maximum volume, pitched so high that we often don't know how to take them."
0,
1,This is a film that's better than it has any right to be.
0,
0,"Double Take is so convoluted, so unnecessarily mind-boggling, it should be called Quintuple Take."
1,"The Pledge will cause many viewers to walk out of the theaters grumbling, since there is no traditional closure. But the way in which things turn out seems right for the material and the manner in which Penn has chosen to present it."
1,"Though at times it threatens to meander off, Penn's movie fulfills its destiny as an alienated fable of justice and luck."
1,Jack Nicholson more than delivers the goods in his portrayal of a retired policeman thoroughly obsessed by his last murder case.
1,Absorbing dramatically and deeply committed to the acting processes of star Jack Nicholson and the raft of impressive players supporting him.
1,It understands the relativism of right and wrong and takes a kind of perverse pleasure in reminding us that there are some things we'll never know.
1,"Jack Nicholson passes on the ham, delivering a subtle, weighted performance that neatly complements Sean Penn's growing confidence as a director."
0,"Penn's unending parade of unhappy situations is simply too insistent, his suffocating, claustrophobic worldview more of an assault than the revelation he perhaps hopes it will be."
1,Much of the film's power is in the worn gravity of watching 'Jack Nicholson' as he treads through a particularly obsessive and difficult character.
1,"Yes, it's grim, but if you don't need your plots sugar-coated, this film about life-change, obsession and keeping your word is an existential winner."
1,Damned if Penn doesn't draw you inside this labyrinth of existential murk.
1,"Thanks to a superb central performance by Nicholson as detective Black, it's a film that compels, thrills and ends up coming very close to tragedy."
0,"Drags us through dark places, without convincing us it's a journey worth taking."
1,A movie of impressive performances and intriguing visuals that are worth the effort needed to let the tale roll out.
1,It's the rare -- and rewarding -- police drama that cares more for character than plot.
1,A moving and unmannered motion picture -- a convincing portrait of a man at the end of his rope.
1,"Penn as director shows how he can turn an ordinary movie scene -- how many times have we seen a jailhouse interrogation? -- into something inventively, thrillingly singular."
1,Those looking for a 'feel-good' movie are advised to go elsewhere -- unless watching artists working near their peak leaves you soaring.
1,"The performance, and the movie, remind us why Nicholson matters."
1,[A] beautifully made bummer.
1,"A gripping, disturbing and deeply intelligent drama."
1,It is understatement to say that Nicholson does some of the finest work of his career here.
1,I'll wager you won't see a better performance by a veteran American actor over the next 11 months.
1,Dark and disturbing but thoroughly involving. It sets off depth charges of the psyche.
0,"It has all the right credentials, so why is it such a muddled mess?"
1,"Just when you're about to lose patience, something honest or credible happens."
1,"In its dark, relentless, devastatingly ironic way, The Pledge is an exhilarating movie, partly because it isn't afraid to be genuinely challenging."
1,"Not a film for all tastes, but it's a considerable artistic achievement."
1,"Penn and Nicholson take risks with the material and elevate the movie to another, unanticipated, haunting level."
1,"Not a pleasant film, but it is deeply, scarily rewarding."
0,"Penn's direction is given to flat, self-conscious realism. He has no feel for pacing, no cunning, no natural flow."
1,"A fierce, fragmented, downbeat film."
1,
0,"As enthralling as it sometimes is, there isn't any point to the relentless grimness."
0,"Ultimately, the payoffs just aren't there, either psychologically or dramatically."
1,"Penn can't be faulted for his work with the actors. Most of the featured players have only a scene or two, but they're indelible."
1,"Mystery-thriller buffs, promise yourselves that you'll see The Pledge. And while you're at it, be sure to invite along Jack Nicholson fans and anyone who saw the first two movies that Sean Penn directed."
1,"Mr. Bromell's shrewdness in constructing narrative is a bit more advanced than his directing skills, but he has worked out Panic intelligently and supported his script with an able cast."
1,There has never been an evocation of middle-aged disappointment like it.
1,There's a sense that the picture wants to constantly stick its tongue in its cheek but never wants to get caught at it.
0,"Once you've seen the first hour, there's really no need to sit through the rest, since almost everything that transpires during the final thirty minutes is easily predicted by anyone who understands the conventional storyline handbook."
1,The movie equivalent of a great read at the beach.
1,A first film made with joy and with a writer's gift for character and dialogue.
1,Panic offers a more naturalistic analysis of male midlife crisis than the grotesquely overpraised American Beauty.
1,A terrific little time bomb of a film.
1,A black-comedy gem.
1,A defiantly offbeat and accomplished piece with a dream ensemble acting out one man's nightmare.
1,"Both subtle and formidably odd, and already you can feel an enthusiastic cult following forming."
1,There's so much that's fresh and surprising about the film that it deserves to be seen.
1,The results are quietly electrifying.
1,"Stylish and assured, but it's finally too studied to get the kind of emotional heft it's looking for from its effects."
1,"Radiates quiet and calm, while simmering with tension both comic and tragic."
1,It's less the plot than the texture that makes the film such an engaging surprise.
1,Bromell ... is adept at piercing the heart of dysfunctional family ties.
1,A gently subversive outing full of nicely limned characters.
1,Corrosive and haunting.
1,"Ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling."
0,"An indifferently plotted, often banal police procedural that would never win a sizable audience without its pedigree."
1,Riveting suspense spiced with diabolical laughs and garnished with a sprig of kinky romance add up to the tastiest dish around.
0,"Not nearly as sardonic as it means to be, Hannibal seems inanely pleased with itself."
0,"Hannibal isn't a terrible movie, but it is a disappointment, and more than a small step down from the level of its predecessor."
0,Hannibal is Godfather III-level slumming.
0,A disappointment.
1,Handsomely photographed.
0,"More complicated, more outrageous, less controlled in every way."
1,Ridley Scott ... casts a grisly fairy tale spell.
0,Too half-baked for even a guy like Lecter to swallow.
1,Not 'as good' as its predecessor. But the general public will find it more entertaining.
0,"If it hadn't been the sequel to one of the best films of its kind, Hannibal probably wouldn't rate a blue-plate special for America's cinematic appetite."
1,Both spectacular and disappointing.
1,"Anthony Hopkins returns in silken, menacing form in the role that earned him an Oscar."
1,"Hopkins, who is electrifying in almost anything he does, reprises the mastery he brought to Silence of the Lambs. Even in a movie as patchworky as this, he's always compelling."
1,"It is not bad on its own terms, and it is certainly engrossing, but it comes nowhere near the power and sordid glory of the original."
0,Hannibal won't even be a footnote when the year's best movies are grabbing the ink in December.
0,Bears many of the wounds of the book's confusion.
1,"Isn't in the same class as the original, but as sequels go, it's no Porky's 2, either."
0,"There are disgusting movies that are worth seeing -- Silence of the Lambs, for one -- and others that are merely disgusting. Then there's Hannibal, which exists in its own category."
0,Very likely the worst film of this year and quite possibly the next.
0,"Meandering, emotionally empty and thoroughly unsavory, it's not so much shocking as shockingly bad."
1,"Not as good as you hoped, better than you feared."
1,Silly though handsomely staged.
0,"Of the three films made from Thomas Harris' novels featuring the murderous psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is the least compelling or frightening."
0,"If you regard Hannibal as a sequel to The Silence Of The Lambs, the only possible result is disappointment."
0,Unsatisfying.
0,It fails to create the deeply threatening vacuum that is the original's claim to enduring fame and resonance.
0,The underlying story lacks the fascination of Silence of the Lambs.
0,"Not only disgraces its predecessor, it abuses its audience -- first by boring it brainless, then by feeding it gore and calling it gourmet."
0,"A full-bore freak show, with the emphasis on bore."
1,Hannibal is weak kin to its Oscar-winning forebear.
1,"It's best to just enjoy Hannibal for what it is: A decadent, elegant waltz about evil's seductive bloom."
1,A good movie of its type.
0,Simply a fat slab of sadism.
1,Well-sustained tension throughout.
0,"Hannibal definitely grabs at the emotions, but not the one it's after. You come in hoping to have the wits scared out of you and leave with your temper barely in check."
0,"Hannibal Lecter is the ostensible cannibal of this franchise, but the real cannibals are his creators. I wouldn't be surprised if the next time, they have him endorsing his favorite Chianti."
1,The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance.
1,"The story line of Hannibal is far less interesting than Silence of the Lambs and lacks the emotional subtlety of its predecessor. However, Hannibal is visually and aurally sumptuous, powered by Hans Zimmer's lovely score and brimming with flashy imagery."
0,"No tension, no rhythm and no sense of purpose ... unless you count helping ""Faces of Death"" fans feel more evolved."
0,"Hannibal doesn't seem to be about anything but its own swank decadence. Hopkins, with his reedy voice and effete airs, is still quite delicious in the part that won him an Oscar. But 10 years later, Lecter has become more camp than terrifying."
0,"Neither remotely romantic nor funny, but as a movie about a dead man, it is decidedly lacking life."
0,"Despite an energetic effort by the star, it's not a case of third time lucky."
1,"Often uproariously funny, blessedly short and never forgets it's a screwball romance for teen and adult moviegoers."
0,Astonishingly unfunny.
0,Rock rocks. His movie doesn't.
0,A ham-handed fantasy that manages the damn near impossible feat of making Chris Rock unfunny.
0,"For a comedy, there are precious few real laughs."
1,"It's pretty consistently funny, if far generations removed from anything original."
0,Affable but forgettable.
0,Bland and unfunny.
0,"The movie is still mostly just a weak rehash of its already-light predecessors, and what humor there is mostly comes off as just plain, ah, stiff."
0,Heaven can wait and so can the audience for the new Chris Rock comedy ever to catch fire.
1,"Doesn't feel fat or padded, like so many contemporary comedies, and its very leanness is appealing."
1,"At its best, Down to Earth is pleasant, relatively inoffensive vehicle for Rock, who, at least, proves that he can 'carry' a movie. But next time, please, no remakes."
0,This medium-octane farce is neither as uproarious as its star and set-up promise nor as inept as every other studio picture released in recent weeks.
1,Mildly amusing.
0,"Unfortunately, a lot of the potential for humor is wasted because the movie audience can't see what the people around Lance magically see."
0,A feeble effort that feels interminable even at a lean 86 minutes.
0,"As funny as he is on a concert stage, and as smart as his humor sometimes was on his recently ended HBO show, the man can't act."
0,"By midpoint in the movie, you feel somewhat left out of the central joke. You feel as if the characters are in on the fun of the payoff, but not the audience."
0,"Down to Earth feels like a movie placed in a cage by studio suits, the better for draining all daring and creativity."
0,"Chris Rock is funny and talented, and so I have said several times... This project must have looked promising, since the directors are brothers Chris and Paul Weitz, fresh from American Pie. But the movie is dead in the water."
0,"Down to Earth is a little too shipshape, too eager to please, not quite as anarchic as the best comedies."
0,A pretty sloppy comedy with a very light sprinkling of laughs or even chuckles.
0,"Rock can't really be expected to pull off the love scenes, but for a man trying to reach the largest possible audience, his comedy is surprisingly uninspired."
0,Offers a strangely muted and largely unfunny Rock.
1,Almost every minute of Down to Earth is entertaining. But not quite surprising.
1,"When Rock finds his authentic swing as an actor as well as a comedian, he'll be, like, a movie god."
0,The makers of Down to Earth were faced with a dilemma nobody would have anticipated: Boosting their star's screen time kills the comedy.
1,
0,
0,Mr. Rock's opening scene is very funny. After that it's a steep downhill slide.
1,The basic validity of the story's emotional core beneath all the contrivance starts carrying the day in the latter stretches.
0,What keeps it (barely) from being completely intolerable is Keanu Reeves' hilariously awful lead performance.
0,Not going to find much surprising or fresh.
0,"Charlize Theron has charm and skill, but no actress could survive this role, which has the gravity and verisimilitude of a sketch from a late-sixties Nancy Sinatra TV special."
0,"A man who doesn't ask why the woman whose bed he shares disappears for long locked door sessions in the bathroom is a man in need of his own subscription to O, the Oprah Magazine."
0,The film is ultimately undermined by its fondness for sudser clichs.
1,"A passable, soggy valentine."
0,"With a convoluted, contrived plot that effectively emasculates and lobotomizes the lead characters, Sweet November fails to connect on an emotional level."
0,"Beware all male viewers who enter here, you are in chick-movie hell."
0,It nearly qualifies as a guilty pleasure. But blame Keanu Reeves for ruining its chances for so- bad- it's- good status.
0,"To quote Reeves when Theron tries to bolt suddenly from his car: 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!'"
1,"Sweet November is neither a masterpiece nor a remake of one, but its wistfulness is infectious, and its melancholy mood lingers for days."
1,"Sweet November does neither of its leads any favors. But they fill their roles admirably, and then some."
0,"As Bill and Ted might say, it's one bogus journey, dude."
0,Dumb enough to make The Wedding Planner seem like an Ingmar Bergman film.
0,Defies all comprehension.
0,The sort of movie that seems to exist for no good reason except to keep the studio's pipeline filled with filmed product.
0,This is a film that means to be seductive but merely progresses from the contrived to the manipulative.
0,"If the women's movement meant anything, it should mean no more movies like this one."
1,A guilty pleasure for more than a few ticket buyers who rarely get a chance to indulge their weakness for this sort of story.
0,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that reminds you how wonderful life can be. Unfortunately, Sweet November does this by reminding you how terrible a movie can be."
0,"In his 1922 poem 'The Waste Land,' T.S. Eliot said 'April is the cruelest month.' He never saw Sweet November."
0,"I don't know who I disliked more intensely -- Nelson, the abrupt, insulting ad man played by Keanu Reeves, or Sara, Charlize Theron's narcissistic martyr."
1,It allows [Theron] to extend her range as no previous role has done.
0,"I kept waiting for [Reeves] to point out that, given the state of San Francisco real estate these days, it's hard to reconcile a life of endless surf-romping with a life of having a roof over one's head."
0,Should have been called Cloying November.
0,"Who on earth could resist Charlize Theron? Well, if she's imitating Sandy Dennis, it's not all that hard."
0,"If Sweet November were a valentine, it would end up in the dead-letter office."
0,There's just too much fantasy here to swallow or take seriously.
0,O'Connor shamelessly lays on the schmaltz and cliches.
0,Extra-thick vanilla schmalted with just the right amount of raw sugar to summon the awwwws of high school girls.
0,
0,
0,"Reeves gets the cloddishness right. In a regression from his good performance in The Gift, he keeps waving his arms like a cop directing traffic."
0,"Any movie in which a dying person dons a rainbow-colored fright wig is in serious trouble. But if it also stars Keanu Reeves, well, welcome to the 10-worst list."
1,
0,Stuffed with the most obvious points imaginable.
0,A shallow comedy with few insights and only sporadic laughs.
1,Hardwick's boisterous film is enjoyably slapstick and uses laughter rather than psychological insights as therapy.
0,The egomaniacal thrust behind The Brothers is the same drive that's fueled dozens of other low-watt bar-talk flicks.
1,"Digs more vibrantly into issues of trust, fear, pleasure, commitment, and camaraderie than any Hollywood feature in recent memory."
1,"The dialogue is witty and lively, and the characters are crafted with insight and care."
1,Hughley and Jones have an explosively comic chemistry together.
0,"If you want to take down Waiting to Exhale, you'd better have a stronger grip on men and women and how they connect or fail to connect than this."
0,It's regurgitating pop psychology ideas that are unlikely to be surprising to anyone sitting in the audience.
1,"Glossy fun, but it should have given us more ideas and energy."
1,"Often funny, often wise and often raunchy."
1,"A lively, affectionate and well-acted romantic comedy."
1,A politically incorrect but often hilarious jam session.
0,Airless and oddly fatiguing.
1,It's easier to laugh with the movie than take it seriously.
1,"Like candy, this male answer to the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale is sweet, pleasing and goes down easy -- but it's not very filling. Still, it's tasty while it lasts."
1,"If The Brothers falls far short of its prototype, Waiting to Exhale, it still conveys a warm-blooded affection for its characters."
0,The Brothers is basically a Lifetime movie that somehow found its way into theaters.
1,"For all its coarse humor, The Brothers has moments of tenderness and depth."
1,"Smart, earthy and, in its own way, tender, The Brothers packs a powerfully entertaining punch."
0,"For romantic comedy, it is not particularly romantic or funny."
1,"It's undeniable that director-writer Gary Hardwick's The Brothers has a target demographic. But the movie's themes of family, love and friendship are universal."
1,"The movie's a mixed bag, but worth seeing for the good stuff, which is a lesson in how productive it can be to allow characters to say what they might actually say."
1,The Brothers is carried by the warmth that both sexes pour into its sitcom soul.
1,
0,
0,A picture to be watched for its plot mechanics and very occasional laughs rather than with any engagement in its characters or the stakes involved.
1,"The actors appear to be having a ball playing these ridiculous caricatures, and somehow the sheer obviousness of the bits provokes laughs."
0,"Unwieldy, dumb, rarely funny (and never truly hilarious) and largely charmless."
0,"Trust me, you'll want to leave these people to get on with their tedious scams alone."
0,Oafishly staged by zoom-addled David Mirkin.
1,"I'm thrilled to report that Sigourney holds her own. Lord, does that woman work it."
1,"Even when director David Mirkin strains for laughs, the actors (a special cheer to Liotta) prove themselves expert farceurs."
1,Weaver is an enormously resourceful comedian and hasn't had so much fun since Ghostbusters and Working Girl.
0,Fatally bogged down by a ridiculous caring parent scenario.
0,"At best, a half hearted mercenary farce."
0,"It's too long and overplayed, and only sporadically funny."
0,The script is lacking that 'a-ha' moment so vital to con-artist comedies.
0,You'd practically have to be a laugh track to enjoy it.
0,Hewitt actually sucks life and laughs from just about every scene.
0,"An expensive imitation of older, better films from older, often better times."
1,You stick with it because Weaver and her co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt are so appealing.
1,Great escapist fun.
0,"Director David Mirkin, whose Romy and Michele's High School Reunion was similarly afflicted, never gets the timing right and allows the story to drag with little internal logic."
1,Heartbreakers is one of these guilty pleasures.
0,"Unless you're a Hackman aficionado, there's no reason to bother with Heartbreakers."
1,Hits just the right note between naughty and raunchy.
0,There are not enough Hefty bags in all The Home Depots to contain the trash generated by this vulgar burlesque.
1,"Naughty is an outdated word in an era of proud nastiness, but Heartbreakers has a slinky, teasing quality that recalls the dressed-up comedies of the studio era."
0,"Despite its talented and/or attractive cast, Heartbreakers is an ugly movie: The kind that makes you feel slightly soiled afterwards, not to mention conned out the price of admission as efficiently as the victims of the movie's two heroines."
0,"The film unfolds in an impersonal, by-the-book fashion that threatens to become downright laborious."
0,"In the end, Heartbreakers doesn't actually have a heart."
0,"At just over two hours, Heartbreakers stretches its premise and easygoing silliness to the maximum."
1,Laugh out loud? You bet.
0,"It ignores one of the game's unbreakable rules: Do the job and get out quick. Instead, Heartbreakers spends more than 2 hours meandering its way through the story."
1,A concoction by director David Mirkin that never fails to sink to the lowest common denominator -- yet often hits a funny bone.
0,A two-hour marathon.
1,"It's not a great comedy, but it's a raucous one, hard-working and ribald, and I like its spirit."
0,"Too lumpish, languid, and lukewarm to hit even the guilty pleasure zone."
1,"Manages to pull an engaging and funny popcorn movie out of a mediocre script, slack pace, and lacklustre direction thanks to the considerable talents of its cast."
0,
1,An appealingly quirky love story.
0,The filmmakers seem to be feeling their way toward a contemporary slant on romance but wind up taking refuge in old-fashioned cliches and trite plot twists.
0,A particularly shallow dissection of single-woman blues.
0,"Someone Like You could probably be charitably characterized as 'cute,' but there's such a lack of direction and energy that it could also be described as 'sleep inducing.'"
0,Forgettable affair.
0,Someone Like You hammers so hard at its cutesy premise of animal-mating-ritual theories that it fairly numbs you.
1,"This may be a 'chick flick' or, I suppose, a 'cow flick.' But I'd like to know what 'bull' can resist that."
0,There's nothing else about Someone Like You to separate it from the herd.
0,"An oddly flat, quirky romantic comedy."
0,Isn't exactly a great date movie unless you like to argue afterward.
1,Boring and safe.
0,The very definition of innocuous.
0,"It seemed over-slick, artificial, unpleasantly self-congratulatory -- a pseudo-Nora Ephron yarn set in the SoHo-Greenwich Village area. More damagingly, it's not very funny."
1,Definitely likeable.
0,A little lifeless.
0,"Ashley Judd tries to make Jane interesting, but seems to be longing for some decent situations and dialogue -- and no bull."
0,A romantic comedy with insights into sex and relationships that are old and obvious.
1,Refreshingly funny.
0,"All over the place, and seems to have been made by embittered married people."
0,"Elizabeth Chandler's script has, by my count, exactly one sort-of-funny line and not a single scene whose comic possibilities are successfully exploited."
0,"Bland, predictable, sitcom-esque."
1,"Smart, amiable and well-paced."
0,Uncommonly flat and uninteresting.
1,The smartest cinematic take on he/she in memory.
0,"Stars Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman and director Tony Goldwyn are probably all hoping that with a title so blandly nondescriptive, no one will see it, and promising careers will be left unblemished."
0,"The film, whose forgettable title is a good indication of its originality, is little more than a collection of Judd's excessive facial expressions and body movements."
1,"An enjoyable pastry of a film that, for the first time in years, shows off Judd's considerable talents to full effect."
0,A pretty lame premise.
0,"Like cinematic Olestra, it'll slide right through your brain leaving no impression."
0,It's about the most predictable -- and least original -- film you'll see for weeks.
0,
0,"It's neither clever nor that funny, the starry cast is underused, and the potential for a much wittier script never fulfilled."
0,Inevitability of the plotting and lack of modulated rhythm make the 97-minute running time feel longer than it is.
1,"Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen."
1,"Intelligent, well-acted, all-American version of the Shakespeare tragedy."
0,"Scott's Hamlet has been staged with clarity and competency... But the video-library shelves are already overflowing with more vital adaptations, so there's no real reason to blow the dust off this one."
1,Campbell Scott's self-helmed Great Dane is more than ever a man for our time... the veteran thesp - who returns to the role after several legit runs - injects considerable humor and lots of edgy anger into his screen version.
1,"At its best, L.I.E. ... offers a rich, dark, bitter slice of contemporary life. But the film's arty embellishments undermine its bleak vision, making it, in the end, a little too easy to take."
1,Both unnervingly frank and disarmingly human.
1,A powerful and provocative achievement.
0,Confused and disjointed.
1,A penetrating look at a 14-year-old boy's relationship with a pederast.
1,Cuesta's film never succumbs to Larry Clark-esque seediness. The film's take on Oliver Twist is utterly dispassionate and all the more creepy and compelling for offering us no clues as to what will happen between Big John and Howie.
1,"A well-acted, provocative coming-of-age story."
1,"You know you're in the hands of a born filmmaker when he floods a scene with danger and excitement and, at the same time, tempers it with something more delicate."
1,"The suspense -- and, indeed, the art -- comes from not knowing which road Howie will take."
1,"A provocative, upsetting film."
1,It is the work of a young director with something to say.
1,Superior and original filmmaking. You won't be able to take your eyes off it.
1,"Its director, Michael Cuesta, has the stubborn curiosity of an artist who won't settle for formulas but is intrigued by the secrets and mysteries of his characters."
1,A disturbing and provocative study of adolescence and isolation.
1,A wonderfully acted film and a courageous one.
1,This is a very unsettling film that left me shaking long after I left the theater.
1,"A bold, distinctly independent film."
1,A boldly imaginative yet subtle exploration of male sexuality.
1,Difficult and flawed feature debut.
1,"Gripping, troubling, and deftly acted."
1,One of the most provocative independent films of the year.
0,"Recoiling from L.I.E. is a very human, and frankly a very responsible, reaction."
1,"A mature, insightful and extremely well-acted study."
1,Cuesta never gives us the satisfaction of fulfilling our expectations; instead he gives us a movie that we can ponder long the road takes its final turn.
0,
1,
1,"A striking, unnerving coming-of-age film, ""L.I.E."" is the rare American movie that isn't afraid of ambiguity or confronting an audience's preconceptions."
1,"Even in its least interesting moments, L.I.E should be credited for attempting to put an edgy kind of truth on camera."
0,A music video shot by a Cops camera crew on crystal meth.
0,"Even fans of open-wheel racing, the high-speed, high-stress pastime that is the subject of Renny Harlin's hectic new film, may walk away from it more logy than exhilarated."
0,Driven looks as fake as it feels.
0,"A slick, simplistic, and laughable effort that's reminiscent of a bad Jerry Bruckheimer film. A really bad Bruckheimer film."
0,"Unless you find car racing to be a nearly orgasmic experience, Driven offers little in the way of entertainment."
1,"The target audience of men, young and old, will admire the pedal-to-the-metal action and not be in the least bit put off by its rudimentary characters and silly plot dynamics."
0,A good deal of Driven is pure ephemera.
0,"Driven is mostly preposterous, and it has no dramatic center, but the racing scenes hold you in their death-trip grip."
0,"A silly, overexaggerated movie."
0,"A loud, frantic racing commercial."
0,Sylvester Stallone's homoerotic car-racing actioner delivers something between Speed Racer and gay porn.
0,Why waste your quarters on the video games in the mall when you can pay $10 to see the same thing on the big screen?
0,Driven is one of those wince-inducing movies that makes you wonder if every single person involved was deliberately trying to embarrass themselves.
0,Driven is all over the map in more ways than one.
0,A paint-by-numbers affair.
0,"Driven, to put it bluntly, makes Days of Thunder look like Citizen Kane on Wheels."
0,Pushing his pointless technique way ahead of any kind of content-to say nothing of drama -- Harlin eliminates any danger of intimacy.
0,Gas -- the hot air variety -- is exactly what Driven is made of.
1,"In his first solo writing credit since Rocky V (1990), Stallone has turned out an old-fashioned sports drama that thrives by knowing when to wallow in clichs and when to turn them on their heads."
0,Comically corny and crude speedway drama.
0,"But for all its remarkable technology, Driven can't escape the cliches of the genre."
0,A film that comes at you like a flashing strobe light.
1,The racing footage will blow you away.
0,"A movie by, for and about the Attention Deficit Disordered."
0,"When the film predictably limps across the finish line, you're left with the impression your time would have been better spent sitting in traffic."
0,A race-car drama full of flashy but empty images and a soundtrack that makes you feel as if you're being shaken on a motel rumblebed.
0,"Though Harlin's skill compensates for a lot of narrative preposterousness, even it is overmatched this time around."
0,"Predictable, risible but with flashes of directorial inspiration from Renny Harlin, this is less driven, more being taken for a ride."
0,
0,
0,"By no means a great -- or even a particularly good -- movie, but its sustained nastiness shows a stunning disregard for box-office niceties."
0,"Ace in the Hole is badly weakened by a poorly constructed plot, which depends for its strength upon assumptions that are not only naive but absurd."
1,"This 1951 film, about a cynical reporter who seizes on the plight of a man trapped in a mine shaft to promote his career, is cold, lurid, and fascinating, propelled by the same combination of moral outrage and sneaky admiration."
1,"As a diatribe against all that is worst in human nature, it has moments dipped in pure vitriol."
1,"A lurid pulp indictment of exploitation, opportunism, doctored intelligence, torture for profit, insatiable greed, and shady journalism."
1,"Ace in the Hole is a revelation, as timely now as when it was made."
1,"In a lesser movie, Tatum would share our sympathy for the pathetic man. Here, he's on a parabola in that direction but wants it to intersect with the moment of his own greatest fame."
0,Blood splashes everywhere and soaks the audience.
0,The movie's second half ... is tedious and uninspired.
0,Am I the only one who finds [Kitano's] films impossible to make heads or tails of?
1,"Riveting, if erratic."
1,"If the film had ended a couple of scenes earlier, on a touch that's a tribute to westerns and showdowns, Mr. Kitano would have finished things off beautifully. But that's a minor quibble."
0,Takeshi's elliptical directorial style is here overwhelmed by the script's crudeness and lack of narrative power.
0,An awkward hybrid of Kitano yakuza satire and 'hood drama.
1,"When it works, which is often, Kitano's movie is an anthropology of the distinctions between Japanese yakuza and American gangsters."
0,We're made numb to the violence and bored by the lack of plot or character development.
1,"What [Kitano fans are] looking for are increasingly novel and outrageous ways to ambush, mutilate and assassinate. And their hero doesn't disappoint."
0,"For all its arty bloodshed, Brother is disappointingly hollow."
0,Just how many acts of self-inflicted finger amputations do I really want to see?
1,Sure to satisfy fans of the laconic auteur.
1,Kitano presents all this mayhem in crisp and cool camera work that distances it and keeps it from becoming oppressive.
1,Intriguing though uneven.
1,A provocative variation on moviedom's worn cross-cultural themes.
0,This somber and bloody retread is hardly the best place to first make Kitano's intimidating acquaintance.
0,Rarely has such an artful aesthetic been used to craft such sadistically violent junk.
0,"Too many of the killing scenes have a casual, perfunctory tone."
0,There's nothing noble about Aniki's steadfastness; he's a violent thug who's simply more skilled and efficient than the other thugs surrounding him.
1,"As an actor and writer-director, Mr. Kitano projects an amused irony that makes his films worth seeing."
1,"Kitano's most enjoyable, flat-out fun movie, provided you can stomach the violence."
1,The performers bring the bluesy story to life in a pleasing chemistry that could have just as easily not happened with other performers.
0,"This is all about getting your life back on course before you can fall in love. Which isn't such a bad idea for a movie, as long as there's something more. Unfortunately, there isn't."
0,"Watching Angel Eyes is akin to listening to a confessional that's long, repetitive and rambling."
1,"It's just that kind of movie, perfect for a certain mood, for guilt-free wallowing in a star-crossed tale of romance."
0,"On the heels of parts in Frequency and Play it Forward, [Caviezel] just exudes otherworldliness. This sends the physics of this romantic melodrama into the Twilight Zone from whence it never returns."
1,An emotionally honest effort.
0,"The movie, a cumbersome dud, grows draggier with each new revelation."
0,"Angel Eyes is high-concept schmaltz, full of short cuts to emotion laid over chasms of improbability."
1,"A lot like Caviezel's earlier and popular flick Frequency. It may not be great moviemaking, but it does work."
0,It really only takes two words -- sloppy and sappy -- to describe Angel Eyes.
0,"Angel Eyes can be downright silly, like when a moony Lopez pieces together the dandelion puffball that Caviezel gave her days ago. Just like the movie, it irretrievably falls apart."
0,Angel Eyes is really nothing more than a love story between two people who could save a lot of money by moving in together.
0,A jumbled mess.
1,"A well-acted character study of a hardworking woman, by a screenwriter (Gerald DiPego) and a director with enough integrity to dispense with the usual Hollywood distractions."
0,A snooze.
0,"As that mystery unravels, so does the film, growing less interesting and more conventionally schmaltzy by the minute."
0,"The two stars have chemistry, but this romantic mystery is finally too lugubrious for a performer with the energy reserves of Lopez."
0,The product is so synthetic it has only attitude where its heart ought to be.
0,"Angel Eyes is so dull and marshmallowy, not even Lopez's naturally piquant charm can liven it up. It's a mopefest."
1,A carefully crafted romantic drama of considerable insight and emotional impact that provides Lopez an acting challenge she meets with ease.
0,"Instead of being permitted to watch two adults find each other in some believable way, the audience is subjected to a lot of extraneous nonsense."
1,This second half of the movie is almost as promising as the first. But the total abandonment of the initial tone and narrative strategy feels like a bait-and-switch scam.
0,"Cut through all the eerie atmospherics and ominous implications, and Angel Eyes is just another glossily romantic meditation on pain and fate."
0,The script is obvious and conflicted.
0,"Features the dullest, most poorly matched romantic couple since Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron lit up the screen in Sweet November."
1,"Putting aside her last two choices, The Cell and The Wedding Planner, it seems J.Lo can deliver when given the right material and the right director."
1,A surprisingly effective film.
0,"The writing is capable but never really stylish, and that's what, in spite of heavenly aspirations, keeps Angel Eyes totally earthbound."
1,"Angel Eyes is worth an investment of patience, although rather less of an investment would have been a welcome thing."
0,A tearjerking romantic confection that ... is only partially digestible.
0,Director Luis Mandoki lets another film drown in the tear-jerker tide.
0,"Darts back and forth from being a psychological thriller to a vaguely metaphysical drama to a fate-driven romance. Such a schema may, in the right hands, make for a powerful, all-seeing movie; here, it all becomes a blur."
1,The movie works because Lopez gives such a terrific performance.
0,Mandoki doesn't have anything new to contribute to this puree of genres.
0,"Its protagonists, their situation and its mechanical but mushy resolution are never remotely believable."
0,A moribund melodrama which starts intriguingly before becoming utterly banal.
0,"Together, Lopez and Caviezel make quite a pair. Sorrowful yet hip, they seem to be inventing a new mood: designer melancholia."
0,"Lopez is fairly convincing as a tough cookie by day and a lonesome soft-centre by night, but despite their best efforts, neither she nor Caviezel can fight free of the turgid script."
0,Neither one for the dogs nor the cat's pajamas.
1,"Schneider manages to make it all more palatable than nauseating, genial rather than an affront to good taste."
0,"If I had a mob, I'd send it after the yo-yos at Columbia Pictures who gave this pu-pu platter the green light."
1,"This may be giving Schneider too much credit, but the lad has found a way to temporarily halt the de-evolution of the silly comedy."
1,"A lunkheaded, sorta gross-out comedy that manages to be likeable and funny."
1,"Next to Joe Dirt, The Animal is tolerably amusing."
0,Flat-footed and half-hearted.
0,There's a whole lot of stuff like The Animal to the point that there's no longer anything outrageous about its outrageousness.
0,OK lowbrow comedy about a man given superpowers by animal organ transplants.
1,"Its relative modesty lends Mr. Schneider's deft, ingenuous performance an unexpected glow of innocence."
1,"An outrageous and imaginative summer comedy aimed primarily at young males, but it is often so funny that it may well connect to a broader audience."
0,Neither as bad as it might be nor as entertaining as it should be.
1,"A good natured comedy of hormonally charged, down in the mud slapstick."
0,"While it's true that Colleen gets her backside slapped, that her face is licked by Rob Schneider and that he urinates under her chair as a way of marking his territory, it's no worse than what he does to the audience."
0,Its inability to muster more laughs than groans will have even Schneider's diehard fans longing for the merely awful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.
0,Let's hear it for stupendously dumb screen writing.
0,Frequently it becomes boring.
0,It's just not funny.
0,"Should you consider getting near it, understand that it doesn't smell so good."
0,Anyone not committed to cheap crude humor may find The Animal more creepy than funny.
0,"A silly, stupid story with a one-joke comic premise."
1,"The Animal is never more nor less than stupid, but stupid in ways that deliver goofiness rather than rampant humiliation."
0,Certainly reeks like something produced from a squatting position.
1,"If you want a giggle and are not too fussy, you could do much worse than surrendering to its shamelessly puerile brand of smutty schoolboy humour."
0,
1,Visually witty and even marvelous when it comes to depicting the spectacular creatures.
1,"It's skit comedy on a grand scale, but the juvenilia has a good-natured spirit, light years removed from the meanness that has entered comedy of late."
0,"Evolution is bad. How bad? Who cares? Do you ask how hot the fire is before running out of a burning building? No, you just run for safety."
1,A fitfully funny sci-fi comedy.
0,"It's called Evolution, but the would-be comedy about an alien life form that crashes to Earth and spawns mutants with enormous sphincters is quite the devolution from Ghostbusters."
0,"The movie itself evolves in reverse, starting life as a moderately clever grab bag of high-concept noodling and half-witty badinage before descending into the primordial ooze of explosions and elaborate lower- intestinal gags."
0,Evolution doesn't deserve to spawn sequels.
0,An excruciating misfire.
0,"The film contains enough dull stretches to make you wonder whether Mr. Reitman has lost his touch -- or, in fact, if he ever really had one."
0,"Evolution amusing, not very involving."
0,"The movie itself, I'm sorry to report, is more devolution than evolution, a lazy lampoon that draws from grade-Z sci-fi and Reitman's own uproarious Ghostbusters."
0,"The following is a transcript of Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman's pitch to investors about his new movie, which eventually would take the name Evolution. Actually, it's bogus, but it saved the reviewer some time and adjectives."
1,Not as dumb as you might think.
0,Leaves the audience wondering if Hollywood has already been taken over by aliens who are trying to numb our minds with mediocre films like this one.
0,Has more rear-end gags than a toga party at a proctology convention.
0,I laughed -- but mostly to keep from getting depressed about the devolution of mainstream movies.
0,"There's something weird, and it don't look good."
0,"Flat, rickety and enervated."
0,Feels like [the script] was cranked out to meet a deadline.
0,It's refried comic beans that smell stale and smack of desperation.
0,Most likely outcome: Extinction.
0,"If you loved Ghostbusters, you'll hate this."
1,"Somewhat refreshingly aspiring to be nothing more than a disposable summer popcorn movie, this is a flick that delivers more smiles than laughs and has some wonderful special effects."
1,"For a guy who has spent the better part of his career as the poster boy for towering intellect, David Duchovny is pretty damn funny."
1,"Reitman adopts a light, whimsical touch in his character scenes and doesn't allow the broader comic setups or the alien special effects to take over the movie."
0,Reitman made this movie in 1984. It was called Ghostbusters.
0,"It's loud, silly and a bloated mess, but still twice as good as Pearl Harbor, because it puts you back on the street in half the time."
1,Passable low comedy that at least manages to not send you out of the theater feeling depressed.
0,"Nowhere near as bad as most recent comedies; it has real laughs, but it misses real opportunities."
0,Seems to have been made without a writer.
1,An enjoyable caper that might be a little too intense for kids.
1,
1,This movie has 'guilty pleasure' written all over it.
1,"If you're 14 and love Limp Bizkit, or 50 and yearn to lay down some rubber, chances are you'll think this honey corners like it's on rails."
1,Will appeal to the inner juvenile delinquent in all of us.
0,"The movie is pretty funny, except it's not a comedy."
0,A massive compendium of youth-movie/ pedal-to-the-metal cliches.
0,"Since we've become a nation of 9-mile-per-gallon, automatic-transmission SUV-driving sissies, a movie about the blood-curdling speed you can achieve in a Honda Civic is probably all we deserve."
1,"There's some undeniable appeal to watching a well-oiled, built-for-speed machine operating with its pedal to the metal."
1,"Even if your life doesn't revolve around your carburetor, the movie is a kicky guilty pleasure."
1,"Diesel, Brewster and Rodriguez have undeniable charisma, while Walker is serviceable in his role."
0,The young and the restless with gas fumes.
1,Cohen ... at least knows how to keep matters moving and the action sequences exciting.
0,The narrative takes a gutless turn and replaces the central (and exciting) conflict with a whole different set of villains.
1,"It's a formula movie, to be sure, but it's Formula One."
0,"Rob Cohen, who last directed The Skulls -- ouch! -- can consider this one another career-killing skid mark."
1,"Guilt-free pleasure, the sort that wears its trashiness on its sleeve and exults in it."
0,Such a drag that it ends up doing something hard to imagine: it makes you long for the soulless professionalism of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
0,"Yes, the whole thing is pretty dumb, and every character and every situation is familiar from better movies."
1,An action picture that's surprising in the complexity of its key characters and portents of tragedy.
0,"These gear-heads may spout car-talk like know-it-alls, but they sound no less nerdy than trivia-obsessed Trekkers."
1,"Has B-movie grit, with sexy young actors, even sexier cars and the smarts to realize a teen movie will only work if you empathize with its characters."
1,The disconcertingly but finally happy surprise of the picture comes with the way it persuades you to its perverse point of view.
1,It's been a long time since we've had a junky exploitation movie we could really fall for. The Fast and the Furious is that movie.
1,Breathes life and fire -- and fury -- into the old hot-rod movie.
0,"Screenwriters Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer haven't really written a movie, they've followed a formula."
1,"It delivers what it promises to deliver, and knows that a chase scene is supposed to be about something more than special effects."
0,Doesn't manage to deliver the wild ride it promises.
1,It jumps off the screen with the mindless panache of a good bad movie.
0,The guys in F & F are all wusses. Lara Croft and Charlie's Angels could kick all of their asses.
1,"Even those who've never heard of 'rice rockets' (Japanese imports souped up with computerized hydraulics and customized engines) might be charmed by the film's blend of kineticism, car-culture rituals, and hilariously flat-footed dialogue."
1,"May not have much of a brain, but it's definitely got a pulse."
0,"Works hard to be exciting, but the movie scarcely lives up to its title."
1,"A visceral, high-octane, Formula One of a flick that puts the pedal to the metal in the opening minutes and does not take the foot off the accelerator until the end credits."
0,"Could you keep the noise down a touch, Vin? You're going to wake up the audience."
1,"It doesn't matter that we know where it's going, what counts is that Cohen keeps his pedal to the floor and that his actors gun their lines with absolute conviction. Loud cars, fast music: this movie knows exactly what it's about."
0,"Returning the series to solid ground after 2 Fast 2 Furious leaned too heavily on cartoonish CGI effects, Tokyo Drift relies on old-fashioned stunt work that gives its best sequences a sense of brute physicality."
1,"A gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car meller is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitationer, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed."
1,"While few of the paper-thin characters register long enough to make much of an impression, Diesel carries the movie with his unsettling mix of Zen-like tranquillity and barely controlled rage."
0,"Superbly marketed, Pearl Harbor is the very model of a modern blockbuster. Will it matter that almost nothing about its human drama rings true?"
0,"Perhaps they should have called this 'Bore-a, Bore-a, Bore-a.'"
0,"Nearly every line of the script drops from the actors' mouths with the leaden clank of exposition, timed with bad sitcom beats."
0,"After the first few minutes, it's just fireworks and bodies in motion."
1,"Bay, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the entire cast and crew have given us a Pearl Harbor to remember."
0,"Strangely, though, after all of the movie's manipulations and the big events, we don't get a sense at the end that we've accompanied the characters through a journey."
0,"Bay's overdirection... makes Hallmark-card images of the young lovers against backgrounds of lush vegetation and fiery explosions, and the end results are oddly remote, lacking any real emotion."
0,"A lot of people will rightfully be crowing about the technically astonishing battle scenes that take up over an hour of screen time. But getting there is a cliche-ridden, often laughable chore."
1,"The central romance of Pearl Harbor is serviceable enough, and Affleck and Beckinsale really bring it home."
0,Surprise attacks should be swift and penetrating. Neither adjective applies to Pearl Harbor.
0,"From its opening calendar-art sunrise to the There You'll Be love theme that Faith Hill sings over the final credits, Pearl Harbor is deep-down phony."
0,A script with the most underdeveloped characters and spectacularly realized visuals since Titanic.
0,"When no one's fighting, it's mostly a blindingly tedious soap opera, complete with an unexciting love triangle, a pushy musical score, a miraculous feat by a disabled character and an equally miraculous revival of one of the heroes."
0,"It's all smoke and fireballs, spectacle without any real punch."
0,Better to wait until it's available on video and you have the option of using a fast-forward button.
0,"Unfortunately, pasted around that stunning [action] sequence is a story so clogged with cliches of every description, so overblown, bombastic and agonizingly sentimental that it's hard to watch it with a straight face."
0,The filmmakers are incapable of infusing history with soap opera immediacy.
0,"Ships, planes and water combust and collide in Pearl Harbor, but nothing else does in one of the wimpiest wartime romances ever filmed."
0,"It blows up as good as anything movie technology has yet detonated, and it leaves you feeling absolutely, incontrovertibly numb."
0,Pearl Harbor is essentially Top Gun with period costumes and the campy homoeroticism in check.
0,"Bay takes the easy way out with this movie, shunning the real pain of the attack to concentrate on the shallow feelings of his stars."
1,It gets the job done.
0,Such a bloodless picture that it neither insults nor honors the memory of these soldiers.
0,"A starchy, overpowering helping of red, whiete and blue kitsch served up with piping-hot bombast."
0,The bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history.
0,"Pearl Harbor is superficial, melodramatic and too long -- and that's the good news."
1,"An indulgently paced three hours, the picture is nearly painstaking in its traditionalism."
0,"The attack sequence in Pearl Harbor shows technical smarts to spare. Where matters of emotional and political truth are concerned, it's crude and jingoistic beyond compare."
0,"Most of it is just mediocre bull, the same sort of empty bluster we've come to expect from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay when the weather warms."
0,Wins at war but loses at love.
0,The date that will live in infamy has been reduced to a movie that is mired in mediocrity.
1,"All the jolt that computer graphics can offer, Pearl Harbor supplies."
0,"An unremarkable action movie; Pearl Harbor supplies the subject, but not the inspiration."
1,"For sheer eye-popping spectacle, makes Titanic look like a kiddies' bath toy."
0,The net result of this mighty effort is perhaps predictable: near total inconsequence.
0,Mostly tests one's patience with unseaworthy dialogue and performers drowning in oily cliches.
0,"Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale give performances of such somnambulist awfulness that the three of them achieve an almost zen-like state of woodenness."
0,The woe and horror of the event is steamrolled by a sur+ of special and digitized effects.
1,"For my money a much better heartbreaker, thrillmaker and tear-tweaker than Titanic."
0,This bunk is history.
0,"Brawny but brainless, Pearl Harbor is another bloated, irresponsible example of history according to Disney-a lame juggernaut that falsifies the facts, assaults the senses and leaves you blind, deaf and soulless."
0,"The bombs explode brilliantly but the story is a bust in ""Pearl Harbor."""
0,"Pearl Harbor is a bomb, make no mistake. But the movie is such a noisy, persistent bomb that it is guaranteed to draw a crowd."
0,"For all the 118 actors listed, the movie offers almost no sense of authentic humanity. The faces the filmmakers plaster on their characters are as flat and stereotyped as those on war-recruitment posters."
0,"Leave it to Bay and Bruckheimer to reduce one of America's biggest military tragedies into a three-hour avalanche of Kodak moments, and one of America's defining crises into a facile exercise in fake uplift."
0,Three hours and three minutes of guff and goo about the nobility of killing and/or being killed for arbitrary reasons.
1,"The centerpiece is the attack. For 50 minutes, the filmmakers unleash nonstop eye candy."
0,"Pearl Harbor is a blockheaded, hollow-hearted industrial enterprise."
1,"The best way to see the movie is as I did: expecting nothing and being pleasantly surprised, and strangely moved, by Mr. Bay's audacity in filming his lovers in end-of-the-world close-ups, however briefly."
0,"The effect of watching a Michael Bay film is indistinguishable from having a large, pointy lump of rock drop on your head. His new picture, Pearl Harbor, maintains the mood."
1,There's a wild imagination at work here.
1,Another blast of crackpot outlaw genius from the Hong Kong we thought had died when the mainland Chinese became landlords.
0,Audiences looking for an action-adventure diversion that's easy to track are sure to get lost in a plot so ever-thickening as to be virtually impenetrable.
1,"Not nearly as lyrical, sustained, eccentric, or sincerely romantic as it would like to be, although there's plenty to admire."
1,"Unlike many movies that you will see this summer, Tsui Hark's Time and Tide gives you your money's worth and then some."
1,The presence of flesh-and-blood actors and stunt people create an urgency lacking in the obviously fabricated Mummy effects.
0,There is nothing in the movie worth looking at.
1,The movie-est movie of the year.
1,"At its most compulsive, this is the only action flick you'll need this summer."
0,Proves once again that it doesn't matter if the camera is dancing a jig on the ceiling if the storytelling is no good.
0,"Though a certain adrenaline rush comes from the jazzed-up filmmaking, there's not much going on."
1,Makes for compulsive viewing even though its noirish plot doesn't make a lick of sense.
1,"Goofy, outlandish and exhilarating."
1,
0,
1,A deeply eloquent film about an especially difficult period in China's recent past.
1,A nicely realized love story.
0,"Yimou's strongest films always doubled as valentines to the porcelain face of former muse Gong Li, but here, reiterative beauty-worship is something of an end in itself."
1,"Without postcard prettiness, he lays the beauties of this village and its mountains before us so quietly and proudly that a warrant of nativity, of belonging, suffuses the film."
1,"Ms. Zhang's intensely concentrated performance conveys a current of stubborn, obsessive passion lurking behind Di's girlish wide-eyed innocence."
1,"The film is lovely, life-affirming, and guaranteed to make you cry."
1,"The director finds poetry in the face of his lead actress, whose performance is as luminous and moving as the film itself."
1,Zhang Ziyi proves in her film debut what a powerhouse force she is on-screen.
1,A moving love story that is as simple in its narrative gestures as it is rich in color composition.
1,"A beautifully simple romantic fable set in 1958 China in which the lovers are never seen touching, much less kissing -- yet it can move you to tears."
1,"The film is also a showcase for Zhang Ziyi, who is never less than enchanting."
1,It works. It feels like a slice of life.
1,Has deep rewards for those who surrender to its lulling rhythm.
1,"The Road Home yields its pleasures slowly, opening in wintry black and white before ripening into a miracle."
1,As luminous as the star presence at its center.
1,This is a film that rescues love from the world of clich and treats it with the awakening passion it deserves.
1,"The film is laced with gentle humor, and its simple story is built on a sure foundation of humaneness."
0,"Of course, the past always looks better in retrospect, especially to those who have never done without indoor plumbing."
1,Zhang brings to it his masterly gift for visual composition.
1,"A gentle, engaging narrative of constancy and devotion against all odds."
1,Celebrates a beauty and heroism around us that we often miss in both our movies and our lives.
1,Zhang Yimou focuses so frequently on Ziyi's face in extreme close-up that she sticks like a daguerreotype to your retina -- and then your heart.
1,"A layered, delicately but surely romantic tribute to the simplicity and grace of a bygone era."
1,"If this film's coda doesn't move you to tears, you'd better make an appointment with your cardiologist."
1,"This movie may be descended from the [original] Apes, but it exceeds it at almost every turn."
1,"As it is, it's one of Burton's lesser works -- above the goofy Mars Attacks!, but below Sleepy Hollow and his Batman films when it comes to earnest adventure."
0,Planet of the Apes isn't a real Burton movie; it's just another summer title in a monkey suit.
0,"It doesn't take a brain, or even opposable thumbs, to make a summer movie."
0,"The most disappointing aspect of Planet of the Apes is that, despite its presentation, the film is so very ordinary, without urgency or revelation."
0,"The sad truth about Planet of the Apes is that, disappointingly, it's just not very much fun to watch."
0,"Begins with both polish and promise and boasts consistently strong visuals. But plot structure, never a Burton forte, dissolves in a fizzle of fits and start, and the ending is a real groaner."
0,"It's a shame, because visually the film is astounding. Burton's bold style and unique point of view are front and center. Yet Apes is a classic example of 'all dressed up with nowhere to go.'"
0,"Burton and his screenwriters are not clear about whether they want to send up the original, itself a campy cautionary tale, or whether they want to rethink it."
0,"A visually extravagant but curiously flat, muted adventure -- one so lackadaisically plotted and structured that it's easy to lose track of what is happening on the screen, even though there's never much to keep track of to begin with."
1,"This century's Planet of the Apes is a rouser, a screaming-banshee fun house."
0,The movie isn't interested in scoring any genuine cultural points; it just recycles second-hand social cliches while biding time for the big chases and generic action scenes.
0,"Features backlot spectacle, a cast of hundreds battle, a weak whisper of gladiatorial vengeance -- everything, in fact, but imagination."
1,Works equally well as a popcorn adrenaline-heart-pumper as it does a pop-philosophical inquiry into the nature of humanity.
0,"Burton provides plenty of eye candy and a few giggles, but ultimately his film has little soul."
1,The summer blockbuster we've been waiting for.
1,"There's one reason to see Tim Burton's flawed, somewhat declawed but often amusing do-over of Planet of the Apes. The apes."
0,"By the time the picture rattled to its confusing and badly conceived ending, I couldn't help wishing it had somehow added up to more."
0,"Tim Roth dominates as the big bad ape, the set design is inspired, but you might say the human element is lacking. And that ending? Possibly written by a chimp."
1,"The movie can be both a gas and distant, a toy sealed in its unbreakable box."
1,"Easily the best of this summer's generally rotten serving of popcorn movies, Planet keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly two hours."
1,"This summer's most beautiful, most exciting and most intelligent new movie."
0,"The movie fails to rise to the high emotional and imaginative standards Burton has set for himself in such films as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and the first two Batman movies."
1,"Mission accomplished, and in high style."
0,"As is all too familiar with modern adventure movies, it gets trapped in formula - big action scenes that offer few surprises, a predictable story arc, dialogue peppered with cliched bon mots and obligatory big ideas that are spoken rather than dramatized."
0,"Ten years from now, it will be the 1968 version that people are still renting."
0,The picture just feels listless at the centre.
0,This will not be remembered as the finest hour for Burton's neo-Goth sensibilities.
0,"Offers proof of Hollywood's simian instincts: Monkey see old hit, monkey do remake."
0,One more disappointment in a summer of lackluster 'event pictures.'
0,"A campy, juiced-up ker-splat, busy with clumsy pyrotechnics and never nearing the vicinity of satire."
0,"A lightweight, slight movie which only looks savagely convincing."
0,"Call it a letdown, worsened by the forces of shoddy screenwriting."
1,Splendidly envisioned and boldly executed.
0,"There's nothing you can't see coming in this flick, including the surprise ending."
0,Attends to its heist-thriller obligations with needless solemnity and a studious lack of imagination.
1,Got class and smarts that put recent bombastic heist flicks such as Swordfish and 3000 Miles to Graceland to shame.
0,A handsomely mounted yawn.
0,A routine heist drama distinguished only by the names above the title.
1,The best heist flick since The Usual Suspects.
1,"The acting amplitude of Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton gives Frank Oz's finely wrought film dimensions and resonance rare in a heist drama."
0,"Like a diet cola, The Score has fizz, but very little savor and no calories to speak of."
1,"A top-drawer heist movie that ratchets up the tension inch by careful inch, The Score will remind you of classic caper films of the past, and that is a good thing."
1,"With its star lineup, The Score is an important film that allows its cast room to explore the characters."
1,De Niro and Norton play off of each other beautifully.
0,"There are explosions, double-crosses and chase sequences, but it just doesn't add up to edge-of-your-seat tension."
1,"Isn't a noir masterpiece, like Rififi, but then, with Brando, De Niro and Norton acting up a storm, maybe it doesn't need to be."
1,"Could've been so much more, but the stars make it worth checking out."
1,"A smart, satisfying throwback to the days when editing still allowed for a little breathing room."
1,"A movie which gets the job done as simply, efficiently and intelligently as possible."
0,"A droning, high-toned little heist picture with no dash and no raison d'tre."
1,"Like The Score itself, there are moments when we get a little lost, when we even get dull for a while. But if approached right, growing older can leave us feeling invigorated. Just like The Score."
1,A solid suspense thriller that's fun.
0,The movie is so determinedly low-key that after a while it sits on the screen like a layout from Architectural Digest. Even the actors seem dimmed.
0,"Spends so much time establishing a shadowy, jazzy neo-noir tone that the details of the heist are slighted and much of the excitement drains away."
1,It is the human spectacle of three of America's finest screen actors passing on their wisdom and gifts from one generation to the next that lends this movie a self-reflexive glow and lifts it above the clichs on which it is constructed.
0,"A spiritless, unimaginative exercise in professionalism for its own sake."
1,Frank Oz keeps the suspense taut and doesn't have to resort to gratuitous violence to get our adrenaline going.
1,Its single-mindedness still makes for a refreshing change from the preposterous bloat of most contemporary action movies.
0,"As heist movies go, this one is on the low side of mediocre."
1,"Alternating on trumpet and tenor sax, Norton does some terrific solos. De Niro is the ace drummer providing rhythmic backbone, and Brando tickles out gorgeous filigrees on piano."
1,"Oz allows both stars more time than they deserve to flesh out their characters. Still, it's fascinating to watch these two superb actors in highly detailed turns."
1,"After sitting through such sloppy and reckless high-concept heist films as Mission: Impossible and Entrapment, it's refreshing to witness the careful, methodical attention to details that distinguishes The Score."
1,The best pure heist movie in recent years.
1,"Nobody's going to think of The Score as trail-blazing, but there's nothing small-time about its dramatic and acting payoff."
1,"Contains The Scene, a precious sequence already destined for infinite repetition."
1,A sturdily diverting old fashioned heist thriller.
1,"Restoring the seductive style of the no-nonsense procedural heist movie to complete luster, this is the kind of pic that knows the difference between being masculine and being macho."
0,Manages to waste a prestigious cast on a tediously long-winded caper plot.
1,Oz courts first-rate performances from each of his stars.
0,"As capers go, Heist is considerably less than thrilling."
0,"While staccato dialogue and edgy confrontations have always been the wordsmith's forte, the precision-tooled mechanics of an elaborate crime caper have not, and the physical direction here could use some muscle."
1,"Heist not only reminds us that there's a little larceny in all of us, but reminds us as well how much fun it can be to commune with our inner thief."
1,"The cast is brilliant, the plotting ingenious, the dialogue incendiary."
1,Mamet serves up a satisfying entree.
1,"It's consistently fun, occasionally funny, and will have viewers on the edges of their seats on more than one occasion."
1,"A neat, bouncy, minor-key crime procedural that shakes no rafters."
1,"Mamet doesn't just give us an enthralling heist flick, he makes the language something to savor."
0,Passable but never exciting.
1,"For fans of The Sting and other classic cons, this will sound like jackpot time. For others, who prefer their capers less tidy or self-consciously clever, this exercise may carry all the excitement of a drugged mouse in a maze."
0,A whirl of action going nowhere fast.
1,What Heist lacks in novelty it makes up for in solid entertainment.
1,"Heist is Mamet's biggest and most accessible thriller to date, and if you've never seen any of his films, the movie will work its devilish magic. But for the initiated, Heist carries a whiff of disappointment."
1,"Heist lacks the smugness of Mr. Mamet's State and Main but never reaches the wit-quota of his The Spanish Prisoner and Wag the Dog. Even if it's not memorable Mamet, it's a largely intriguing movie."
0,Not awful but nowhere near as good as it should have been.
1,A perfectly pleasurable ride.
0,A minor work by a major guy.
1,It's less plot-driven than The Score but is more satisfying because of what Mamet leaves out.
1,"David Mamet drives us crazy with a characteristically convoluted caper film that's a lot more about attitude and sleight of hand than it is about action. Mischievous, but you really have to go with the flow."
1,A hard-boiled winner.
1,"Full of action and suspense, Heist is above all a gratifyingly adult entertainment."
1,There are dialogue-driven scenes in this movie that will blow you away -- nobody writes like Mamet at the top of his game.
0,"Essentially a genre piece overdecorated with phrases, quirks and narrative slipknots with a mannered look-at-me cleverness."
1,"If it piles on more psychological fake-outs than is safe in a setup this size -- well, at least it's got that talk, that language, that thing Mamet does that is at this point as identifiable as the cadences of the Bard."
0,"Rare for Mamet, that talk here sometimes comes off as strained and awkward, or as a slightly highbrow variation on the usual hackneyed bon mots of generic action films."
0,"Once you recognize that each new development is nothing more than a prelude to another con, any sense of tension is moot."
1,"Heist is the kind of caper movie that was made before special effects replaced wit, construction and intelligence."
1,"Mamet's cerebral thriller is a joy to watch -- this is easily the director's toughest, grittiest drama to date."
0,"There's something offensive about how Mamet continues to win praise as a serious filmmaker with such a joyless picture, a picture that -- intentionally -- gives the audience so little."
1,"The movie is super fun, even if some of its tricks seem to strain credulity."
0,"This cast is excellent. Heist, though, proves that enormously talented people can make a pretty lousy movie."
1,"I couldn't believe any of it on any level, though it could be described as 'fun.'"
1,One of the most elegantly suspenseful ghost stories in years.
1,"This is one scary movie, not because we see ghosts or monsters, but because Kidman makes us feel her fear as our own."
1,The Others stands apart merely for recognizing that animatronic gargoyles are no substitute for unhinged neuroses.
1,"Even at its most plodding, the film causes more gasps than yawns."
1,This narrative-twisty story is helped by strong performances.
0,"A stylish attention-getter, the movie eventually wears you out without offering that much."
0,"Too polite, too subdued for its own good."
1,"When it comes to turning the screws of psychological terror, Amenebar is an expert technician."
0,The film is beautiful to behold but lacking in any kind of palpable dread or suspense.
1,"The Others is a horror movie in which the scary elements are all psychological, but that doesn't mean it doesn't sometimes jolt the senses."
1,"The gimmicks, in the end, are too arbitrary to tie together in a memorably haunting fashion, though they do culminate in a Big Twist, a nifty one that almost -- but not quite -- makes you want to see the movie again."
1,"It gives you a case of the creeps oh-so slowly, then hits you with a clever, mind-warping way of saying, 'Boo!'"
1,"An old-fashioned, goose-pimply movie."
1,Mr. Serling would be pleased.
1,"Bumpy at first, with a few too many clichs and an awful lot of doors opening and closing. But by its final image -- a beautifully fading portrait through a window -- I was swept in."
0,"Clever as the film is, though, it turns out to be an exercise in narrative withholding that's more headache provoking than suspense laden."
1,"The Others is a thoughtfully chilling movie. It is not the action, but the look, sound and feel that make it nerve-racking."
0,"Creepy-verging -on-campy thriller with a great payoff, but a lot of broken promise."
0,"An unconvincing, pretentiously artsy pastiche of just about every hoary old gothic thriller you can think of."
1,"Coming near the end of a summer season filled with overproduced, underwritten movies, The Others feels like a small miracle."
1,"A welcome throwback film to an era when the thriller belonged to actors and the genre was manipulated by directors, not special effects wizards."
1,"Something that giants such as Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott and Tim Burton have not been able to match so far this year."
0,"Overall, Almenabar offers too little, too late in the story for viewers who like a sporting chance to out-think their thrillers."
0,"Is caught in its own netherworld, twixt somber and somnolent."
1,Worth seeing more than once.
0,The film has everything you want in a supernatural thriller except thrills.
1,"Kidman has thrown herself into her role as if it were Lady Macbeth on the London stage, with formidable results."
0,"In drawing out his effects, Amenabar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance."
1,"An elegantly crafted entertainment, balanced between the psychological and the supernatural."
0,"The director's technical rigor, in other words, outstrips his conceptual discipline, and midway through the film he crosses the thin boundary that separates mystery from muddle."
1,A tantalizing spine-tingler.
0,"It's atmospheric, stylish, and spooky. The plot is well thought-out and its secrets and mysteries are unveiled slowly. Unfortunately, it is also cold, distancing, and moves at a glacial pace."
1,I saw the ending a mile away and couldn't have jumped higher.
1,
1,Amenbar racks up the tension to unbearable levels in a spooky shocker that's worthy of any comparison with M Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.
1,"A welcome change of pace from most contemporary scary stories, where the shocks come with all the subtlety of flashers jumping out of park bushes."
1,"The show belongs to Kidman, and snugly tailored as it is, she's surpassingly fine."
1,"Shrewdly cast, Kidman is pitch perfect. It's a clammy, ingenious film, one of the best studio movies of the year."
1,"It is well constructed, as opposed to incompetently deconstructed."
1,"The pieces are all exceptionally well-cast -- credit producer Jana Sue Memel and casting directors Mary Margiotta and Karen Margiotta -- and none outstays its welcome, which is the great advantage of short films."
1,
1,"Reduced to 'Master Pieces Theater,' Shakespeare's text nevertheless gains in force what it loses in integrity."
1,"There's nothing embarrassing about Zeffirelli's brisk new version, nor anything particularly remarkable; it's an entirely credible, middle-of-the-road production."
1,"The style of Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet, with Mel Gibson in the title role, is robust and physical and -- don't take this the wrong way -- upbeat."
0,Gibson gives the melancholy Dane an earnest but pedestrian reading.
1,[Mel Gibson] is by far the best part of Mr. Zeffirelli's sometimes slick but always lucid and beautifully cinematic version of the play.
1,"It's a surprisingly successful venture, decked out in Anglo-Saxon styles and with a brooding, robust castle setting which oozes horse muck."
0,Performances all fall in a middle range between the competent and the lackluster.
1,It's not at all a bad film.
0,"The big problem with Big Trouble, despite a fine cast and director, is that the damn thing isn't funny."
0,The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart.
0,Contradicts itself because it's a ramshackle comedy that's both rowdy and neatly pressed.
1,"The new comedy is enjoyable, but there's always a sense that it could be better."
0,"Further proof that Sonnenfeld's career, brought to a screeching halt with the gaseous and pointless Wild Wild West, continues in the downward spiral."
0,More trouble than it's worth.
1,"On its own, Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film."
0,"It's a labored, needy comedy. The strain shows."
1,The pacing is swift and the laughs are steady.
1,A glorious mess.
1,"There are stretches of big fun in Big Trouble, and little pleasures too."
0,"Like an overloaded aircraft at that security-challenged airport, Big Trouble moves forward in fits and starts but never manages to achieve sufficient momentum for a smooth, satisfying liftoff."
1,One funny movie.
1,"The way the roundelay of partners functions, and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful."
0,"I don't think I laughed out loud once. And when you're talking about a slapstick comedy, that's a pretty big problem."
0,"Based on a novel by Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry, but has none of the writer's trademark wit."
0,"I laughed. I didn't respect myself, or the movie, one bit after that."
0,"There are so many self-consciously screwy conceits begging for laughs in this lunatic fringe Miami Vice, the prize for crudest is anyone's call."
0,"Feels haphazard, as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot."
0,"A frantic search for laughs, with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience."
0,"Too scattered, too convoluted and far too hyper to get any workable comic steam going."
0,"What director Barry Sonnenfeld surely intended to be farce now only seems forced, and even actors as self-sufficient as Allen and Russo seem utterly flummoxed."
0,"It desperately wants to be a wacky, screwball comedy, but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time."
1,A playful trifle that feels so much like a genial knockoff of Get Shorty that it might as well be called Get Shorter.
0,"A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast, but never quite gets off the ground."
0,"It's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch, yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it."
1,Manages to emerge winningly as an entertaining experience.
1,"A fast-moving, riotous comedy with a terrific ensemble cast."
0,... Big Trouble produces only a very few small chuckles.
0,"Makes for distinctly uneasy viewing, as Big Trouble's massive subtext repeatedly threatens to overwhelm its haphazardly stylized diegesis."
0,"Because the tone is so light, so genial and eager to please, the whole enterprise seems the opposite of prescient. It seems naive, almost delusional."
0,"Mostly ... Sonnenfeld mishandles the broad part of the comedic formula, preferring repetition to thematic development."
0,"In this clumsy attempt to merge farce with satire, the jokes repeatedly miss the mark."
0,"It all feels terribly contrived, like something that Woody Allen could have written in a fitful sleep."
1,"Slight but engaging, Sidewalks has the familiar feel of an old sweater."
0,"Overall, there are some amusing moments, and Graham makes the most of her thankless role, but this one can wait for the video release."
0,The genre achieves inadvertent pathos via its own obscene irrelevance.
1,"Despite a few easily identifiable flaws, Sidewalks of New York is a breezy, enjoyable motion picture that manages to be smart without demanding our undivided attention."
1,"Reminds us, deep down, of why we love New York -- and a lot of people in it."
1,None of us comes away any the wiser about love and sex and stuff.
0,Such a negligible romantic comedy that its main distinction is fleeting shots of the World Trade Center in the background.
1,"It's easily [Burns'] most-watchable movie since his debut, the 1995 Sundance hit, The Brothers McMullen."
0,"[Burns] has a hard time finding a central idea, some overall point that isn't borrowed or trite. Or both."
0,Wears out its welcome fast because of its artistic pretensions and self-absorbed characters.
0,"After a while, you start wondering where this movie is going, and then it goes nowhere."
1,"Finds the right note, of seeking optimism among the shoals of hope."
0,"This kind of sophistication-lite may go down well with many viewers right now, but Sidewalks of New York isn't much more than a student film made by a talented amateur who's in over his head."
1,"Surely, after everything this city has been through, the time is right for a breezy, captivating New York romantic comedy. Sidewalks of New York is not an especially good movie, but it will do."
0,"The characters in Sidewalks of New York look and move and self-deprecate like real humans, yet there's a lack of personalized obsession to their ticker-tape yearnings."
0,"Burns, who started strong with The Brothers McMullen, has sunk deeper and deeper into irrelevancy with each succeeding film."
1,"Its New York flavor and energies are the real thing, and it grows on you."
1,Sidewalks of New York is a love letter to a city and a populace that deserve it.
1,"My own instinct tells me that Sidewalks of New York doesn't work and doesn't go anywhere, but there are a few talented performers on display."
0,"If Sidewalks is still a pretty hard film to laugh at, that's not because it stirs horrific memories. The laughs don't come easily because the humor often feels forced."
1,The film uncovers no hidden truths about relationships except one: Romantic comedies don't have to be profound when they are as appealing as this one.
1,"As a romantic comedy on your film menu, Sidewalks of New York holds the romance and serves comedy on the side."
1,"Make no mistake, [Burn's] damn good at his singular craft, adept at building and oiling this particular machine. And it runs as smoothly as ever -- the plentiful laughs arrive right on cue, as do the occasional moments of near-poignancy."
0,"It is nice that Sidewalks reflects a younger, multiethnic New York, one in which not everybody is wealthy and middle-aged or older as Allen's New York increasingly was. But diversity is no substitute for quality."
1,"While it may not have anything new to say about love, life, or even New York, it's entertaining enough to keep you occupied while you're waiting for Woody to return to form."
0,"Shows not how far we've come since '76, but how low comic standards have sunk."
0,"Overall, the phrase 'It is what it is' has never seemed more appropriate."
0,"Hilarity ensues. Except when it doesn't, which is pretty much the entire movie."
0,Boring and desperately unfunny.
0,"It's intermittently hilarious, though more of a drag."
0,No one will claim it steals that famous old MGM motto: 'More Stars Than There Are in Heaven.'
0,"Halfhearted and badly edited, the picture itself seems stoned."
0,"A half-baked hack job that's woefully short on laughs, style, decent performances and discernible signs of technical proficiency."
1,"Like gin and juice, [Dre and Snoop are] good together."
0,Just not particularly amusing.
0,So ramshackle it's nearly enough to make you forget how tossed-together the 1976 Car Wash was.
0,More of a missed opportunity than a movie.
0,"A sloppy, harebrained movie, which looks like it was made on a fraction of the budget of one of their videos."
0,"There's precious little to listen to, laugh at or ogle."
0,A 100% feeble comedy that exposes the dire acting abilities of two otherwise well respected hip-hop artists.
0,[A] crude and boring movie.
0,"The lame, underdeveloped jokes far outweigh the fresh ones, the women are all chirpy airheads, and the whole thing hangs on a feeble storyline."
0,"Two roommates start to antagonize each other after one becomes the other's superior at an LA car wash, and the conflict is played out with grittiness and flippancy."
0,"Snoop, Dre and their buddies take it all in stride -- if they were any more laid-back, they'd be napping in their trailers."
0,Abort! Abort! It's that time of year when Hollywood releases movies it should never have made in the first place.
0,Head-scratchingly ordinary.
0,"The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary, and on both sides it falls short."
0,Turns out to be exactly what would be expected -- a formulaic action film.
1,The best that can be said about Collateral Damage is that it offers a fleeting fantasy of American invincibility at a time when we desperately crave the reality.
0,An exhausted rehash of Mr. Schwarzenegger breaking through red tape to struggle against his nemesis of the moment.
0,The violence in Collateral Damage takes on a more disconcerting tone but ultimately it's business as usual for the action star.
0,"Without September 11, Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie. Now it's a bad, embarrassing movie."
0,Ah-nuld's action hero days might be over.
0,A glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick.
0,"A leaden, predictable action flick that would be of no interest to anyone but Schwarzenegger fans."
0,"Just as in real life, you don't see Collateral Damage, you suffer it."
1,"Collateral Damage is trash, but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't."
0,"A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick, a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem."
0,"Collateral Damage is, despite its alleged provocation post-9/11, an antique, in the end. As are its star, its attitude and its obliviousness."
0,"It's the stuff of every mediocre action movie ever made and enough to make you wonder if it isn't finally time for the genre to die a quiet, dignified death."
1,"A competent, if choppy, example of thriller hokum that's more entertaining than either the director's or star's last few outings."
1,"Despite its action-in-a-can mentality, the movie's generic roots gain a new post-terror specificity that lend it an almost bombastic relevance it was never meant to have."
1,A skillfully made example of your typical Schwarzenegger action film.
0,A cathartic piece of wish fulfillment.
0,The problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball.
0,It's laughably unbelievable.
0,There are many reasons to protest this Arnold Schwarzenegger flick about firemen and terrorists. The best one is that it's a bad movie.
1,[A] slick thriller with a couple of neat plot twists and a return to form for the fiftysomething Arnold.
0,"This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another, narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse, and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing."
0,A numbingly routine Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie.
0,The result is an 'action film' mired in stasis.
0,Schwarzenegger tries hard to act but in the end the foolishness of the thriller formula becomes ridiculous.
0,A stinker.
0,"Ugly, predictable and dumb as dirt."
0,"It's not particularly bad, just deeply, painfully average."
0,Grotesquely dishonest.
0,It will be remembered less for its generic content than for the real-life events that give it an eerie resonance.
0,The film's less knee-jerk than it could have been.
1,"Inspiration and originality may be in short supply, but the movie gets the job done."
1,"The week's guilty pleasure ... a gorgeously photographed, sumptuously designed adaptation of the Dumas swashbuckler boasting the most ludicrous dialogue since director Kevin Reynolds's Waterworld."
0,"Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs, The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer."
0,A mediocre production that nevertheless will strike a deep and resonant chord with viewers.
1,"If The Count of Monte Cristo doesn't transform Caviezel into a movie star, then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago."
1,This delicious adventure of crude betrayal and elegant revenge is yummy even when reheated by director Kevin Reynolds.
1,"Solid, unpretentious, thoroughly competent film..."
0,"When Wolpert's thudding dialogue is combined with Reynolds' tendency to direct things in the most bald-faced way, the results are not good."
1,"Audiences and readers began cheering Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo in 1846, and goodwill likely will continue through the tale's latest movie reincarnation."
1,The film excels at the small touches.
1,Fine escapism (sometimes literally).
1,A rousingly old-fashioned swashbuckler with an abundance of vigorous action and nary a trace of wink-wink irony.
1,[A] pleasant diversion.
0,[An] above average piece of junk.
1,Frequently entertaining and sometimes lovely to look at.
1,"This new movie version of the Alexandre Dumas classic is the stuff of high romance, brought off with considerable wit."
0,Betrays the author's intent and makes wholesale changes in the well-known plot.
1,It's a Count for our times.
0,You can count on snoozing.
1,"It's a fine, old-fashioned-movie movie, which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance."
1,"Neither among the best nor the worst of the lot, it falls somewhere inconspicuously in between, serving up both lively and ill-fitting performances as well as lush backdrops and the requisite derring-do."
1,It's quite entertaining.
1,"An unexpectedly entertaining slice of old-fashioned swashbuckle, the kind of sweeping, periodically absurd picture that was cranked out on an assembly line in the 1940s."
1,"This is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee, and it still is."
0,"The classic book had a lot of complex, smart things to say about revenge. The movie doesn't."
0,"There's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy, and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side."
1,Old-form moviemaking at its best.
1,"All in all, it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own."
1,"Reynolds' remake brings nothing new to the table, but it's still an enjoyable throwback to the swashbucklers of old."
1,"Dumas's classic tale is such a rattling good yarn, there's nothing you can do to derail it as it hurtles down the track."
0,"A big, vacuous, sometimes exciting glamour-puss of a movie."
0,"A preposterous, expansive and self-conscious attempt to resurrect the historical spectacular."
0,There's more plot and inventiveness in the average 'N Sync music video than in Eric Aronson and Paul Stanton's sweet nothing of a script and antiseptic direction by Eric Bross.
0,"Like all trifles that use unbearable amounts of saccharine to cover up poor quality, this one leaves a bad aftertaste."
0,"On a whole, the movie stays as blandly inoffensive (albeit sometimes annoying) as possible."
1,At least it isn't as condescending or transparently synthetic as most niche-marketed daydreams for the high-school and junior-high set.
0,It doesn't provide enough drama or comedy or romance to make it appeal to anyone other than the 'N Sync faithful.
0,"A romantic comedy that's thinner than a copy of Bop magazine and proves, once again -- see Carey, Mariah -- that the transition from pop star to thespian is no easy leap to make."
0,The lack of resonant or even interesting characters is matched by the toothless script and lifeless direction.
0,"Downright torture for adults, it may prove too unsophisticated even for its preteen target audience."
0,There is plenty that is dreadful about On the Line ... but the fact that the movie is not unbearable is reason for parents everywhere to heave a sigh of relief.
1,"Bass has a charming, quiet anxiety that draws you toward him."
1,On the Line knows its target audience very well.
1,"Harmless romantic and musical hijinks abound, and sentimentality prevails."
0,"On the Line tries too hard to be everything to everyone. And as the saying goes, when you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one."
1,"The movie has some clumsy dialogue and awkward turns, but the picture is brisk and likable."
0,"On the Line would like to be Serendipity for the Oxy-and-Skechers set, but it feels more like the worst movie Michael J. Fox never made."
0,"In the end, it's much ado about not very much, certainly not enough to catapult Bass into a film career, but probably enough to satisfy 'N Sync fans."
0,"As teenybopper idol movies go, it's a few steps up from Spice World."
0,More 'it stinks' than 'NSYNC.
0,An agonizingly creaky movie that laboriously plods through a plot so contrived that the only thing real about it is its length.
1,"Certainly, you could find far more unpleasant ways to while away 85 minutes."
0,Less a romance than a feature-length plug for 'N Sync and its personalities.
0,"An innocuous romantic comedy about missed connections, like Serendipity for people who can't vote yet."
0,
1,A solid network effort about heroism in a most immoral world.
1,"Uprising must be a movie because it makes us feel better about ourselves, when we know perfectly well that we don't deserve to."
0,Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders.
0,Herzog fails to find the visual heart of Zishe's story.
0,It's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks.
0,"Herzog's intentions are clearly noble, but unless you care to wait for the moments when Roth picks up the film and carries it on his back, back off."
1,"Embellished with touches of magic realism and washed in a voluptuous quasi-Wagnernian score, Invincible, when at its best, is almost as seductive as Hanussen's games of smoke and mirrors."
0,It's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen.
1,A tremendous piece of work.
1,"After one gets the feeling that the typical Hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here, it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of Zishe and the fiery presence of Hanussen."
1,"Invincible works, simply but provocatively, as a parable about the oppressed and the oppressors, victimhood and fanaticism."
1,"It's an unusual, thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes."
1,Remarkably accessible and affecting.
1,A strange but oddly memorable film.
1,"Half-baked Herzog, though it has twinkles of theatrical purity that remind you of when his vision was grand."
0,More of a career curio than a major work.
1,"The movie has the power of a great silent film, unafraid of grand gestures and moral absolutes."
0,Feels less like a change in [Herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke.
1,"Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog's works, Invincible shows he's back in form, with an astoundingly rich film."
1,
0,
0,Enough horse-opera clichs to shame the makers of Gunsmoke.
0,"The expensive but soporific Texas Rangers is no Unforgiven, to put it mildly -- in fact, it's more like unforgivable."
0,Plays as if the script pages had been tossed in the air and randomly assembled.
0,That McDermott is second-billed behind prissy Dawson's Creek pretty boy James Van Der Beek tells you a little about how long this thing has been in the editing booth.
0,A dull show.
0,"A soggy oater that gives the genre a bad rep, the Dimension Films dud combines anesthetized writing, uncertain direction and an out-of-its-depth cast of unmistakably urban cowboys for brain-draining effect."
0,"Although it's not the worst western ever made (The Terror of Tiny Town will forever hold that title), it is one of the most mediocre, falling prey to more cliches than you can shake a six-gun at."
0,All hat and no cattle.
0,"Wish it had a few other things, you know, like an adult sensibility, a closer allegiance to the truth, and maybe a little concern for how the English of 1875 was spoken."
0,"The end result may not be a full-blown disaster, but it comes close."
0,This is one bland and cheesy Tex-Mex burrito of a movie.
0,As dull as its title.
0,
0,A documentary on baseball's Texas Rangers and their last-place season would have been more interesting.
0,"Large cast is uniformly fine with tongue-twisting, pulpy dialogue, though pic presents only brief flashes of what look to be fully realized characterizations jettisoned at some point during production or post."
1,A fine cast and production.
1,"All the players (including Hugh Bonneville as the student Bayley) are ardent, all the camera work thoughtful."
1,"Despite the sad denouement, it's still the love story of the year."
1,"Judi Dench and Kate Winslet ... [give] terrific performances as Murdoch's older and younger selves, albeit in severely undernourished parts."
0,"Rarely does a movie feel as leaden-footed as Iris, especially when it tries to bounce back and forth."
1,"Dench once again confirms her gifts as one of the world's great actresses, but Broadbent ... is in some ways more impressive as Bayley."
1,"It's not only that Murdoch and Bayley had just that kind of kinship over the span of a 40-+ year marriage, it's that the actors manage an identically close and intimate relationship both to each other and to the characters they play."
1,"Dench and Broadbent in their scenes together are a painful and loving duet, creating as moving a portrait of marriage as anything the movies have afforded in recent memory."
1,Dench and Winslet are a riveting matchup.
1,"I think this movie does a wonderful job of going back and forth. We see Kate Winslet, who does a terrific job. Judi Dench is excellent."
1,Dench and Winslet inhabit the role of Iris with such intensity it's hard to take your eyes off them.
1,"Intimate, frank and shattering without being maudlin or sudsy."
1,Kate Winslet as the younger Iris Murdoch and Judi Dench as the older version manage to bring the literary lioness to vibrant life.
0,"It leaves out huge gaps of Murdoch's life -- the whole center of it really, when she published all of her important books."
1,"To judge by the result, which is gripping, the film-makers foresaw all the difficulties."
1,"Iris sounds as if it would be painful to watch, and in scenes like the one described above, it can be. Yet watching love realistically depicted onscreen remains the greatest joy of film, and its most important gift to the world."
1,A must-see canticle to married love.
1,Demonstrates the catastrophe of disintegration by putting us first in the full thrall of the character's intellect.
1,"It's good, but not great -- despite the heights to which Dench and Broadbent drive it. But those heights are lofty, the pain still stings."
1,"It's an exemplary lesson in Acting 101, taught by Judi Dench (Iris) and Jim Broadbent (John Bayley, her loyal husband of 40 years)."
1,"There are not two, but four sterling performances here."
1,"Not just a fitting document of a life brilliantly lived but a vibrant, almost palpitating piece of cinema."
1,...intrigues and devastates.
1,The performances are the raison d'etre...
1,"Because the performances are so powerful, one nearly forgets that in its vaulting between the '50s and '90s, Iris is a story with a beginning and end but without a middle."
1,"A magnificent story about the enduring bond between two eccentric, astounding souls who somehow managed to find each other and hold on for dear life."
1,Those who have had a loved one fall prey to the mental ravages of Alzheimer's will see in Iris a depiction that is so lucid and accurate that it may be painful to observe.
1,"As the story of heroic response to tragic illness, Iris is the kind of film often cynically pegged a 'disease of the week' movie. But unlike such formulaic TV productions, Iris' heroine is denied the capacity to be inspiring."
1,Tune out the hype for countless other movies. This is the one to see.
1,"The performances in Iris -- by Judi Dench as the older Murdoch and Jim Broadbent as her husband, John Bayley, and by Kate Winslet as the younger Murdoch -- are so good that the film is completely compelling."
1,"...the results are tender, unflinching, raw and wonderful."
0,"Because the film is well-acted and written with intelligence, it might be worth seeing, despite my objections."
1,"Iris glows with rightness and convinces us we're sharing its characters' understanding that when the books and the memory go, love can remain."
0,"For a movie whose subject is the decline and fall of a towering intellect, there's precious little to think about here."
1,"The impoverished story keeps Iris from achieving greatness, but no qualifiers are needed for the acting."
1,"[The] performances, if nothing else, embody a standard of excellence that Iris Murdoch herself would surely have cheered."
1,... a well-done docudrama starring James Franco from Freaks and Geeks...
1,"It's a hushed project that finds its grandeur in the cinematic approach from director of photography Robbie Greenberg, who gives pic the look of a bigscreen rather than a television project."
1,"For Freaks & Geeks' James Franco, James Dean is a major breakthrough. He not only looks like him, but his mannerisms and his whole persona are startlingly real. This movie rests on his thin, hunched shoulders, and he carries it off."
1,"The movie itself is rarely adventurous, but it could prompt viewers to watch the actual Dean performances again. Credit for that would go mainly to Franco, who excels at playing this odd, conflicted figure."
1,"Franco's metamorphosis into Dean ranks as one of the great TV performances of the year. And it would have been enough to earn James Dean a rave, but it's only one of several performances that set this movie apart."
1,"Sick of movie-star biopics? Then there's little to change your mind in this one... It's worth seeing, though, because James Franco uncannily channels the sulky, sexy, short-lived heartthrob."
1,"Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man."
1,"Re-creates Dean's life and times with what might be called stunning adequacy... Franco's performance is easily the best thing in the movie, conveying Dean's essence and angst without ever becoming a mere impersonation."
1,"Even those of us who suspected that Franco had a great performance in him couldn't have imagined it would be this great... In his spectacular, heartfelt performance, Franco walks Dean's walk and feels his pain."
0,"Uncomplicated war movie with straight-ahead, MTV-style action mixed with simplistic politics."
0,The exhausting obsession with gizmos and gotchas only accentuates a baffling disinterest in the story's emotional crux.
1,Provides about as intense an immersion in military ambience as a Hollywood movie could hope to provide in just over 90 minutes.
1,"A video and commercial maker as well as a military-hardware buff, Moore knows how to mount a visual assault."
0,It sent two of America's most watchable actors -- veteran Gene Hackman and Dallas native Owen Wilson -- to war without a script.
1,"A sleek, slick war movie that works as an adrenaline-pumping action ride and as a great recruitment ad for the U.S. Navy."
1,"The premise is familiar and the storyline formulaic, yet the execution is effective enough that it keeps us involved for the running length."
0,"As steel-toed, tin-eared, flat-footed, jingoistic military thrillers go, Behind Enemy Lines marches in formation, clomping down familiar roads."
0,"Moore, just up from television commercials, relies too heavily on a pastiche of stylistic elements cribbed from others."
0,All those arguments about how desensitizing video games are certainly apply here.
0,"An implausible military technology adventure that takes about 10 minutes to get started, then climaxes for an hour-and-a-half."
0,"The Bosnian War becomes a video game, Gene Hackman turns into a pseudo-John Wayne, and Owen Wilson and Vladimir Mashkov impersonate The Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote."
1,"It is loud. It is formulaic. It's also, more often than not, a thumping good time at the movies."
0,"Pro forma stuff, so much so that you start to wonder why no fetching femme resistance fighter materializes to help the Americans on the ground."
1,"This baby comes equipped with all the bells and missiles. Given the standard-issue plot, it's about all it can be."
0,The pop-soundtrack bombast of the too-infrequently somber Behind Enemy Lines ... sometimes reduces a mediocre pursuit movie with capable action to 'Rockin' Bosnia.'
0,"Directed by first-timer John Moore on the strength of his work on a Sega game ad, which may tell you everything you need to know about its visual sense and narrative nonsense."
0,"Put into the context of a real world at war, the movie seems impossibly shallow."
0,"'Oh no, what will happen to Tom Cruise!' -- that might have worked. 'Oh no, what will happen to Owen Wilson!' just doesn't cut it."
0,"If you're looking for anything beyond flashy entertainment, Behind Enemy Lines feels out of whack from the start."
1,Has first-rate action and a lot of it.
1,"A slickly entertaining war movie that's sometimes striking, sometimes silly -- but never, ever boring."
0,Politics bad. Boom boom good.
1,"A highly competent, if inflated, action flick that offers us war from every vantage."
1,An involving and driving action-packed movie.
0,"Its hero is so reckless and its villains so incompetent that it's a showdown between a man begging to be shot, and an enemy that can't hit the side of a Bos-nian barn."
0,It's no more than recruiting-poster deep.
0,A piece of junk.
0,"The only thing certain about Behind Enemy Lines is that Mr. Wilson is in it for the chance to work with Mr. Hackman, and Mr. Hackman is in it for the money."
1,"An old-fashioned game of the cinematic cat-and-mouse, soldier-on-the-run variety."
1,"With one taut action scene after another, as long as you leave your brain at the door, this is an a glibly entertaining ride."
0,"The filmmakers do their best to distract us, but eventually it becomes hard to ignore that Behind Enemy Lines is one long chase sequence."
0,
0,An uneven and sometimes inappropriate mix of entertainment gambits.
0,"A jumbled, rhythmless, terminally silly lame-o-rama."
0,"A tiresome, repetitive film that is in no way going to hold up to repeated viewings, neither for kids who think flatulence is hilarious nor young adults desperately seeking camp."
1,"A knowing, funny big-screen version that's more entertaining than you might expect."
0,The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes.
1,It's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice.
0,Ruh-roh! Romething's really wrong with this ricture!
1,"The movie Scooby is a delight -- by turns lovable, charming, conspiratorial and snooty."
0,Comes off as a harmless but limp vehicle for a lot of product tie-ins.
0,"It's like an amalgam of Ghostbusters, Alien and the Pokemon movies -- - all the good parts."
1,"Although Scooby-Doo falls far short of becoming the Blazing Saddles of Generations X, Y and Z, it is hard to resist in its moronic charms."
0,"Not that the TV show was so riveting, but most of the half-hour plots were more compelling than this lackluster warmover."
1,"Lillard gives the flick its manic energy, and the rest of the gang holds its own."
0,Throws scraps to different audience constituencies and ends up with a muddle.
0,"Do you really want to spend money watching what is essentially marginality, or would those dollars be better used to see a better film or even buy a good book?"
1,"Any thinking, reasoning human being with an appreciation for cinema would reject it as the vilest trash. Needless to say, it cracked me up the whole way."
0,Get out your pooper-scoopers.
1,"By embracing the original series' tacky elements and inserting just enough self-mockery to avoid smugness, the movie manages to fulfill basic expectations."
0,"The obnoxious special effects, the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant, so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy, dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm."
0,This excruciating adaptation of the innocuous '70s cartoon show makes the film version of Josie and the Pussycats look sophisticated by comparison.
0,Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were.
0,"A frenetic, cluttered $100-million worth of haphazard plotting, fart jokes, computer-generated monsters and visual chaos."
1,It may ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised Scooby-Doo shows or reruns.
0,"I feel no sympathy with any of the characters, I am unable to judge whether the live action movie is a better idea than the all-cartoon TV approach, I am unable to generate the slightest interest in the plot, and I laughed not a single time."
1,"The novelty of seeing these characters on the big screen is occasionally fun, but this Scooby-Doo is no Great Dane."
1,"As this movie knows what it is, Scooby-Doo's a relatively painless 85 minutes."
1,"Much funnier than it has any right to be, and filled with just enough inside jokes to please longtime fans of the cartoon franchise."
0,"The movie drags, and the occasional bursts of mirth and self-referential humor can't save it from bogging down."
0,"The acting is stiff, the story lacks all trace of wit, the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year."
0,The film's effects just don't do the concept justice.
1,Scooby-Doo knows when to take itself seriously and when to laugh at itself -- even if its audience isn't laughing along at every gag.
0,"Watching Ms. Spears sing, dance and act can leave you wondering what is meant nowadays by the concept of talent."
0,One of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears.
0,Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial.
0,"Non-Spears fans will remain unmoved and may actually bolt for the exits upon hearing the opening lines to 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.'"
0,"To paraphrase Oscar Wilde or someone equally irked by melodrama, you'd have to have a heart of stone to watch a film like Crossroads without laughing."
0,The entire 88 minutes of the film translates to a little more than advertisement for Spears' music and endorsements.
1,"Clichs pile up in Crossroads, but it's harmless, powder-puff fun."
0,It does wonders to a critic to know that you could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come.
0,"Not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney."
0,"Oops, she's really done it this time. That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel."
0,"For anyone seeking a movie that captures the utter vapidity of the Britney Spears Experience, with all of her most annoying personal traits and uh-uh-uh vocal tics brought to the fore."
0,"An example of shamelessly bad screenwriting, laden with coincidence and clich and empty characterizations."
0,"It cultivates not the illusion of wholesomeness, since no one's buying it, but the pretense of it. Yet examine the movie's message, and it's pretty insidious."
0,The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it's at least watchable.
0,"So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney won't do it one more time, as far as movies are concerned."
0,"[Spears'] persona has been shamelessly worked into a thin fiction by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes, under the characterless direction of Tamra Davis."
0,A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted.
0,"We could have expected a little more human being, and a little less product."
0,"Britney Spears' feature debut is curiously low-key and even sad. Yes, it pulls itself together occasionally for a musical number, but even those are so locked into the ""reality"" of the story that they don't break lose into fun."
1,"Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound, the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway."
0,If you're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog.
0,"She's not yet an actress, not quite a singer..."
0,The kind of movie that seems like a very extensive trailer for a music video coming soon to Total Request Live.
1,Davis directs the low-budget production with economy and a lack of surface flashiness that is pleasingly unpretentious.
0,Crossroads adopts such a self-important tone that it's embarrassing.
1,"Spears manages to come across on film as natural, endearing, and extremely likable."
1,"Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can? Do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body? If you answered yes, by all means enjoy The New Guy."
0,Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it. The New Guy is one of them.
0,"In The New Guy, even the bull gets recycled."
0,"The same old lame high school screen comedy garbage, rehashed for a new generation of suckers."
0,This is nothing but familiar territory.
0,Every bad cliche of every bad high school movie finds a home here.
0,A particularly loathsome piece of cultural detritus.
0,There's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again.
0,The film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down.
0,"Lame, haphazard teen comedy."
0,An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years.
0,An occasional one-liner rises to the level of near-wit... Most everything else ranges from routine to heavy-handed.
0,"Uneven, with long sections that are completely unfunny."
0,"A loud, brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy."
1,"The New Guy does have a heart. Now, if it only had a brain."
0,"It makes little sense, fails as often as it succeeds, and yet is not hateful and is sometimes quite cheerfully original."
1,"Qualls moves his marionette body around with a true clown's effervescence, and he does rubber-faced parodies of youth cool that are just what youth cool deserves."
0,[L]ame and unnecessary.
0,So wrongheaded that this one couldn't even have looked good on paper.
0,"This is a truly awful movie, made from one of the worst scripts in memory. The New Guy has been on the shelf for more than a year, and it's clear the reason for the long wait wasn't perfectionism. More likely, it was embarrassment."
0,Don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle.
0,Could the release of this dire film mark the moment at which we all fall spectacularly out of love with the American high-school teen comedy?
0,Never gets on the good foot.
0,"It isn't very good, but it doesn't seem to care, which turns out to be rather refreshing."
0,
0,"Distinguished by certain rodent-like features, Qualls is a bargain-basement, pre-adult version of David Spade -- and becomes just as tiresome."
0,A comedy just funny enough to make viewers wish it were far funnier.
0,Lyle Lovett plays the hero's dad: money must be tight. DJ Qualls: aiming at the dumb and dumber crowd.
1,Conspiracy stands on its own as a fly-on-the-wall glimpse of a disturbing piece of history.
1,... Loring Mandel has written a script that's scary in its understatement and Frank Pierson has directed a television movie that's even scarier because it might just as well have been a board meeting of investment bankers...
1,"The result of a meeting is only as good as the parties present, their aims and their wills. Wannsee was not where the Holocaust's if became when but, rather, where when became how soon."
1,"The script of Conspiracy is flat and matter-of-fact, creviced by deep silences as middle management stare into the chasm that has opened at their feet."
0,"The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine.' But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless."
1,"While clever and fast-paced, a truncated ending makes this feel like a film that suffers perhaps from postproduction tweaking."
0,The worst thing about this very bad movie is the opportunity squandered ...
0,... the movie's climax is so under-explained and conveniently resolved that it leaves you feeling as if you've missed a few hundred millennia.
1,[E]ntertaining though hardly profound...
0,"This uninviting and pallid version, starring Guy Pearce, is intent on grinding all the sharp edges off the original story, in effect making the movie childproof, so no one can get hurt touching it."
0,"If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way."
0,... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs.
0,"Seems more like the next Star Trek movie, with Patrick Stewart doing the time warp."
0,"The urgency is gone, replaced by much high-toned silliness, especially when Jeremy Irons shows up."
0,Amazingly stilted before accelerating into its exciting finish.
0,The film is weirdly disjointed and uncertain as to tone.
0,"Simon Wells, whose other films include the animated The Prince of Egypt and Balto, manages to gut all the gee-whiz from the practically foolproof time-travel genre -- despite being H.G.'s real-life great-grandson."
0,"Midway through the movie, just when it seems that it might amount to something interesting, we're suddenly transported to the set of a very bad remake of Planet Of The Apes."
0,"... unlike the shiny machine at its center, its timing is off, and it never quite soars."
0,"... there's something wrong with a time-travel movie that allows an audience's interest to drift so that we have time to worry over where he's parked, and whether he remembered to take his key."
1,... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but George Pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs.
0,"The worst news isn't that this Time Machine is lacking in humanity. It's that screenwriter John Logan has been given the job of writing the next Star Trek movie, Nemesis. That is bad news for the Enterprise gang."
1,"Not exactly H.G. Wells, but sturdy and effective."
0,"Everything else that the filmmakers have done in their thoughtless, lazy way to 'improve' the original formula serves only to leach the drama and excitement out of the underlying story."
0,"The Time Machine isn't so much an adaptation of H.G. Wells' seminal novel as it is an appropriation. The film borrows liberally from the book, but doesn't treat it with much respect or affection or even understanding."
0,The Time Machine is stupid -- too stupid for the impressive special effects or the competently directed action sequences to wash away the bitter taste.
1,"The far future may be awesome to consider, but from period detail to matters of the heart, this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past."
0,"Watchable if never exciting, competent yet hardly exceptional, the picture is content to assume its innocuous position in the cinematic landscape."
1,It will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days.
0,"Bears resemblance to, and shares the weaknesses of, too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences."
0,"The Time Machine is a witless recycling of the H.G. Wells story from 1895, with the absurdity intact but the wonderment missing."
0,"The truth is that Wells wasn't that penetrating a writer when it came to probing character or the human heart. His speculations and gimmicks were what propelled his books. The film, given the chance to deepen its source, instead falls back on its gadgets."
0,They gave The Time Machine a major overhaul and ended up with a clunker.
0,"If it's remembered at all, it will be as a time capsule of early-21st-century blockbuster cowardice and redundancy."
0,Wells' movie is more content to rip off Tomb Raider than remain faithful to his great-grandfather's book.
0,"One of those staggeringly well-produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily."
0,"If H.G. Wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version, what would he say? 'It looks good, Sonny, but you missed the point.'"
0,"Although it gets off to a decent start, this ""Time Machine"" breaks down when it gets to the distant future, which in this case isn't a good place to be stranded."
1,"Solid, lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts."
1,"An unapologetically emotional film that doesn't make you gag, one that manages to be sentimental without turning into a shameless wallow."
1,"[Quaid] puts on Jim Morris' game face, captures his pitching style and manages somehow to make 'bringing heat' seem sexy."
1,It's hard not to get caught up in this improbable but true follow-your-dream tale.
1,"It's a family movie (rated G, no less) that is actually about family, and one that treats families in a realistic, recognizable way."
1,"Shamelessly manipulative, but it's harder than you might imagine to steel your heart against its sentimental leanings."
1,"Despite failed ambitions and occasional servings of corn, The Rookie manages to be both appealing and true to the game."
1,"The film goes beyond being just another sappy, come-from-behind baseball yarn to score as an easygoing ode to modest, forestalled dreams."
1,"So unassuming and pure of heart, you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'Safe!'"
1,"A rarity to be cheered: a smart, engaging family film that stands firmly in the best of the Disney tradition."
1,"Even when there are lulls, the emotions seem authentic, and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time."
0,"It's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic, the wife is patient, the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate, but short enough to make a dream seem possible."
1,It soars with palpable sentiment and spirit.
1,"It's an observant and worthwhile film that, for most of its running time, is a persuasive anatomy of middle-aged disappointment."
1,"The idea is sentimental, but Quaid dries all the sappiness out of it."
1,Such a class act on so many levels that it feels as fresh and stirring as your first-ever baseball flick.
1,"As averse as I usually am to feel-good, follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies, this one got to me."
1,Perfect family entertainment.
1,"As inspirational stories go, this one is top-notch."
1,"When it's not glorifying baseball and Texas myths, The Rookie zips like a good fastball."
1,The embodiment of the very message it so modestly conveys -- it's the accomplished little guy we fervently root for.
1,"Something particularly clean shines in this American fairy tale, a quality of simplicity that's almost as hard to achieve in such movies as a middle-aged man's boyhood dreams."
1,"It is lucky to have Dennis Quaid, who is a fit 47, give an extraordinarily honest and restrained performance as Morris."
0,"The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue, just because it seems obligatory."
1,"A welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic, this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story."
1,"Morris' story was a cinch to become a movie, and Disney does an adequate if somewhat bland job in bringing it to the screen."
1,"I hesitate to use the phrase 'family film' because it has such fluffy connotations, but this is really a rare G-rated movie that's suitable for all viewers."
1,Hancock's heartfelt movie scores a solid hit.
1,"A sports film with feel-happy appeal for all, regardless of age or interest."
1,"What saves it is Dennis Quaid, a fine and generally underrated actor who plays a real-life small-town Texas high-school science teacher and baseball coach who fulfills his dream of pitching in the big leagues."
0,
1,You can see why the filmmakers optioned the story from a Sports Illustrated article: It just works.
1,It's hard to resist the movie's whimsical charm.
1,John Lee Hancock handles this Disney production with at least some taste and skill.
1,"If they gave an Oscar for Best Performance in a Mediocre Movie, Dennis Quaid should already be clearing his mantelpiece."
1,"All the uplift could easily get cloying, but director John Lee Hancock knows how to keep things in control, and the whole is surprisingly satisfying."
1,Deftly constructed to stoke the baseball-phenom fantasies of coulda-shoulda-woulda middle-aged guys and fields-of-dreaming young diamond studs.
1,"It's Quaid and his fellow actors, Rachel Griffiths and Brian Cox, who lift the film out of its intermittent doldrums, and together they deliver that rare thing: a nuanced sports movie."
1,"Until The Rookie came along, I'd forgotten how good and smart a family film can be."
1,"At two-+ hours, The Rookie is a good 20 minutes too long, but for father-son teams waiting eagerly for the umpire's ""Play ball!"", it's an uplifting season opener."
1,"Morris ultimately lasted two partial seasons in the majors, and the film's rendering of his minor-league struggle is so enjoyable you want to see more of that and less of the everyday life preceding it."
1,"Though Hancock traffics in a lot of bogus small-town sentiment, The Rookie exhibits a refreshingly honest understanding of baseball as a job, with long road trips away from home and a workmanlike routine."

0,"Under the routine direction of Tom Dey, Showtime looks like any cop movie made during the past decade."
0,"It's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood isn't laughing with us, folks. It's laughing at us."
0,The film is nothing more than a re-hash of other individual Murphy and De Niro outings.
0,... a lead-balloon caper ...
0,"So pleased with its own spoofy conceit it stays in annoyingly self-amused, predictable mode."
0,It's not so much the generally preposterous premise as it is its sloppy handling that completely unhinges the film.
0,... Showtime isn't much of a show at all.
0,You know you've entered flat dramatic terrain when William Shatner towers over it.
1,[U]neven but frequently engaging comedy ...
1,It's definitely a hate-yourself-in- the-morning glut.
0,"If anyone ever needed a demonstration of what happens to actors when that ventriloquist known as the screenwriter is missing in action, this is it."
0,"De Niro looks bored, Murphy recycles Murphy, and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal."
0,"Showtime's complete lack of originality oozes off the screen like, um, rancid popcorn butter."
0,The results are hit and miss and miss again.
0,Everyone involved should be arrested.
0,"[N]o matter how much good will the actors generate, Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness."
0,"Without a heavy dose of self-reflexive irony, the film's ample use of cliches don't come across as clever -- they're just cliches."
0,... most of Showtime is a layering of tired pop-culture tropes by actors who are not especially interested in what they're doing.
1,"Between them, De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season."
0,"So how many exes and children does Robert De Niro have to support, anyway? It's one of the things you could think about while enduring the abysmal Showtime ..."
0,"It's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie, trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness."
0,Showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment. Those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves. But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro.
0,The movie's funny in the opening scenes and then forgets why it came to play.
0,[P]artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting. The catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders.
1,This movie understands exactly how much we'd like to hang out with De Niro and Murphy.
0,"Sloppy, half-baked mess."
1,Showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation.
0,"A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director, Tom Dey, had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours (and, for that matter, Shrek)."
0,"Showtime isn't particularly assaultive, but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase, explosion or gunfight again."
0,"90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay, screeching-metal smashups, and flaccid odd-couple sniping."
0,This has the feel of something that was written by committee and it's all been done before.
0,There's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits.
0,The thinness of the conception gives the actors so little room to maneuver that they turn in uniformly one-note performances.
1,A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem.
0,"The movie lacks the energizing force that Jonze, a producer on this film, gave Malkovich."
0,"An overemphatic, would-be wacky, ultimately tedious sex farce."
1,"This is an aggressive mix of smart and stupid, a high-concept goof that swings with abandon and makes enough contact to keep you smiling."
0,A sporadically amusing mess of good intentions and bad execution.
0,"The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously, but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students."
0,A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire.
0,I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again.
1,"The results, if not memorable, are at least interesting."
1,"What lingers is Arquette and her wistful little squeak of a voice, imbuing Lila with a mournfulness that's quite touching."
1,A satisfying and original picture.
1,"The funniest movie I've seen so far this year (which is saying almost nothing), but it has an air of pale, forced outrageousness about it."
0,"Human Nature is a goofball movie, in the way that Malkovich was, but it tries too hard."
1,A treat for aficionados of oddball movies.
0,Remains more of a riff than an actual movie.
1,"Give this one a try, if for no other reason than to convince Hollywood that 'something different' doesn't automatically mean throwing away good money."
0,"It's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness, and where Human Nature should be ingratiating, it's just grating."
1,Enjoyably off-kilter and generously seasoned with laugh-out-loud moments.
1,"If it tried to do anything more, it would fail and perhaps explode, but at this level of manic whimsy, it is just about right."
0,This time Kaufman's imagination has failed him.
0,"Human Nature should have been more polished, and less tame."
0,"All the way to the middle of the movie, and maybe beyond that, it's impossible to get the script's drift. That's frustrating if not outright defeating."
0,"It's way out there, but not effective enough."
0,"It's all squeamishly pathetic in a freaked-out way, as the actors are reduced to primates and the movie makes no sense at all."
1,The simplicity with which it depicts these [animal] forces eternally at war with each other is sometimes sublimely evocative.
0,"For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative, the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale."
0,Tries for both civilized wit and primitive joy -- and mostly misses both.
0,
0,Bullock ... seems to have nothing deeper in mind than doing a sappy big-screen version of TV's CSI.
0,"There are things to like about Murder By Numbers -- but, in the end, the disparate elements don't gel."
1,An unpleasant though sometimes effective psychological thriller that is noteworthy for being the film in which actress Sandra Bullock has gotten her act back together.
0,You might think that people dumb enough to make a by-the-numbers movie about a murder would at least be smart enough not to call it Murder By Numbers.
0,"When Bullock is on screen, Murder by Numbers is as far away as a sleepwalker's gaze. But when Schroeder focuses on the teenagers, the film is wide awake, eye-to-eye with adolescent angst and anomie."
0,Follows well-worn paths of the cops-and-psycho-killer routine.
1,"Though [Schroeder] makes you squirm more than you want to at the inevitable scenes of the trussed-up female murder victim, he also has the proclivity and the skill to make at least the B-picture half of 'Murder by Numbers' of more than passing interest."
1,Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt make a truly sinister pair of culprits.
0,"Schroeder is sometimes able to disguise his contempt for the material and elevate it into something serviceable (like Single White Female). In Murder by Numbers, though, even Schroeder can't keep his own boredom from showing."
0,Mediocre.
1,Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting.
1,"Murder by Numbers' isn't a great movie, but it's a perfectly acceptable widget."
0,[Gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience.
0,There's nothing really wrong with Murder by Numbers -- it's just that you've seen it all before.
0,"A respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details, but ultimately weak in its impact."
0,A preposterously dull thriller.
0,Doesn't add up to much.
1,"This is Sandra Bullock at her teasing, wonder woman best."
0,This should've been called Moviemaking by the Numbers. That would be a truthful description.
1,Murder by Numbers gives Sandra Bullock her best role in recent memory.
0,Fans of CSI and Patricia Cornwell novels are not likely to find Murder by Numbers any more convincing than the Simpson jury found blood tracings.
0,Murder By Numbers plays like two separate movies awkwardly joined together.
0,"At 118 minutes, the running time allows for too much dawdling and not enough legitimate tension."
1,"For much of its length, the film is plausible, if predictable and ponderous. Its strongest assets are its actors."
1,A mixed bag.
0,What's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour. Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough.
1,Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability.
1,"After an uncertain start, Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullock's memorable first interrogation of Gosling."
0,"Bullock is good, the script is not."
1,"As long as Schroeder stays with the kids, the film musters a good deal of restless tabloid intensity, and even the occasional twinge of pathos."
1,It's well worth catching for its interesting twists on the Leopold and Loeb story.
0,"It's an intriguing set-up, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired."
1,"The outline of Murder by Numbers may be familiar, but the filmmakers and Bullock do an expert job of filling in the colors."
1,It's a ripping yarn that recalls such early Hitchcock classics as The Secret Agent and The Man Who Knew Too Much.
1,"Jagger, Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride."
1,Reasonably fun to watch.
0,"The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject, combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat, plodding picture."
1,A clever blend of fact and fiction.
1,"Visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down, examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen, and keeps you guessing from first frame to last."
1,"Even with all its botches, Enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment."
1,It is Scott's acting -- and that of the lustrous Kate Winslet -- that almost makes sense of a hare-brained movie.
1,What I like about the movie is its combination of suspense and intelligence.
1,"Unlike so many recent films set during WWII, it makes history exciting without dumbly distorting or misrepresenting it."
1,"Flaws aside, Enigma is engaging and ambitious."
0,"Enigma is well-made, but it's just too dry and too placid."
0,"A turgid muddle of romance, espionage, and geek valor."
1,"With an unorthodox, at least by Hollywood standards, heroine (brains trump beauty!) and an adventure with the highest stakes imaginable (math prodigy saves the free world!), the oddball allure of Enigma is no mystery."
1,"Dense, in some cases as encrypted as the cipher that is its subject, it's nevertheless worth the careful scrutiny it demands."
1,"The smart, elegant Enigma won't win any prizes for snappiness or simplicity -- but it's a pleasure to see a film that aspires to something else."
0,How did a movie with so many gifted people in front of and behind the camera wind up being such a drag?
0,"It merely plods, occasionally bogging down in explanations and never generating much excitement."
0,"Complex, sinuously plotted and, somehow, off-puttingly cold."
1,"If the movie's plot is a rare combination of impenetrable and inconsequential, it has been laid out compellingly by director Michael Apted."
0,"Ultimately, clarity matters, both in breaking codes and making movies. Enigma lacks it."
1,"Pay attention, guess where it's going, and find yourself surprised."
0,Apted and Stoppard have bitten off too much as they attempt to juggle an espionage plot and parallel past/present romances.
1,"At its frequent best, Enigma slyly evokes the spirit of classic Alfred Hitchcock thrillers."
1,"For most of it's 117 minutes, Enigma delivers a powerful story from World War II that's based on real events."
1,"Enigma is anything but enigmatic about affairs of the heart, and is well worth seeing for its elective affinities alone."
1,Apted and his crew pull out all the stops to craft a thriller out of material that looks better on paper than it does on film.
1,"The combined talents of Apted, Stoppard and the stellar cast make Enigma a puzzle worth solving."
1,"It arrives with an impeccable pedigree, mongrel pep, and almost indecipherable plot complications."
1,"Not enigmatically at all, it pleases and teases us -- in high style."
1,A complicated and intelligent British film with a curious roster of off-screen talent.
1,"Overall, it's a very entertaining, thought-provoking film with a simple message: God is love."
0,"Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists, who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic."
1,"It's a persuasive spiritual journey, sentimental at times but never hopelessly cloying."
1,
1,"An inventive, black comedy."
0,The audience has cried 'enough' long before the heroine does.
0,A jarring thriller packed to the gills with cheap shocks.
0,"Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society, but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama."
0,The movie does some traveling of its own: from sort of stupid to simply ludicrous.
1,"We root for [Lopez], fear for her and eagerly await her transformation into something like The Equalizer."
1,"It's his brazenness -- and Campbell's utterly creepy performance -- that keeps the story revved up, even when you feel it's being spelled out for you in Crayola."
0,"This is a by-the-numbers thriller that doesn't even succeed on the most basic, visceral level."
0,It's really a bogeyman horror film in sociological drag -- I Know You Married an Abusive Creep Last Summer.
0,"At best, this should have been a bad made-for-TV movie."
0,"In terms of actual social conscience, the movie gets a demagogic, rabble-rousing F."
1,"Apted has paced Enough with the required amount of snap, keeping the whammies coming at regular and increasingly terrifying intervals."
0,"The picture should really have been titled Uncle, because that's what many men will feel like crying out after enduring this estrogen-fuelled freakout."
0,"If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, Enough just added another lane."
1,"It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now -- in the best way, it's almost unbearable."
0,It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept.
0,You expect more from director Michael Apted (Enigma) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (Reversal of Fortune) than this cliche pileup.
0,The film is flat.
0,"When it comes to making bad movies, for Lopez, Enough is enough."
0,Rivals Showgirls and old Ed Wood movies from the 1950s in the so-bad-it's-fun category.
0,"As gaudy and manipulative entertainments go, there's just not enough in Enough."
0,"What begins as a seemingly brainless, bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and, by film's end, a feminist action fantasy."
0,You wonder why Enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie.
0,A nasty item masquerading as a feminist revenge picture.
0,"Shamelessly exploits the horror of domestic violence for melodramatic, cheap thrills."
0,"Dotted with the 'Oh, please!' moments of grotesque implausibility you get when cynical, shameless filmmakers ... feel contempt for their audience."
0,The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone.
0,"Definitely a crowd-pleaser, but then, so was the Roman Colosseum."
0,"Clumsy, obvious, preposterous, the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades."
0,"Works as long as it faces the horror of extreme male privilege, but dissipates quickly once Lopez begins over-preparing for a face-off with hand-to-hand combat training and calibrated techno-gadgetry."
0,"Enough trivializes an important crisis, reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment."
0,"It's a loathsome movie, it really is and it makes absolutely no sense."
0,"Despite a story that starts off convincingly, this movie turns into melodramatic, revenge-crazy Hollywood mush."
0,The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise.
0,"Lopez is the sort who does little except pose, with lip gloss highlighting her uninteresting face."
1,"Thoughtful, gripping and steeped in action that defines character."
1,Allows us to hope that Nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker.
1,"Insomnia is based on a 1997 Norwegian film, and though there are some key plot differences, the elements that made the original so memorable remain."
1,Intensely sharp-witted remake of the noir thriller Insomnia.
1,It proves that both Al Pacino and Robin Williams really can act without overacting. It also shows that director Christopher Nolan has a life after Memento.
1,"Nolan has proved that he's as adept with a straightforward and well-plotted thriller as he is with a idiosyncratic, ingenious one."
1,The acting alone is worth the price of admission.
1,Proves the best (read: most unsettling) of its type since The Pledge.
1,"A deftly entertaining film, smartly played and smartly directed."
1,"A thriller whose style, structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story, you cannot separate them."
0,"You see Robin Williams and psycho killer, and you think, hmmmmm. You see the movie and you think, zzzzzzzzz."
1,This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise: Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams.
1,"Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence, of good guys and bad, and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means."
1,"Pacino, his creased face looking like it's been aged in a smokehouse, is wonderfully bleary as the increasingly confused Dormer."
1,A haunting psychological drama.
1,Here's proof that it's still possible to make pop-oriented yet personal movies with an A-list cast and a zillion bucks.
1,"With Insomnia, his third feature, Nolan, 32, has proven himself a precocious master of the thriller."
1,That rare instance where Hollywood improves upon a movie from foreign soil.
1,"A four-course gourmet alternative to summer popcorn flicks, serving up the meatiest performances Al Pacino and Robin Williams have given in many years."
1,"Proves the 32-year-old Nolan is the real deal, a gifted storyteller who knows how to use style, mood and composition to illustrate his characters' inner lives along with their actions."
1,"Seitz's script sticks closely to the original, but Nolan has had no trouble using a variety of skills to make the material his own."
1,"Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original, but it doesn't disgrace it, either."
1,It's gripping entertainment in a popular vein -- the police procedural -- that nevertheless follows no preconceived formulas.
1,"When all else is said and done, Insomnia runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino's performance."
1,"[Nolan] is a filmmaker in full control of mood, tone, and pacing, to whom actors as wildly different as Pacino and Williams can entrust their best instincts, rather than their showiest."
1,"Atmospheric and deeply attuned to nuance, Insomnia is a thinking ticket buyer's murder mystery."
1,Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister know how to mix riveting action with psychological drama.
1,"Nolan is a craftsman who joins the ranks of Steven Soderbergh, David O. Russell, Curtis Hanson, and M. Night Shyamalan as an individual voice working within the Hollywood system."
1,"Unlike most remakes, the Nolan Insomnia is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play."
1,It's a psychological thriller with actual thrills and actual psychology.
0,"The best thing about Insomnia is that despite director Christopher Nolan's soft spot for moody-blues obfuscation, he has the good sense to keep his star in practically every shot."
1,"The Hollywood version (which is half an hour longer) transports the action to Alaska, and works up a respectable level of bleary-eyed paranoia."
1,"Insomnia is not my kind of arsenic, but it's so well-made and enigmatic I liked it anyway."
1,It's a crafty story told with more style and gray areas than your average thriller.
1,"Pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived Dormer, his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical."
1,This could this be The Big Sleep for a new generation.
1,"Christopher Nolan's impressive third film, after Following and Memento, deploys the idea of an all-pervasive light to befuddle the deductive process and expose the corruption of the soul."
1,"Despite its linear storyline, the film is very recognisably the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave us Following and Memento."
1,"While it may not be as stylistically idiosyncratic as Memento Insomnia is a gripping, highly dramatic thriller that more than confirms the distinctive talent of young Brit helmer Christopher Nolan."
1,"The film represents a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery. Which is to say that Nolan makes you feel the end-of-the-earth bleakness of his setting, makes you feel the way it can discombobulate people once they internalize it."
1,"With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch, the movie might have tipped too far Pacino's way. But Robin Williams is a shockingly effective counterweight."
1,"Scene by scene, screenwriter Hillary Seitz follows director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's original closely, but this remake deepens and improves upon the Norwegian film by giving Dormer a more complex relationship with Eckhart."
0,"Nolan uses visual pyrotechnics to pump up the tension and add to Pacino's sense of disorientation, but the feeling he evokes isn't as forlorn, creepy, or ambiguous as in the original (though the mountain wilderness is just as forbidding)."
1,This one is nowhere near as original -- it's a flawed remake of a fine first feature from Norway -- but Insomnia still stands on its own as a thriller with brains and scenic beauty.
1,"A dark and fidgety picture from Christopher Nolan, who made such a splash with Memento."
1,"As Pacino endures day after day without a wink of sleep, Insomnia skillfully turns the screws, delving further into his troubled mind as it's haunted by past and present sins, as well as deceptive visions that seem to bleed out of his conscience."
1,"The highlight is Pacino, who gives his best performance in years."
1,Insomnia is not so much about the murder mystery as it is about Will's internal struggle with what's right and what's possibly okay.
1,"Opening with some contrived banter, cliches and some loose ends, the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half."
1,"An ambitious movie that, like Shiner's organizing of the big fight, pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off."
0,"It's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable, and Shiner, starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune, is certainly that."
1,"One of the best silly horror movies of recent memory, with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers."
0,Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan.
1,What it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread.
0,"A perfectly acceptable, perfectly bland, competently acted but by no means scary horror movie."
1,"They has a low-budget, generic feel -- but also enough sense to know that unseen menace is a lot creepier than explicit gore."
0,"They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening, afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn. They were right."
0,What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares?
0,"A dull, dumb and derivative horror film."
0,They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering.
0,Represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre.
1,"Efficient, suitably anonymous chiller."
0,The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show.
1,"It's certainly entertaining enough and made with great style, but the whole thing feels slightly undercooked."
1,... more interesting than it ought to be because the always wonderful Jeanne Tripplehorn is directed by the always fidgety John Badham.
1,"USA's Brother's Keeper cleverly plays the emotion and action cards, offering a mix of Silence of the Lambs psychological thrills with CSI gritty detective work."
0,The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller.
0,"Splashes its drama all over the screen, subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured, but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings."
0,"A reasonably efficient mechanism, but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided."
0,Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie.
0,Not really bad so much as distasteful: We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers.
0,"True to its title, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at."
0,There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer. Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame.
0,"Feels like the faceless product of a Hollywood screenwriting computer program, one that provide everything but personality and a brain."
1,"For a good chunk of its running time, Trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller."
1,"A tightly drawn, propulsive thriller."
0,"The movie is a negligible work of manipulation, an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents."
0,Brisk hack job.
0,"A sleazy, exploitative thriller that milks its child-in-danger premise for all it's worth."
0,
0,Luis Mandoki's movie Trapped is one of the most inept hostage thrillers I've ever seen.
1,"Ron Livingston is excellent as Ginsberg, the film's de facto narrator, and Kiefer Sutherland is admirably restrained in the role of Burroughs."
1,"This isn't a retooled genre piece, the tale of a guy and his gun, but an amiably idiosyncratic work."
0,"It's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters, hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes."
1,"An indie that benefits from amusing characters, strong thesping and taut situational humor."
0,"Like life on the island, the movie grows boring despite the scenery."
0,At no point should anyone mistake this for an actual movie. This is an extended beach video that will leave no one swept away.
0,"There is no credible feeling here, no comedy, no eroticism."
0,This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now.
0,"The fact that Swept Away got made at all implies there simply is no dissuading Madonna from her movie-star aspirations. Her tenacity is admirable, but it's also block-headed."
1,Turns out to be not only relevant but entertaining.
0,"As Madonna vehicles go, this one is hardly the worst. But it does show the diva-actress at her most unappealing."
0,"Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still, it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered."
0,No yacht was harmed during shooting. It's the movie that's the shipwreck.
0,The kind of bad movie that only talented people can make.
1,"Sound the trumpets: For the first time since Desperately Seeking Susan, Madonna doesn't suck as an actress."
0,The film turns out to have nothing going for it at all.
0,Staggeringly dreadful romance.
0,Even camp status eludes this tepid and misguided picture.
0,New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is.
1,"Down the line, this movie may become a camp classic. At the moment, it's a stitch."
1,"After a ghastly start, it becomes a curiously affecting document of a director trying to show the world why he loves his wife -- not the changeling pop star, but the actress."
0,"What Madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately, it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing, sometimes all at once."
0,Swept Away's worst crime is that it is butt-numbingly B-O-R-I-N-G.
0,It's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie.
0,It's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay.
0,"For all his fidelity to the Wertmller screenplay, Ritchie has made a movie that is neither as attractive nor as repulsive, and certainly not as funny, as the original."
0,Two of the least likable characters I've seen in a romance in a long time.
0,Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? A cartoon?
0,"A better title, for all concerned, might be Swept Under the Rug."
0,"I wouldn't wish the stupefying dialogue of ""Swept Away"" on any actress, but to watch Madonna flounder through it is more punishment than I can bear."
0,"If there is one thing worse than a Guy Ritchie movie, it's a Guy Ritchie movie with Madonna in it."
0,This waterlogged romantic comedy really does deserve to sink without trace.
0,Both husband and wife seem to be in way over their heads.
0,Every bit the cinematic shipwreck you'd imagine it to be.
0,"The Vera Hruba Ralston of her time, Madonna has persisted in making movies despite all evidence that this is one medium in which no one wants to see or hear her."
1,An often deeply moving depiction of the brittle lives of several inhabitants of the same London housing complex.
1,"If every artist's misfires were this strong, life would be almost too wonderful to bear."
1,Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing.
1,"Amazing how Leigh, using his customary workshop ""development"" technique to let individual actors elaborate characters, fascinates us with the ordinary."
0,"Leigh uses a somber cello-rich score to infuse this quotidian suffering with a mystical edge and high-culture gloss -- and yet, thanks to the generally enthusiastic performing, the movie borders on farce."
1,"[Generosity] seems to resonate in Andrew Dickson's sweet, melancholy score, in Dick Pope's tactfully beautiful images and in every frame of this sad, resolute film."
0,"A tough go, but Leigh's depth and rigor, and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness, offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu."
1,"Leigh isn't breaking new ground, but he knows how a daily grind can kill love."
1,It's easy to succumb to the rhythms of this melancholic but humanistic rumination on the meaning of life.
1,It's so realistic and the performances are so dead on.
1,"Leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of Margaret Thatcher's ruinous legacy, he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other."
0,These characters are beyond hope -- and caring about.
1,"A triumph, a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light."
1,"With one exception, every blighter in this particular South London housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big, comforting jar of Marmite, to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness."
1,"Leigh has created another remarkable work, up there with his best."
0,"Leigh's sympathy for the working poor is unmistakable and unassailable, but the tragic grandeur with which he imbues their pain hovers dangerously close to condescension."
1,"The resolution -- which I won't describe, as it's something to see -- is extremely moving."
1,We're back on the social and emotional turf that Leigh knows best.
1,"Everything you've come to expect, and cherish, in a Mike Leigh movie."
1,These people are real as few movie characters ever are.
0,"Grueling, heavy-handed, and surprisingly insight-free."
1,"The more you think about the movie, the more you will probably like it."
1,"It's a challenging film, one that rewards the committed filmgoer."
1,"The film feels uncomfortably real, its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority."
1,Leigh makes these lives count. And he allows a gawky actor like Spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range.
1,"An unsentimental, but nevertheless touching and sincere, reflection on the meaning of family and the fragility of love."
0,"For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed, mostly inarticulate, hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one."
1,"Mike Leigh goes spelunking in search of the English soul, finds gold."
0,A thriller that never takes the pulse above 60 beats per minute.
1,"Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy, kinky fun."
0,"Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects, not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos."
0,"Pretty amusing when the director apes Hitchcock, and pretty awful when he apes himself."
0,"More tawdry than titillating, what should have been sultry is more often skanky."
1,"Sexy and passably entertaining, with a plot that's too clever by half."
1,"De Palma -- a master of kinky, delirious visuals -- hooks you good."
1,It's the best bad movie out there.
0,"The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is, although it's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates."
0,"De Palma fools around with split screens and slo-mo, but no amount of cinematic artifice can varnish over the fact that this is simply a bad film."
1,"It's a sexy, violent, glamorous, sinfully funny movie with a surface as hard and brilliant as diamonds."
0,The director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff.
1,"Far more absorbing and tantalizing than most of the plodding, overworked thrillers the studios churn out these days."
1,"The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma, but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest, most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years."
0,"When [De Palma's] bad, he's really bad, and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done."
1,"Inventive, fun, intoxicatingly sexy, violent, self-indulgent and maddening."
0,"A uniquely De Palma kind of effluence, an exercise in auteur self-parody."
0,The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career.
0,"The most common audience reaction probably will be, 'Huh?'"
1,"I enjoyed this one because, rather than nitpick the director's usual lapses in logic, I allowed the sexy visuals and sumptuous set design to wash over me."
0,"Maybe all the pieces of a truly good film noir are here, but the filmmaker has opted simply to toss them into the air and let them fall where they may."
1,You don't need to take Femme Fatale seriously in order to derive great pleasure from what De Palma is up to here.
0,"Once, De Palma seemed like a director intoxicated with the possibilities of movies; now he just seems in need of intervention."
1,"This is pure filmmaking, elegant and slippery."
1,"You may loathe [De Palma's] sexual excesses and violent urges, but his images are visual catnip."
0,A feast for hard-core movie or De Palma buffs (and Romijn-Stamos junkies) but a famine for anyone looking for a good story.
0,No normal person should hurt himself trying to follow the thing.
1,Great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood.
0,"At least Femme Fatale has an apt title - ""femme"" because it's about a woman and ""fatale"" because it makes you want to jump out a window."
1,"De Palma has provided enough ripe flesh, split-screen mayhem, and dreamlike imagery to power six films noir."
1,
1,A wonderful ride.
1,I found myself capitulating to its inspired formalist madness -- something I've resisted in [De Palma's] films for the past 30-odd years.
0,The film feels dated both in its message and style.
1,"Noyce's measured, intelligent film ... restores the novel's political and moral complexity."
1,"The Saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence, and The Quiet American brings us right into the center of that world."
1,Not only true to Greene's novel -- it has the effect of making the novel itself seem truer than it has ever been.
1,A towering achievement with a soul-baring performance by Michael Caine that deserves the highest praise.
1,Does a superb job of evoking the psychological world of Graham Greene in which the truth of any situation tends to be hidden and riddled with ambiguities.
1,"A graceful, contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined."
1,"[A] superbly controlled, passionate adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 novel."
1,This is intelligent grown-up entertainment on both a political and a humanistic level.
1,"Strong, haunting and couldn't be more timely."
1,"Highly recommended viewing for its courage, ideas, technical proficiency and great acting."
0,Visually disappointing.
1,"Graham Greene might well have liked the sense of physical and emotional ruin in Caine's slow-moving, heavy-lidded presence."
1,"Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here, with their memorable and resourceful performances."
1,"A full experience, a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence."
1,"It's hard to imagine a tighter, more gripping adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 novel."
1,This version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire.
1,"A fine adaptation despite the slight departures from its source, with warm cinematography that captures the feel of '50s Saigon and two performances worthy of Oscar attention."
1,"Caine creates a portrait of a man torn up by ambivalence, and, in the end, despair, that is just about brilliant."
1,"An instant classic and a dramatic beauty, a film that gets us to the core of Greene's chilly, dark and romantic view of the post-war world."
1,"Noyce has wrought an often-compelling tale of life, love, and jealousy played out under the gathering storm clouds of war."
1,"For Caine, it's a peak performance in a career that has had many of them."
1,It's a political story -- and an uncannily timely one -- yet the politics fade into the background in the wake of Caine's complex and splendid performance.
1,Old-fashioned storytelling in the best sense of the term.
1,This is a smart and literate effort that despite some weaknesses in overall conception has one undeniable virtue: There's not a single weak scene.
1,A fine film anchored by a terrific performance by one of cinema's most accomplished actors.
1,Caine is the center of this film and he's never been more brilliant and less blinding.
1,"This story still seems timely and important. And there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now, with older and wiser eyes, because we know what will happen after Greene's story ends."
1,"A rare Western feature shot in Vietnam, with real locations and sets that look well-worn enough to be real, with wonderful performances."
1,raser has finally made good on his hesitant dramatic turn in Gods and Monsters a few years back.
1,"The narrative is lean, the supporting performances are solid, and, perhaps most crucially, the emotional tone of the piece is spot-on."
1,Caine's imperial world weariness gives the movie a vital potency.
1,"Exceedingly handsome, unapologetically intelligent drama."
1,The result is a rarity on the modern screen -- a film with more brains than heart. Yet that alone makes for a pleasant change.
1,It's Caine who gives the movie depth.
1,"In a seemingly effortless performance, Caine dominates every scene in the film, not by what he does but by what he doesn't do."
1,"Phillip Noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer, Christopher Doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of Greene's prose, and it's there on the screen in their version of The Quiet American."
1,The Quiet American was filmed in Vietnam and does a wonderful job of conveying a sense of place and time.
1,"Noyce has no trouble convincing us he's made a film for our times. Even better, he's done it without upsetting the climate of the place where all Greene's novels are set, regardless of their actual position on the map."
1,"Caine, who also starred in one other Greene adaptation, 1983's The Honorary Consul, is the essence of almost all the author's misfits -- a practiced cynic masking an aching romantic."
1,"[Caine] gives one of his best performances, whether dissembling a new-found inner steel under questioning or breaking down in the privacy of a toilet."
1,"The Quiet American is a lovely little mover, barely breaking into a sweat as it dances its dreadful dance of love and need to the backing tune of political unrest, moral ambiguity and subterfuge."
1,... gallantry is what a remarkable cast brings to the project.
1,Mitigates its gimmicky predictability and de rigueur uplift by resisting the lazy sentimentality of most AIDS dramas.
1,"Hits its target and does it the old-fashioned way, not with didacticism but with a solid story and, for the most part, well-crafted, authentic characters that deepen over the course of the film, giving genuine emotional power to the film's resolutions."
0,A rather crude affair that feels like a student film.
1,Holds together in spite of its flaws.
1,The film's important message is delivered without excessive sentimentality or being overly preachy.
1,Deserves to be given time for the word to get out on just how good it is.
1,"Although, at times, the sluggish action of One Week seems to creep by in real time, the film is kept believable by honest, low-key performances and a script that sounds like the way real people talk."
0,Reyes's script turns a dissection of ambition into Sleeping With the Enemy-style nonsense.
0,"Stereotypical, banally written bloodbath."
1,Leguizamo ... gives one of the best performances of the year in a lead role in an American movie.
0,"A plot this standard might work if driven by interesting acting, but the performances in Empire are flat and contrived."
0,"A witless, unoriginal mishmash of gangsta-drama clichs."
0,Ultimately just one more urban gangland genre flick.
0,"The whole enterprise feels predigested, as there isn't much here we haven't seen done before and done better."
0,Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito's Way.
1,"Between bursts of automatic gunfire, the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism."
0,This movie ... doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is.
0,A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese.
0,"Tries to pass off a scattered, cliched approximation of the real deal."
1,A gangster movie with the capacity to surprise.
0,"Another excuse to trot out the usual ghetto-melodramatic bromides: What Happens When You Leave the Old Neighborhood Behind and Remembering Who Your Real Posse Is and, most of all, Respecting the Woman Who Loves You Best."
0,"The characters ... are paper-thin, and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script."
1,"A standard crime drama enlivened by its sense of time, place and character."
0,"It has the right approach and the right opening premise, but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material."
0,"[Reyes] pushes his shopping cart through the ghetto-drug-flick warehouse, where all the merchandise has been picked over like a Filene's sale rack on the day after Thanksgiving."
0,Leaves no clich unturned; it's Old Jack City.
0,"It winds up moving in many directions as it searches (vainly, I think) for something fresh to say."
0,It's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense.
0,You never believe for a minute that the character actor and comedian from Moulin Rouge and Summer of Sam is actually a once-ruthless drug dealer trying to go straight.
0,A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie.
0,"The movie's action unfolds laboriously before us, dragged along, bumpety-bumpety, by the plodding voiceover that Leguizamo has the misfortune of delivering."
0,This is the most predictable plot twist since The Greatest Story Ever Told. You really know this one is coming and it just ruins the whole movie.
0,A yawningly familiar melodrama about an enterprising hustler who's undone by his own ambitions.
1,"Yes, we're walking those mean streets again. Good thing we're taking a few unanticipated turns."
0,Reyes has obviously seen Goodfellas 50 or 60 times.
1,Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing.
1,Every bit as clever and surprising as Malkovich.
1,"Few scripts toss more challenging balls in the air, and Jonze juggles them all with artful, light-stepping ease. It's magic."
1,"Demonstrates that Kaufman, the real Charlie Kaufman, has a rare and really weird talent not only for finding portals into other people's psyches but also for Silly Puttying his own into the stories he tells."
1,Adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary.
1,"I can't imagine Adaptation having much mainstream appeal, but, for those who look for something genuinely off-the-wall in a motion picture, this will unquestionably strike a nerve."
0,"Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot."
1,The boldest and most imaginative studio film of the year.
1,"What Adaptation nails about writing is the soul-splitting duality of it: The combination of arrogance and neediness, of ego and insecurity, of the writer's lonely inertia with the romantic grandiosity of what they create."
1,"Warped, self-lacerating and giddily hilarious."
0,A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to.
1,A comic gem with some serious sparkles.
1,"Mr. Cage and Mr. Jonze share a casual, daredevil sensibility, and the two of them -- or should I say the three of them? -- pull off one of the most amazing technical stunts in recent film history."
1,Features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever.
1,"Compare Adaptation to Woody Allen's lame Hollywood Ending, and you can see that Kaufman is Allen's true successor-formed by Allen but primed to carry the torch a little farther into the swamp of his own neuroses."
1,It's an amazing piece of work.
1,A daring and gleeful rearrangement of film grammar and a zinging ode to the imagination.
1,"Reverberates on so many levels, comic and cosmic, that it is as trippy fun to think about as it is to watch."
0,Adaptation gets an A for audacity and a Z for Zzzzz...
1,"The most lacerating Hollywood comedy since The Player a decade ago, perfectly capturing the self-absorption of the industry for which it was made."
1,"Almost all of it is funny and provocative in ways many other Hollywood movies, especially the adaptations, can't touch."
1,Adaptation may not be the first movie to examine the creative process. But it's the most playfully brilliant.
1,Adaptation is simply brilliant.
1,Probably the most creative and noncommercial screenplay to be embraced by a Hollywood studio in years.
0,"Gradually the movie's one joke plays out, and Charlie's doubts about inserting himself into his own screenplay prove to be well-founded."
1,"With Adaptation, Kaufman has found an entirely new way of telling a story, belying the old credo that there's nothing left that's new for the movies to show us."
1,It will surprise you. It will delight you. It will give you something truly chewy to take home from the theater.
1,"It's the most original, exhilarating and hilarious movie of the year."
1,"Kaufman's carefully constructed screenplay emphasizes so many layers of duality, it's beyond gimmick. It's a world view."
1,What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is.
1,"This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking."
1,Consider the irony: Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich) wins best screenplay for a movie that's essentially about his failure to write a screenplay. That's worth a gold statuette on its own.
1,One-of-a-kind near-masterpiece.
0,"Mired in the inertia of Charlie's writer's block, as if the real Kaufman never found his own passion for the material."
1,"Few recent movies have conveyed so forcefully how people can feel shut out by their own lack of passion, how they yearn to end the emptiness."
1,Charlie Kaufman is a genius.
1,"Both Kaufmans are played by Nicolas Cage, whose goofy, moon-faced sincerity has never been put to funnier use."
1,"Cage gives one of the best performances of his recent career as the Kaufmans. He's a natural in this role, especially when that great horse face breaks into an ingratiating grin..."
1,"It's the sort of movie that keeps reinventing itself and nudging us in the ribs as it does. You'll want to see it soon, because everyone you know will be talking about it."
1,For two-thirds of its running time the film is close to genius. But there's still no third act.
1,"In the wrong hands, the lunacy could have gotten out of control, but Jonze has near-perfect pitch. He never forces the farce, rooting even Kaufman's wildest digressions in real emotions."
0,"A film substantially lacking in personality, energy, magic and humor."
0,"Lethal for kids and an unspeakable insult to adults, this unreleasable fiasco is a torture for all."
0,"As the wooden puppet who yearns to be human, Benigni ... is steadfastly insufferable, from his naughty, nave stage through a transformation to a state of virtue that is steeped in a self-congratulatory martyrdom and nobility."
0,A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls.
0,"In the spirit of the season, I assign one bright shining star to Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio -- but I guarantee that no wise men will be following after it."
0,"Benigni's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted, its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow."
0,"The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough. The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed, cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque."
0,"The movie unfolds in a clumsy zone between fantasy and realism, and in the end it's neither here nor there."
0,What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log?
0,"What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona, here a more annoying, though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild, undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip."
0,I can't say this enough: This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies.
0,"Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone."
0,"An epic turkey, in a league with this year's Swept Away, that must be seen to be believed."
0,"While Benigni (who stars and co-wrote) seems to be having a wonderful time, he might be alone in that."
0,Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school.
0,Would Benigni's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster?
0,"The recut American version is truly awful, but a good 75 percent of the awfulness is attributable to Miramax, the film's distributor."
0,
1,A delightful experience.
0,"Perhaps too much got boiled away. As it is, the plot contrivances are too obvious, if not preposterous, and the portrayal of evil seems remote for modern audiences."
0,Unwieldy contraption.
1,"This mid-19th century tale of survival after the death of a parent is still compelling today, and its message of strength and the importance of family continues to resonate."
1,"The director has produced a colorful, affecting collage of Dickensian moods and motifs, a movie that elicits an overwhelming desire to plunge into 900 pages of 19th-century prose."
1,"Like the Dickens novel on which it's based, director Douglas McGrath's Nicholas Nickleby overcomes the earnest blandness of its eponymous hero with wonderful side characters."
1,"As a means to bring a classic novel to the attention of a modern audience, McGrath's Nicholas Nickleby is a success."
1,"Nathan Lane as the flamboyant theatrical impresario Crummles has never been better or more restrained on film, and Alan Cumming and Timothy Spall are a pleasure, as always."
1,"This is too much of a trifle to be considered a great Dickens film, but it's a pure-hearted adaptation bolstered by at least a dozen wonderful performances."
1,"It's no easy trick to resist the charms of Douglas McGrath's Nicholas Nickleby, and anyone starved for a nice hats-and-corsets literary adaptation certainly isn't up to the task."
1,"A generous tale, told through big performances by a talented cast, presenting a range of colorful characters that only Dickens could have created."
1,"The movie is jolly and exciting and brimming with life, and wonderfully well-acted."
0,It's a Filene's Basement epic for the Masterpiece Theatre crowd.
0,The cinematic equivalent of a glass of warm milk to soothe overstimulated nerves.
1,"If not every scene bears the Masterpiece Theatre seal of authenticity, the parade of vividly drawn characters is always good fun."
1,McGrath's version of Nicholas Nickleby cashes in on age-old show biz wisdom of 'always leave 'em wanting more.'
1,The movie's a rambunctious joy.
0,"To paraphrase a line from another Dickens' novel, Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato."
1,"If you really want a taste of this classic, rent the video of the RSC production. But if you're only looking for a charming time passer, this movie is just the thing."
1,"The entire movie has a truncated feeling, but what's available is lovely and lovable."
0,"McGrath has rendered the weighty, moving and engrossing Dickens tale into a near sitcom."
1,Plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as Nicholas' wounded and wounding Uncle Ralph. It's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens' grandeur.
1,"Trust and deceit, generosity and meanness are fleshed out by a deft cast."
1,"A terrific adaptation with a delightful cast and a speedy pace that defies belief, considering its lengthy source."
1,"With Dickens' words and writer-director Douglas McGrath's even-toned direction, a ripping good yarn is told."
0,"It's just sort of there, one more adaptation of a long rambling Charles Dickens soap opera well-stocked with respected British actors playing painfully stereotypical characters."
1,It's stuffed with enough morsels to make it palatable.
1,A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps Dickens evergreen: the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions.
1,"The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits, headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work."
1,"There's a bevy of hiss-worthy baddies to pick up the dramatic slack, beginning with Plummer's wonderfully nefarious Uncle Ralph."
0,

1,"Above all other pleasures it offers, it provides a classic of literature and social criticism with a straight run-through from start to finish."
1,"Pic separates itself out by hitting the humor as hard as the pathos, finding a nice contrast between the caricatures of the supporting roles and the dimensionality of the leads."
1,... makes for bravura storytelling...
1,"HBO is now the small screen's most captivating window to the past, though. Witness its recent account of Winston Churchill in The Gathering Storm."
1,"Vanessa Redgrave is rather more of a surprise as his wife, Clemmie; one more easily imagines Redgrave leading a government and winning a war than Finney."
1,"Though over-the-top and simplistic, the film has a punchy B-movie grit and gusto."
1,"Despite a low budget and predictable story line, Lockdown has undeniable power to it, fired by some fine performances and a terrifying portrayal of prison life that rings disturbingly true."
0,Doesn't tell you much about prison life that the movies ... haven't told you already.
1,"Benefits from authenticity, sincerity and an honest sense of outrage."
1,What makes the movie memorable is its authenticity.
0,Just a Rambo rehash.
0,"Here we go again with Tommy Lee Jones chasing a fugitive, right out of ... what was that movie called?"
0,A remarkably stupid and unpleasant chase picture.
0,This isn't a movie: it's a police report and the strictly-the-facts terseness of the story makes this more than clear.
1,The film has great forward thrust -- Friedkin's a full-throttle guy -- and the director knows where to put the camera.
0,"As a whole, The Hunted will not stick with you. But individual moments will be hard to forget."
0,"The Hunted is so openly, defiantly derivative of 1982's First Blood, you figure there has to be a copyright lawsuit brewing right this very minute."
0,"The Hunted stalks the masculine psyche with sharp knives, but it tracks its audience too noisily to bag us."
0,"The new psychological thriller The Hunted, proves once again that even performances by two Academy Award-winning actors -- in this case Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro -- can't save a misconceived, misguided project and a one-note premise."
1,An enjoyable movie that keeps hinting at something deeper that it doesn't deliver.
0,There's more suspense over which star got top billing than over who's going to pummel whom into submission.
0,"Has so little going for it, you wonder if you've missed something."
1,"A good ride, briskly paced, well played and vividly photographed."
0,An unpleasant action suspenser more dedicated to hurtling relentlessly forward than to vesting audience interest.
1,Friedkin is in his element.
0,The Hunted serves mostly as a reminder that three Academy Award winners are as capable of making a silly movie as anyone.
0,"Technically, it's well made, but it wasn't worth making."
1,"The Hunted isn't exactly fraught with psychological depth and nuance, but as a stalker-stalkee suspenser, the pic has some nice things going for it."
0,The generic title is your first clue that The Hunted is run-of-the-mill.
1,"Things take off immediately and stay in motion for 90 solid, economical minutes."
1,"Although it is a rough ride, The Hunted is also an exciting one. But no tracking skills were needed to follow its well-traveled cinematic road."
1,"The Hunted isn't grand cinema, but it's a good jog around the action flick track. Sort of like The Fugitive, except ..."
1,"An intense, if terse, character study that does not let us settle into comfortable delineations of good and evil."
0,"The sight of Jones expending his sizable acting chops on this piece of macho blowhard fluff is distressing only if you can't relax and appreciate The Hunted on a camp level, where it functions quite hilariously."
0,"You got your hunted, you got your hunter, and away they go. And go and go."
0,"The Hunted has little to recommend it but some well-staged hand-to-hand combat, scenes in which, thankfully, no one double-back-flips into trees with the help of wires and digital doodling."
0,In the running for is the year's dullest thriller.
0,"At a little more than 90 minutes, The Hunted has the feel of something that has been severely chopped."
1,"What makes the movie fresh is that it doesn't stand back and regard its pursuit as an exercise, but stays very close to the characters and focuses on the actual physical reality of their experience."
0,Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro batter each other to a bloody pulp in this utterly brain-dead and depressing 'thriller.'
0,This is schlock -- by-the-numbers action that ignores character development to the point where we find it hard to care whether L.T. catches Hallam or whether they end up running after each other until the world ends.
0,"By stripping an action thriller this close to the bone, director William Friedkin has removed too much meat."
0,"There's too much talent on-screen and behind the camera for The Hunted to be dull, but it is predictable and disappointing, and we seem to be missing about a half-hour's worth of scenes that would have brought some depths to these characters."
0,"Essentially a reheating of 1982's First Blood ... but the fallout this time is simultaneously more ruthless, less emotional, and duller."
0,"Ludicrous, plotless, ho-hum tale of lurid confrontation."
1,
1,A comedy as bracing and furiously right for the moment as it is broad and huggable.
0,"With Sandler as his simpering straight man, Nicholson makes faces shamelessly, rude noises shamefully, but he can't make Anger Management funny."
0,"Though Anger Management does have some amusing moments, it's too undiscriminating and scattershot to be worth paying attention to."
1,A happy experience.
1,"Lumpy, bumpy and uneven, but often enjoyably nuts."
1,Punch-Drunk Love for the masses.
1,It has its funny moments.
0,"A couple of brakes-off set pieces to the side, the antics here are strained, graceless and tiresomely crude, the sorts of things audiences feel they're supposed to laugh at rather than well-developed situations that generate genuine amusement."
1,"Flimsy follow-through or not, the teaming still works, and so, at times, does the premise."
0,The promise of Anger Management lasts for all of about 15 minutes.
0,The laughs here are painfully few and far between.
0,A comedy that doesn't call for a review so much as a prospectus.
1,Has its moments.
1,Unpredictably funny.
0,Throw enough money at a Sandler movie and it will look like a decent film -- except when you let middling hack Peter Segal of Nutty Professor II direct.
0,"There's no clear sense of purpose, no payoff, no building to a clever climax that leaves you weak in the wake of its hilarity."
0,A one-joke movie that milks its central conceit long after there's nothing left.
1,"Folks who loved Punch-Drunk Love won't care much for Anger Management, but cameo appearances by a host of famous names occur frequently enough that we're forced to stay alert, if only to catch them."
1,"Anger Management plays the same tune too much of the time to live up to its potential. Still, it's good for a giggle."
1,"Anger Management is not going to go down in history as a comedy classic, but it should generate great box office numbers and its broad approach will appeal to Sandler's loyal fan base."
0,"A stoopid movie, front-loaded with infantile shtick."
0,"Sandler's blank, doughy countenance seems duller than ever."
0,Some of the movie is so primitively staged that you can almost hear someone leafing through the book of instructions that came with the camera.
0,Everyone who avoided About Schmidt and other recent Nicholson movies on the grounds that he was actually playing characters instead of mugging will be happy to know he does no acting here whatsoever.
1,"Anger Management is a ragged piece of filmmaking, but the odds are you'll have as good a time watching it as Nicholson and Sandler seemed to have making it."
1,"While it includes some funny scenes, one senses that the Nicholson-Sandler pairing could have achieved much more."
1,"It's always a relief to come out of an Adam Sandler movie without a case of hives, and you can comfortably attend Anger Management without prophylactic antihistamines."
1,Miller time for the funny bone.
1,Anger Management virtually defines high-concept filmmaking: It's a one-note comedy that tries to soar because it's Nicholson and Sandler who get to play the note.
0,"The concept is inspired. The execution is lame. Anger Management, a film that might have been one of Adam Sandler's best, becomes one of Jack Nicholson's worst."
0,The only thing you'll be mad about is spending 10 bucks to watch Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler try too hard.
0,"Peter Segal directs individual sequences with a steady hand, but slack editing and a meandering and muddled plot make the film seem slow."
0,[A] disaster from the start.
0,"Embarrassed and clueless, Mr. Nicholson is clearly slumming. As a goopy, doofus pet-clothes designer whose only talent is nostril-wiggling, Mr. Sandler comes closer to playing his real self."
0,The free-associational lurch of the enigmatic Nicholson 12-step program is set to a familiar backbeat of juvenile gross-out and homosexual panic; what's truly illogical is the blithe conflation of anger management and assertiveness training.
1,"Even a longtime Adamophobe has to admit that Sandler is an agreeable presence here, and that the film has some funny filigree work to offset the oppressive schematics."
0,This is the kind of coarse comedy where a fart serves as a punch line.
0,"Strenuous, spottily amusing."
0,"Has hell frozen over? Not only is Jack Nicholson starring in a buddy movie alongside Adam Sandler, but of the two, Sandler's low-key approach is preferable."
1,The pairing of Nicholson and Sandler is golden.
1,"Can it really be true that the latest Adam Sandler film is, well, quite funny? Ish? Yes -- but only because he's paired with Jack Nicholson."
1,"No, it doesn't make much sense, and yes, it's irredeemably phallocentric -- but that is, perhaps, its saving grace."
0,"Unless you're 15 at heart, you may need anger management yourself after sitting through this aggressively crass comedy, which alternates between mean-spirited slapstick and arbitrary uplift."
0,"What is fundamentally wrong with Anger Management is that, try as they might, the two stars have absolutely no comedic or dramatic chemistry together, and so eventually the audience gets slightly bored with them."
0,"Audiences are still looking at the stars, but nowadays they often do it from the gutter of films like Anger Management."
1,"At over two and a half hours, the film's epic scale may not suit some Western viewers, but those willing to surrender themselves to the drama are in for a real treat."
1,"It's all vastly sumptuous, though the spectacle frequently overwhelms the dramatic impact."
1,"It does what the movies were meant to do: move, dance and swirl in the popular imagination."
1,"The story, adapted from a 1917 novel by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhye, seldom rises above melodrama. But the sets and costumes are intoxicating."
0,Often incoherent and disappointingly lacking in insights beyond the obvious.
1,Lift teems with life.
0,"The stuff about the three generations with the family, and the big drama, and the gang stuff that comes up, none of that worked for me, so I have to give it thumbs down."
1,Each participant has unique appeal.
1,"The eight stories entwine to form a fascinating portrait of a group of young people and their families, in which the peculiar, anachronistic spelling-bee subculture becomes a window into contemporary American society."
1,A very slick yet entertaining documentary.
1,"The documentarian keeps his story rooted in battle and suspense, and we cheer wholeheartedly for every nervous warrior."
1,"Whether from a Texas ranch, a Missouri trailer park or a Washington, D.C., housing project, these spellers define something unique about the American character."
1,"These determined, sometimes-obsessed kids stick with you, presenting a portrait of America as a melting pot unified in determination and a hefty serving of alphabet soup."
1,"Who would have thought that a nonfiction film about spelling bees, for God's sake, would be more mesmerizing than expensive fictional flicks with oodles and oodles of production values and special effects?"
1,"We cheer for all of these kids, because it is so easy to remember the pain of getting something wrong in front of the whole class."
1,... one of the most entertaining and involving documentaries of the last few years.
1,Who would have thought that following eight kids as they prepare for and compete in a national spelling bee could be so riveting?
1,"You find yourself not only rooting for the kids to make it from one end of 'heuristic' to the other without incident, but for their parents to make it without keeling over."
1,"Director Jeff Blitz's riveting, inspiring documentary Spellbound resembles a Christopher Guest movie in that it follows obsessed, socially awkward folks on a seminal journey in their lives."
1,"What makes the picture engaging is the extended preamble, where director Jeff Blitz zeroes in on eight contestants and serves up a mini-profile of each."
1,There is something so purely and positively American about Spellbound that it is indeed spellbinding.
1,All of the kids and their stories are remarkably compelling.
1,"I love this movie, and I love the pride, spirit and sportsmanship of the kids who represent the best of American pluck and luck."
1,"This is a great sports movie that doesn't need a field, a court or a ball."
0,"It's a commendable attempt to bring an overlooked and fascinating subject to the screen, but the approach is surface oriented and perfunctory, and I didn't really find myself moved, edified, or enlightened by the experience."
1,Spellbound's raw material is so innately charming that there wasn't much for Blitz to do besides show up.
1,Spellbound is a gorgeous weave.
1,Entertaining documentary.
1,Jeff Blitz's delightful documentary on the National Spelling Bee and its grammar-school competitors will win your heart.
1,It makes having brains cool.
1,Just might be the most action-packed suspense thriller of the summer.
1,One of the many pleasures in Spellbound is watching the reactions of these young brainiacs.
1,"Whatever else it may be, this is also a film about being young, hopeful and focused."
1,An unpretentious classic of the form.
1,"When a child stands at the microphone and frantically writes invisible letters on her hand, we can't help but love each and every one of these people."
1,A genuinely charming and often funny documentary about the high-pressured world of competitive spelling.
1,"Spellbound finds its thrills with nary a chase scene nor a quick cut; it's a simple and utterly gripping story about kids, words and a microphone."
1,"Spellbound is not a great piece of filmmaking, but it is more entertaining than you might expect from a story whose heroes are all brainiacs."
1,A hilarious look at one of America's best-loved institutions.
1,"The result is a powerful, moving and often very funny exploration of what it is to be an American."
0,"The homogenized quality of much network fare is especially frustrating here, in what should have been, if not a heartfelt study of youthful angst, at least a horribly good time."
0,"Poor little Carrie didn't need the big buildup. She's too familiar as it is, and despite a worthy star, she's all dressed up with no new, intriguing place to go."
1,"In the hands of director David Carson (Star Trek: Generations; From the Earth to the Moon), NBC's updated Carrie is more effective than I anticipated. The film -- especially the first half -- had me in a spell."
0,"Too much of ""Carrie"" feels padded, that we're watching an extra 45 seconds or a minute in certain scenes just to get them to fill out the time until the commercial break or allow in more f/x."
0,"In the time it takes you to watch the remake, you could drive to the nearest video/DVD outlet, watch the original ""Carrie"" at home and return it -- and still have an hour to spare."
0,"A misconceived comedy that despite a warmly empathetic performance from Kathy Bates, never makes its characters' unorthodox chemistry gel."
1,Utterly charming and not without those subtle insights into character and culture that mark [Merchant Ivory's] best films.
1,A bonbon spiked with delicious wit and malice.
0,"Entranced by the natives, Le Divorce reduces the knowing ditziness of Johnson's novel to vapid, exchange-student wonderment."
1,The Merchant -Ivory -Jhabvala triumvirate has once more scaled the heights of the 'cinema of manners' achieved in their repertoire of picture-perfect period pieces.
0,"A modern-day Merchant Ivory film, one of those blurry anachronistic duds."
0,A film in which the City of Light's seductions and perils are as dimmed as the novelist's point and purpose.
0,"Entertaining as an adult romantic comedy, but then it switches gears to become a silly suspense thriller."
0,A thin and unsatisfying concoction that somehow manages to make one of the richest and most durable sources of culture-clash comedy into an occasion for dullness.
1,"Starting with the artistic opening credits, it's an elegant film with literate dialogue."
0,Somehow lacks lightness and weight.
0,It isn't often that the Merchant-Ivory team ... misses the spirit of a good book this badly.
1,Deliciously droll.
0,"The script by Ivory and Jhabvala ... has removed all sense of nuance, which was what the original story was all about -- language, manners and the subtle degrees of attitude that mark one as French or American."
1,Features a number of very good performances.
1,"A relaxed delight, a series of delicately tongue-in- cheek musings about the clash between American and French cultures."
0,Should have been a smart bit of cinematic froth but instead sinks like an overworked souffle.
0,The nuances of French and American cultural differences feel as imperviously old-hat.
1,"Breezy pleasure, complete with cultural commentary that never quite stings."
1,Ivory's direction is so polished and smooth and full of smart observations that I never found my attention lagging.
1,"Those who haven't read the book won't know what they're missing, and indeed will probably enjoy what they find here."
1,"Though not as witty or accomplished as you'd expect from its pedigree, Le Divorce provides welcome relief from the lame-brained trash Hollywood has foisted on the public this summer."
0,Feels like a period film in clumsy modern-day dressup.
1,"If you are familiar with France and have a love-hate affair with that most cryptic of nations, you are likely to enjoy the movie from moment to moment, whether or not it adds up for you."
0,The boorish jokes about clueless Americans and ridiculous Frenchies are presented without finesse or point.
1,"For me, the best reason to see this movie is that in the midst of her amusement Johnson feels sympathy and admiration for both cultures, and for all its glitz, the adaptation preserves and extends the same sentiments."
0,... a flat comedy/melodrama combo filled with stereotypes about snooty French and gauche Americans.
0,Characters are left half-developed or undeveloped so that as much plot as possible can be crammed into two hours.
1,"A delightful blend of American sensibility and French chaos in a movie that is sunny, surprising and consistently entertaining."
0,The film comes up short on insight into its characters.
1,"A charming, always-engaging comedy of manners."
0,"For all that talent, and the lovely source material, there is something plodding about this comedy."
0,Mostly Le Mediocre.
0,"A decidedly mixed affair that wavers between hopeless melodrama and bland comedy of manners, scoring few points in either area."
0,"Veers erratically between sugar-coated romance, broad farce, and risible melodrama."
0,"It's all perfectly pleasant, but the movie lacks an urgent dramatic pulse, or a clear sense of whose story it's supposed to be, or even, from scene to scene, whether it's meant to be a comedy, drama or thriller."
0,"It pokes along like a Renault on an interstate, lacking drama or momentum."
0,"This is an insignificant film with a passably entertaining premise that goes wildly to hell the instant it strays from its comic ideals with brief, unsatisfying detours into the realms of art and high-end lingerie."
1,It is a well-dressed film filled with thought and sly observations.
0,Quite le drag.
0,"The tone veers capriciously from sophisticated comedy to broad farce and melodrama, with too many digressions for it to be more than fitfully amusing."
0,A tip for filmmakers attempting to appeal to young moviegoers: Don't hire thirtysomething actors to play recent high-school graduates.
0,"Laughs are virtually nil, despite a plethora of crude attempts at humor: jokes about vomiting, defecating, flatulence, bosomy babes."
0,A jaw-dropping exercise in futility.
0,Far too much of the movie's energy is devoted to rampaging hormones and irritable bowels.
0,"Manages to capture enough honest moments to make it watchable, but it's never really funny enough to recommend to anyone who's outgrown short pants and kneepads."
0,Braying teen sports fantasy.
0,"It's a cheap, half-baked attempt at a summer road-trip comedy."
0,"These characters are so flat, the story line so one-dimensional, that the whole triumph-over-adversity bit just loses its bite after the first five minutes of adversity."
0,You'd feel sorry for the poor actors if they weren't so perpetually annoying.
0,"About 65 minutes of plot and 30 of slow-mo skating highlights, rather obviously performed by professionals dressed as the characters."
0,"A lively, if at times juvenile, movie."
0,Attempts to combine the extreme sports visuals of a good Warren Miller ski film with the plot of a bad Tom Green picture and doesn't come close to landing on four wheels.
0,It looks like junk and even the few laughs there are feel like junk laughs.
0,"If you stay awake, you'll certainly feel more than a little ground down after watching perhaps 15 minutes of skateboard footage padded out with nearly 90 minutes of strenuously unfunny toilet humor."
0,"Humourless, hackneyed yawnfest."
0,"Without tons of exciting skateboard footage or a strong appreciation for the skating culture, nothing remains but pure pain."
1,"What Grind lacks in cinematic skill, it makes up for in heart, which is what most dudes-in-arms flicks are missing."
0,The skateboarding footage is underwhelming compared to Dogtown.
0,"A tiresome teen romp that never leaves the ground, despite its many aerial stunts."
0,"I think actually guys and women, who love skateboarding, probably won't like this movie because it doesn't do it justice-the skill it really takes to be at the top of the game."
0,"Without the charm or irrepressible imagination of the Farrellys or 'American Pie' writer Adam Herz, the filmmakers succeeds only in making their protagonists look like jerks, who well deserve the misfortunes that befall them right up to a happy fadeout."
0,A logo-laden celebration of the joys of sponsorship wrapped inside an innocuous teen-pic package.
1,"Brody and Vogel anchor the cast, portraying likeable, charismatic dudes with a friendship that is genuine and enduring in spite of their differences."
0,Among those rare films that starts at the bottom and burrows downward.
0,The worst movie of the summer.
0,Suitable entertainment for boys too young to shave.
0,"A wan attempt to transpose the sports-movie formula onto the extreme-sports scene, Grind achieves extremes only of lameness."
1,It's a blast of good gory fun that just won't quit.
0,Too often potential elements of suspense and true terror are sacrificed for intended laughs (in-jokes and otherwise) that don't always materialize.
1,"Beginning with the sound of flies over the opening credits, Roth's sure-handed movie is rife with queasy discomfort."
0,"Would make a decent midnight movie, but I wish there were something in it that felt original."
0,"It's a mean-spirited, drunken stumble of a movie unspooling in an endless loop of panicky foolishness."
1,"On the surface, Cabin Fever might seem like just another ripoff of the Michigan-made cult classic The Evil Dead, but it has a style and sense of humor entirely its own."
1,"Cabin Fever may be low-budget gore-gore silliness, but it's passionate low-budget gore-gore silliness."
1,[Roth] has more going for him cinematically than the folks who did The Blair Witch Project.
1,"An unusually potent blend of dread, gore and gallows humor."
0,"Roth and co-writer Randy Pearlstein choke up the occasional belly laugh in Cabin Fever, but they're so busy selling their jokes and their film-geek smarts they never figure out how to scare us."
1,A well-timed examination of moral ambiguity.
0,"Deals more in 'arrrgh, gross!' moments than in genuine fright."
1,"A ferociously entertaining and mean little horror movie that achieves the kind of outrageous vibe best enjoyed in a crowded, noisy theater."
1,"This impressively icky, witty scare pic from director Eli Roth combines the hillbilly-country horror of the first Blair Witch Project with the viral decimation and paranoia of 28 Days Later."
0,"Only the true aficionado of the horror/slasher/ deadly virus/ mutant-hillbilly movie will appreciate Cabin Fever at all, much less make any sense of it."
0,"It's just a watery, undeservedly smug update of the low-budget, kids-stranded- in-the-sticks bloodfests of the 1970s and '80s."
1,"You've got to love a horror movie that wears its bloody influences so happily on its sleeve, and then proceeds to roll it up and start swinging the axe in a different direction."
1,"You won't want to eat, drink or be touched after a bout of Cabin Fever."
0,"Cabin Fever starts small, and stays small, never reaching the transcendent Blair Witch heights of the biggest low-budget successes."
0,"Movies about flesh-eating viruses don't come along every day. Cabin Fever, which opens today, demonstrates why."
0,"Like much of Cabin Fever, the performances are competent and uninteresting."
1,"Other than a few witty jokes and a game cast, there's nothing particularly special here. Still, the nods to masters like Wes Craven and George Romero -- along with buckets of blood -- ought to thrill horror fans."
1,"Cabin Fever is imitative, but it's honestly and even reverentially so -- what Roth borrows he at least has the grace to pay back."
1,A clever and bloody romp over the turf of friendship and fear.
1,"Taken on its own repellently coarse and shocking B-movie terms, it's every bit as infectious in its way as the gross-out virus it depicts."
0,"The movie adds up to a few good ideas and a lot of bad ones, wandering around in search of an organizing principle."
0,"The movie is well shot and decently acted for its genre, but it lacks the distinctive vision to make it of value to anyone not already convinced of the inherent entertainment value in flying body parts."
0,"A loud, derivative grade-Z horror film of no particular distinction."
0,Cabin Fever is something you don't want to catch.
0,"This movie may appeal to the youthful, midnight-madness crowd, but there isn't enough in it to bestow it with classic B-movie glory."
0,Dopey comic interludes do little but disrupt the flow.
0,... disgusting and brainless ...
1,"Firmly in the tradition of the new generation of pulp-horror movies, Cabin Fever gives good value in both the humour and the gore stakes, without confusing one with the other."
1,"Definitely unforgettable, it's destined for cult classic status."
1,"For a movie about a man of ideas, Luther is pretty exciting stuff."
1,An entertaining history lesson.
0,"Even with Joseph Fiennes as a visceral, intellectual Martin Luther, the latest bigscreen take on the Christian reformer proceeds like a stultifying history pageant rather than a movie with a pulse of its own."
0,A glossy but unimaginative dramatization of the man's life.
1,"The film short-hands a lot of stuff, but it's gripping for a while."
0,It's just unfortunate that a movie about such a daring man ultimately takes few risks.
1,"Engrossing, as much for its history lesson as for its filmmaking."
0,"For all its scope and detail, Luther fails to convey the sense of history moved by a compelling individual."
0,More professional and competent than inspiring.
1,"An informative immersion in the history of both Catholic and Protestant churches, and a rather refreshing take on medieval morality."
0,An unholy mess.
0,"As the film veers uncertainly between meticulous historical recapitulation and shameless hokum, it brings enough characters to populate a mini-series."
0,"Deadly material, full of self-righteousness and devoid of balance."
1,"After a summer of numbing mindlessness, there is something frankly refreshing about a movie that deals even superficially with as significant a figure as the rebellious 16th century theologian Martin Luther."
0,"... I anticipated that Luther himself would be an inspiring figure, filled with the power of his convictions. What we get is an apologetic outsider with low self-esteem, who reasons himself into a role he has little taste for."
0,Curiously flat.
0,Luther is a film that you know will end with one of those codas telling us what a profound life he led. But the movie itself just doesn't leave that kind of footprint.
1,"Heady theological badminton, as vigorously thoughtful as it is piously historical."
1,"Shot on 100 locations in three countries and outfitted with impressive props, costumes, art direction and medieval streets, Luther makes up for what it lacks in vigorous storytelling with such production values."
1,"A few too many amateurish techniques and oversimplified confrontations hold Luther back a notch or two from greatness, and stamp it instead as entertaining Lutheran cheerleading."
0,Luther is rarely presented as anything other than a preacher. He preaches even in casual conversation.
1,About as swashbuckling as a history lesson gets.
1,"It's no surprise that Brody, Douglas, Walter and Leibman make for one highly entertaining, if messed up, family unit, but the big revelation here is Jovovich."
0,Pritikin ... serves up the sort of shrill 'satire' of middle-class Jewish vulgarity in which the mere mention of words like 'brisket' and 'klezmer' is automatically presumed to be hilarious.
1,"A mildly engaging addition to that curious sub-genre of American independent filmmaking, the whimsical comedy of Long Island alienation."
1,A romantic comedy of considerable charm and humor.
1,Adrien Brody rescues Greg Pritikin's self-consciously eccentric comedy.
1,"Pritikin's shrewd comedy-drama catches a fine flock of family emotions on the wing, and not the over-exposed ones."
0,"What could have been a biting dark comedy is, instead, uninspired and generic."
1,"Brody is a real talent, and Illeana Douglas is a riot as his older sister."
1,"[T]he best ventriloquist -stalker -family-drama -romantic -comedy I've seen in, well maybe forever."
0,Definitely lives down to its name -- you can see the lips moving on this wooden thing.
1,A likable family film.
1,"Little is asked of talking-animal movies, save charm, heart, and at least one scene where said animal wears a lampshade. Good Boy! has all those things, + a winning story line."
1,A devastating work of pro-doggie propaganda.
1,A swell flick for kid.
1,"Good Boy! offers more than its share of charming kid-pleasing surprises, deftly aimed at the 12-and-under set."
1,It's a gentle parable of interspecies love and loyalty and a very nice time if you don't mind a little Fido flatulence.
1,A simple but perfectly satisfying little story about a boy who wants to keep his dog.
1,Surprisingly nimble and fun to watch.
1,"No new ground is dug up in Good Boy, but the story is well-paced, sweet and lively, filling a void for very young filmgoers."
1,A film which effectively capitalizes on the human heart's weakness for cute things.
1,A winning boy- meets-pooch tale.
0,A painfully dull kids' picture.
1,It's fun in a kiddie-flick sort of way.
0,You wish Good Boy! aspired to a less formulaic cleverness and sentimentality than shown here.
0,Just don't be surprised if very soon you find yourself scratching at the door to be let out.
0,"As children's film premises go, this is a cute one, but the execution is a failure."
0,Writer-director John Hoffman leaves no canine cliche unturned in his pandering script.
1,"No, this isn't the stuff of a kiddie classic like Holes. But, to quote from another movie with a vocal four-legged protagonist, it'll do."
0,"Good Boy! is so gentle and fleecy, dozing parents might suspect a fabric softener was involved in the creative process."
0,A movie that just doesn't live up to its potential.
1,"An affecting, hot-buttered slice of toasted E.T. with a smidgen of Benji thrown in just because."
1,"The movie has elements of Lilo & Stitch and Cats & Dogs, but it's sweeter and wittier."
0,"The movie asks us to consider a race of superior beings who are built a few feet off the ground, lack opposable thumbs and walk around nude all the time."
1,A charming runt of a movie.
1,A clever charmer.
0,This premise serves mainly as an excuse to trot out every hackneyed dog joke in the book.
0,
0,"... terrible, terrible movie."
0,Jim Henson Pictures happy meal.
1,"Like a flea-ridden old hound that hasn't learnt any new tricks and insists on slobbering over your shoelaces, it's curiously loveable all the same."
0,Early hopes that this might qualify for so-bad- its-good status -- the sea salt played by Clint Howard is a hoot -- vanish under a volley of idiotic plotting and bad acting.
0,Unpretentiously dumb.
0,"Idiotically written, badly acted and directed, with Boll underlining the film's gory video game plot by intercutting video game effects into the slaughter, it's a staggering failure on pretty much every level."
0,"Cutting around frantically in a vain attempt to stir up some energy, the director, Uwe Boll, drops in occasional images from the video game itself, as if he were subliminally trying to remind ticket buyers why they showed up in the first place."
0,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a duller, more incompetent -- and less scary -- flick with cheesier effects in a remainder bin crammed with direct-to-video horrors."
1,"There's scarcely a whiff of originality in the zombie horror picture House of the Dead, but Uwe Boll has directed it with enough energy and style that it adds up to passably mindless if grisly fun."
0,Even connoisseurs of bad movies will find little to enjoy in this one.
0,You'd have more fun standing in an arcade and watching someone else play the game.
0,Misbegotten horror movie adaptation of the best-selling video games.
0,"To properly convey the jaw-dropping shoddiness of this videogame-based 'horror' 'movie,' one must approach what scientists call Absolute Stupid."
0,"Takes out a moviegoer's limbic brain and cerebral cortex. All that's left functioning is the reptilian brain, droning: Kill The Things. Kill The Things..."
0,Here is yet another video game transferred to film with little enhancement or development.
0,It's so bad it could well go down in history as one of the worst zombie movies ever made.
0,Don't come looking for a story -- this is a hunt.
1,"This wistful, soft-edged portrait of Rodney Bingenheimer, a social impresario of the Los Angeles rock scene, keeps its claws carefully retracted but still leaves a bitter aftertaste."
1,"Engaging, if ultimately wearisome, documentary."
1,"If this were a less aware film, Bingenheimer would be portrayed as someone who squandered his life in thrall to celebrity. But in fact, Mayor is careful to point out his quite real accomplishments."
0,"Gentle Bingenheimer, who retreats from being 'figured out,' is dubiously honored with unenlightened commentary by people hell-bent on doing so."
0,Long on glowing testimonials and short on storytelling oomph.
1,"Ultimately isn't so much about Rodney, or show business, as it is about the empty nature of fandom and celebrity itself."
1,"Would you rather be hugely rich or fabulously famous? Mayor of the Sunset Strip, a biography of radio disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer, is a chilling picture of what happens to those who make the second choice."
1,"Hickenlooper does a nice job blending Bingenheimer's flashy past with his somewhat pathetic present, creating a genuinely compelling study in diminishing returns."
1,"Hickenlooper is interested not just in chronicling the L.A. music scene, but in sympathetically presenting a man who has spent his life doing little but hanging out with celebrities."
1,"Bouncy, informative and funny."
1,"While Hickenlooper never takes the cheap route of making Bingenheimer a figure of pity, he manages to capture the halo of sadness that hovers around the man."
1,Entertaining though ultimately sad documentary.
1,"A sometimes sad, sometimes heartening look at what happens when the ultra-hip age."
1,A sad little movie about a sad little man whom time has passed by.
1,It's the semi-blank slate of Bingenheimer's life that makes the movie worth seeing.
1,This crazy-quilted exploration of the fog of fame deserves an aesthetic that approximates a night of extreme partying.
1,"Power, control and fame are not the driving forces in [Bingenheimer's] life. He only wants to share the music he loves with as many people as possible."
1,"Hickenlooper sees the movie as a character study, and it's an amusing one. But music buffs, in particular, likely will wish he had spent less time documenting his subject's quirky personality and more exploring his professional acumen."
1,"It's a funny-sad portrait of fame and its junkies, and of an era and its music."
1,"Evokes what the Japanese call mono no aware, which refers to the impermanence of life and the bittersweet transience of things."
1,What gives this its weight and substance is that Mr. Hickenlooper came to see himself in the man whom Nancy Sinatra calls 'Peter Pan in the school of hard knocks.'
1,Feels like an elegy for an aging rock pixie.
1,"At first a wryly comic study of a real-life, shag-topped Zelig ... Hickenlooper's nuanced documentary shifts into far deeper and darker emotional territory once it starts revealing Bingenheimer's heart-wrenching backstory."
1,"Occasionally laughable, often sad, and profoundly evocative of the way we live now, adrift in a culture saturated with celebrity and obsessed by fame."
1,Excellent (if sad) documentary profile.
1,"Energetic, nostalgic, occasionally troubling."
1,Creepily entertaining.
1,"Captures Bingenheimer in all his celeb-fondling glory. But it's a forlorn sight, one the film doesn't turn away from as it arcs from giddy inclusion to lonely pathos."
1,"Has a commercial reach that goes beyond local hero worship thanks in part to an all-star lineup of interviewees, including Cher, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Gwen Stefani and Courtney Love, to name just a few confirmed Rod-heads."
1,"This engrossing work, at once compassionate and rigorous, comprehensive and succinct, would be the centerpiece of any festival for the way it illuminates the life and times of the enigmatic, diminutive Bingenheimer..."
0,"What's missing in The Missing -- despite throwing in The Everything, from magic trinkets to group hugs -- is soul."
0,"Beneath all the requisite genre trappings there's a vast, empty gulch where the affecting dramatic element should have been found."
1,"Jones, the actor, has never been more wry, sly and taciturn."
1,"As hard as it may be to reconcile this as the work of the same director who made How the Grinch Stole Christmas, the fact remains that Ron Howard has never before made a picture this raw and alive."
1,As harrowing as it is full-out exhilarating.
0,Apparently the only thing tougher than endurance on the frontier is sitting through a movie about endurance on the frontier -- at least that is the point The Missing seems determined to make.
1,"The master sentimentalist has made a dark, menacing film, a lean and disturbing western with some modern subtexts that goes where no Ron Howard film has gone before."
1,A superbly crafted curiosity piece.
1,"Absolutely shameless in its propensity for violence and nonstop action -- and, most of the time, a heck of a lot of fun to watch."
0,"However bogged down by predictable story rhythms, banally assembled shoot-outs, and climactic mano a mano, The Missing has an acidic period tone, a respect for the reality of violence, and a refreshing dearth of superhuman heroics and easy triumph."
1,The Missing is arguably Ron Howard's grittiest effort to date as a filmmaker.
1,Easily the best western of 2003.
0,"Although based on a novel, Thomas Eidson's The Last Ride, the story feels stretched to the snapping point and is certainly unfocused."
1,"Powerful and provocative, The Missing is another masterful production from one of the industry's best directors and two of its best actors."
1,The best and toughest western since Unforgiven.
0,"In The Missing, Ron Howard somehow makes a great movie and an awful movie, all at the same time."
1,The Missing hews in every way to the conventions of its genre.
1,An admirably solid effort.
0,"At once racially fearful, and anxiously apologetic, patriarchal and post-feminist, pacifist and trigger-happy -- The Missing is engaged in one big, long desert showdown with itself."
0,"Despite the actors' hard work (particularly Blanchett), the whole experience ultimately has a careful blandness to it, and the family-unity theme is hit with the subtlety of a hundred hammers."
0,"A routine thriller, with Western frills and fringes."
1,"The Missing is often entertaining. But plainly something more was aimed for, and incredibly simple, basic missteps keep the film from reaching the next level."
1,"A good, though not great, contribution to the genre."
0,A big snooze because we can't take the main characters seriously.
0,"Suffers from the same problem that has plagued every movie Ron Howard has ever directed: It's crisp, efficient, well-made and strangely, vaguely dull."
1,"There are some Western themes and principles you can't fiddle with. Thankfully, when it counted most, Howard didn't try."
0,"A movie that is, by turns, needlessly unpleasant for cheap effect and misguidedly heart-warming when it should remain stringent. The Missing lives down to its title."
1,"The Missing is an absolute knockout, a western, a chase movie, an epic and the story of a splintered family and two civilizations at odds."
1,A first-rate psychological thriller that also happens to be a classic Western.
0,"The Missing works well enough as a spare portrayal of life in the West, but it never quite gels as a powerful story of reconciliation and adventure."
0,"A terrific setup, full of inviting genre familiarity and modern tension, borrowed from the novel of the same name. And then, as that mouthy teenager goes lost in an Apache raid, so does the movie itself."
0,"It's such a preposterous setup that I was always aware of the plot chugging away, and the logistics of the chase defy all common sense."
0,"The Missing is well made, suspenseful, and superlatively acted for the most part, but its harshness never feels organic to the tale. What should be devastating is just terribly unpleasant."
0,"There's a pretty good Western hidden somewhere amid the extraneous scenes, unnecessary characters and adoring shots of the New Mexico wilderness, but Howard didn't have the heart to cut his movie."
0,The Missing is holiday entertainment for anyone who likes either a dollop of feminist uplift or family values (or both!) with their bloodletting.
1,"... a strange and haunting hybrid that's part Western, part supernatural thriller."
1,"The rawest, scariest, most nerve-rattling saddlebags-and- sagebrush saga since Robert Mulligan's The Stalking Moon."
0,"Mr. Howard keeps the emotional temperature of the family reunion as chilly as possible, but it's clear that the father-daughter relationship is the core of the drama, and the rest is all time-consuming digressions."
0,Even Cate Blanchett can't save this misbegotten horse opera.
1,In 20 years it will probably be regarded as Howard's finest film.
1,"The Big Empty is much more a romantic fable than Swingers, the singles comedy that established Favreau but has a similarly jovial, unpretentious charm."
1,Director Tim Burton finally hooks the one that got away: a script that challenges and deepens his visionary talent.
0,"Belabored oddity that is one long-winded tall tale illustrated with hammy, artificial sets and gee-whiz acting."
1,"Not only is Mr. Burton at the top of his form in endowing his tallest stories and wildest magical conceits with emotional conviction, but he is aided by a superb acting ensemble that never loses its footing in the treacherous swamps of make-believe."
1,"A gently overstuffed cinematic pi챰ata, crammed with tall tales -- with giants and circuses and fairy-tale woods, + a huge squirmy catfish, all served up with a literal matter-of-fact fancy that is very pleasing."
1,Feelgood without being overly sentimental; romantic without being cloying; moving without being mawkish.
1,"Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult, without insulting the intelligence of either."
0,"The ideas keep percolating, but in the absence of any particular tension, the movie has its longueurs."
0,"You'd think that Burton, whose movies can be so invigoratingly nasty or so hypnotically moody, would be able to pull off a gentle, mainstream crowd-pleaser without making it dull or preachy. But Big Fish is both."
1,"Big Fish takes a while to get its bearings, but it gets better and better."
1,"A change-up delivery from a director seeking relief from his artful image, the movie wants to catch our ears rather than our eyes, and it does so without completely reeling us in."
0,"Big Fish flounders largely because Burton leaves out the meaning of the story, which was about the seductive power of fiction. In offering no meaning besides pictures, Big Fish has no power at all."
1,Burton's best film since Edward Scissorhands.
0,"The most curious thing about this magical-realist fable ... is how thin and soft it is, how unpersuasive and ultimately forgettable even its most strenuous inventions turn out to be."
1,"There are quirks aplenty in Big Fish, but spirited performances from a talented cast, led by a standout Finney as the slippery-fish raconteur, help domesticate the wall-to-wall weirdness."
0,"The movie has a great deal of charm and several good performances, but it is the son's judgmental doggedness that sets the story in motion and leads to its mawkish conclusion. It's a hurdle I couldn't get over."
1,"Big fish often swim in small ponds, but in Tim Burton's wistful new film about a son, a father and the lies that come between them there are no small ponds -- just big, bright movie sets shimmering and bubbling with the director's imagination."
0,A load of tripe that no attempt on my part could make sound half as pretentious and conceited as it really is.
0,"Big Fish makes a big push for transcendence, but the strain shows. It's like trying to push a daydream uphill."
1,... an amazing looking film.
1,The imaginatively illustrated but precariously precious film offers up a string of minor pleasures but never becomes more than moderately amusing or involving.
1,Big Fish is so strange and so literary that audiences seeking conventional fare may get impatient with it. But it always takes effort to catch the big ones. This one is worth it.
1,"Burton's fabled imagination runs wild with this material, and Big Fish often achieves a whimsical, poetic beauty."
0,"Clocking in at two hours, it runs way too long for a flight of fancy, packs a couple of false endings, and, a first for Burton, feels flat and familiar, like recycled Ray Bradbury."
1,"For me, a Will who wishes she were an Edward, the movie inspired by the Daniel Wallace novel is a minor classic."
0,"Herniated whimsy -- straining, as labored as those poor Brits who stuff their mouths with grits and try to talk like Southerners."
1,An enchanting tale from Tim Burton that weaves together reality and myth so touchingly it hardly matters which is which.
1,"Funny, touching, smart, whimsical, dazzling and, at times, downright magical."
1,"It's gentle and pleasing and I appreciated the mixture of oddness, whimsy and emotion that informs Burton's search for the place where truth and fiction meet."
1,A bountiful pleasure.
1,"Offers its audience a long and winding road, with refreshing pauses. And it proves that mega-budgets have not spoiled Tim Burton's vision."
0,There is no denying that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard. There is a point at which his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism.
1,The picture's images linger.
1,"Mostly confined to bed throughout the film, Finney pulls us to him with a flawless combination of theatrical skill and movie-star radiance."
1,"A whopper of a movie, told by the master of the modern-day fairy tale, Tim Burton."
1,"Burton has not given his imagination such free rein since Edward Scissorhands, and this stands with that and the equally generous Ed Wood as one of his best movies."
0,A long-winded indulgence in tear-and-a-smile whimsy.
0,A disappointingly dull thud of a fantasy.
0,Somewhat like Forrest Gump on a high colonic.
1,"A compelling look at the relationships between fathers and sons, and the child coming to terms with the parent's mortality."
0,
0,"Burton shows the rivalry between father and son but not the rancor, which seems to fit with the film's calm lyricism. But the father-son conflict is meant as the dramatic crux, and a forceful actor would have given it some much-needed bite."
0,This is a film that pasteurises both plot and sentiment with the efficiency of a Swiss milking machine.
0,"Overall, the film feels like it issues from a place Burton doesn't inhabit."
0,"The film doesn't so much reject history as selectively rewrite it to its own reactionary, even offensive ends. This might perhaps be just about tolerable were the film funny, illuminating, insightful or moving. It is not."
1,"Big Fish really belongs to Albert Finney, who proves that when it comes to large performances there is no one who can quite match a British Shakespearean with good camera sense."
1,"When it catches fire, this great-looking movie offers hilarious diversions. And as father and son struggle toward a hard-won reconciliation, Big Fish reveals its beating heart."
0,"Painted in shades of Mad Max, Duel, Crash and The Driver, Highwaymen is so derivative that it constantly reminds you of better films as it spits out a barrage of sound and fury."
0,"The cars get to have all the fun, and they don't have nearly enough of it."
0,"As car wrecks go, Highwaymen is a five-lane pileup on the freeway to hell."
1,"Getting a lot of quality cinema out of a tight budget, Jacobs (Just One Night) takes some risks in the storytelling department that result in a film that encourages one to think long and hard about the subject of guns."
1,"Martin internalizes everything, and Coburn must communicate only through pained looks. It's a tremendous performance."
0,"[It's] what happens when a director makes a movie based on what he imagines to be true, instead of what's actually so."
0,
0,
1,A wonderfully vivid and engaging theatrical experience.
1,"Utterly transfixing, a pure and heartfelt ode to artistic expression and the creative process."
1,It's a beautiful tribute to the Joffrey Ballet.
1,"Makes the world of ballet, seen by so many as rarefied, accessible and exciting, a rigorous art that yields breathtaking results."
1,"The dancing is fantastic. We get glimpses of the ballet dancer's life, the extra jobs, the injuries, the sex, the noise, the heartbreak and the egos. But the drama in The Company is all in the legs and the feet."
1,The film achieves that poetry of motion and lyrical delight musical films always strive for but rarely capture.
1,"Altman takes an elegant, appealingly unemphatic look at the world of ballet."
0,"Essentially a doodle interrupted by nouveau ballet performances, the entire contraption assembled to please the ego of Neve Campbell."
0,"This is a dull, lifeless production that will find favor only with those with an insider's perspective or who feel compelled to praise the acclaimed director's every film, no matter how out-of-touch and pretentious it may be."
1,"Altman's reverence for ballet, respect for the dancing life, and even his voyeuristic view of the ballerinas' bodies carry the viewer along effortlessly."
1,Altman presents a fly-on-the-wall insight into the lives of a group of people whose public face is one of unadulterated grace and beauty - but whose private existence is as disorderly as anyone's.
0,"Dancers are injured and affairs are begun, but no drama ever arises."
1,"Robert Altman's new film, which follows a Chicago-based dance troupe through a few months of its regular season, is enjoyably lithe and droll."
1,Why did it take me so long to see what was right there in front of my face -- that The Company is the closest that Robert Altman has come to making an autobiographical film?
1,Robert Altman's surpassingly beautiful ballet movie feels lighter than air -- but in fact it's the great director's most tender and memorable film in years.
1,"Watching it, I felt by turns engrossed, detached, dazzled, bored, curious, enlightened, and moved."
1,"Altman, showing the ardor and assurance of a master, pulls us into his film with seductive power."
0,"Even though the Joffrey, founded nearly 50 years ago, has powerful work in its repertory, the film emphasizes dance that is pretty and a touch vapid."
1,"It gives you the opportunity to experience the daily lives of trained, very talented and temperamental performers. And it invites you to pull up a seat and watch them do what they do best."
1,"A loving tribute to artists, and to art."
0,Lacks what could kindly be called coherence.
1,"The dances are beautiful, and the way the dancers live and interact have the ring of truth."
0,Feels like a documentary that's missing the surprises of real life.
1,This is an absolutely miraculous movie.
0,"Altman is a master at blending ensemble casts ... but there's little he can do with these nondescript characters, who quickly blend into a faceless morass."
1,"It's a joy to watch these colorful characters, and their exacting, physically demanding dances, from a leisured distance."
0,"In straining to mix the real story of ballet's demands with a romance, The Company fails to capture our imaginations."
1,"The measured pace of The Company could tax the patience of some, but the dancing is so well executed, and so energetic, that only the most dance-averse members of the audience would likely object."
1,A love letter to performers who put their egos and bodies on the line.
0,"It neither adores nor disapproves of its players, which leaves the moviegoer a little clueless, and unmoved."
0,"Altman thrusts upon the audience the responsibility of connecting the dots. But the dots don't connect, and instead of the resolution that generally follows tension, there is a feeling of having missed something."
1,"Altman ... whose intuition for placing the camera in just the right spot has always been impressive. In the dance scenes, it's flawless."
0,Meanders aimlessly until eventually falling flat on its face.
1,"This is Altman at his easiest, his most unruffled, and complete."
0,"The film suffers from uneven acting, an over-reliance on production values and an uncertainty over how dangerous the children's adventures should be."
0,"This is by no means a bad film, just one that's not as successful as we'd wish."
0,There's nothing to crow about.
1,This impressive children's adventure strikes a balance between magical adventure and heartfelt emotion that the wizard from Hogwarts has yet to discover.
1,One of the best versions of Peter Pan to reach the screen.
0,Bring back Mary Martin and her spot-the-wires flying routine.
1,"The director, P.J. Hogan, celebrates Peter's elfin derring-do yet recognizes that there's something a bit lonely about it."
1,Works as mind-tickling entertainment that never stoops to the vulgarities or frenetic pacing of most family films.
1,"The sweep of the story will pull along most viewers, young and old."
1,"J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan is a primary text of modern culture, and P.J. Hogan's live-action rendition is the only one, screen or stage, to completely uncage this changeling and give it flight."
0,Faithful to its source but rather unremarkable as a movie experience.
1,"I walked in anticipating a sweet kiddie fantasy and was surprised to find a film that takes its story very seriously indeed, thank you, and even allows a glimpse of underlying sadness."
1,"The movie may not soar, but this awfully big adventure is far from earthbound."
0,"It ends up being the grown-up version of a children's story, and may have trouble finding an audience."
0,"With only a few exceptions, the performances (and the script) range between dull and mediocre."
1,"In this incarnation, Peter is imbued with a greater degree of psychological darkness than before."
0,"Familiarity doesn't exactly breed contempt, yet despite the novelty of a real boy as Peter, the movie does engender a listless been-there / eaten-that reaction."
1,A tribute to the power of good storytelling.
1,Little children may find it a bit scary ... but it's a warmhearted and often magical adventure.
1,"If, as you go into the theater, you hear people coming out still chanting 'I do believe in fairies. I do! I do!' do not be alarmed. Soon you will be joining them."
1,Hogan's shimmering vision of Peter Pan is rewardingly sumptuous and faithful.
1,"It's not completely joyless, as Spielberg's Hook was. And it is not without its laughs and little pleasures."
0,"What it is lacking is any kind of wonder. True fairy dust is in decidedly short supply and without it, the movie sinks like a cannonball."
1,What distinguishes this Peter Pan from other versions is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up.
1,Sumptuous-looking and engagingly acted.
1,Both enchantingly old-fashioned and daringly modern.
1,"Action-fortified, touching and entertaining from its beguiling beginning to its dreamy conclusion."
1,Has in the young British actress Rachel Hurd-Wood a Wendy for the ages.
0,"There just isn't enough in the movie, despite its marvelous design, to warrant another visit to this material."
0,"Possesses effects galore, although curiously little to spark the imagination."
1,"If you're interested in returning to Neverland -- or taking some young person along for the ride -- this Pan will serve you well. For others, though, the flight might seem too familiar."
1,If this film is passed over for technical Academy Award nominations it would be a real oversight.
1,A dazzling retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale.
1,
0,"Most kids will be bored for much of the time, and are unlikely to be attracted by the juvenile performers."
0,"These ingredients are digitally present and correct, but Hogan fails to inject much excitement into the many boisterous action sequences."
1,"Clearly a star in the making, Hurd-Wood demonstrates a maturity far beyond her 13 years, especially in the easy way she adopts the role of surrogate mother to The Lost Boys once in Never-Never Land."
1,Hogan has managed to remain faithful to Barrie's Edwardian spirit without making him feel musty.
0,It's difficult to tell which is worse -- the acting or the writing.
1,A guzzle of yahoo-Mountain Dew empty-calorie satisfaction.
0,This monotonously macho action-adventure film wears testosterone as if it were a new fragrance.
0,A high-decibel biker flick that puts the 'less' back in mindless.
0,The biker toughs in Torque sure do break a lot of laws. Mostly those of physics and common sense.
0,"Welcome to the last frontier in computer-generated effects -- where you're not even supposed to believe that what you're seeing is possible, just cool."
1,"As long as you consume it as fast as it moves, you won't get indigestion."
1,"Torque is a terrific action picture, fast-moving, studded with great stunts and smart enough not to take itself too seriously."
0,A movie made by people who seem to have chuckled up their sleeves as they shot the picture and expect to laugh all the way to the bank afterwards.
0,A towering bore.
0,"The loudest, trashiest, stupidest, cheesiest celebration of ritualized male aggression of 2004."
0,"Even the more attention-grabbing scenes are too obviously faked to build suspense, and too confusingly cut to sustain continuity."
0,The script here is irredeemably 2 fetid and 2 foolish.
0,The creators of Torque needn't have gone to all the trouble of making a movie; they could have proceeded straight to the video game.
0,A strong candidate for the most thunderingly stupid movie of the year.
0,"Torque is a vacuous variation on an old beer slogan: Looks great, less filling."
0,A chase picture for 12-year-olds.
0,A vapid attempt to ride the high-octane coattails of Fast and Furious.
0,A full-throttle video-game ride for the MTV set.
0,"If your idea of a great time is drinking a case of Red Bull while playing video games at top volume, Torque ought to provide just the right level of hyperstimulation."
1,A good stupid movie.
1,It's got ... a solid sense of humor about its own awfulness.
0,Movies like this are best enjoyed with your mind completely on autopilot.
0,"If you approach the movie with a sense of humor and an appreciation for the preposterous, you may have a decent time."
0,"For all the fast cuts, the furious vibes, the faux sexiness, Torque is canned and mighty flat."
0,"The film is better than it might have been, and better than it had to be. Take it on its own terms, and you might find it interesting."
0,"This is a movie that knows you know it's dumb, and that's enough to make the whole thing worth tolerating."
0,"A biker picture for the Xbox generation, Torque is the most senseless assault on the senses imaginable."
0,"Produces little in the way of rotation, torsion or anything else that could be roughly diagrammed as excitement."
1,"Thankfully, Torque knows what it wants to be ... and flashes a jocular self-awareness about its genre affiliation."
1,"Blessed with a tongue-in-cheek script, plenty of burning-rubber chases, and a sense of its own ridiculousness."
0,"Shot like a feature-length commercial, Torque is as bright and shiny and inconsequential as a chrome hubcap."
1,"A skilled documentarian, Block moves briskly from easily relatable domestic scenarios to more tragic ones, and changes things up by focusing on two young marrieds-to-be."
1,"The scary part about 112 Weddings is not even the divorced couples, but the still-married, happy but stressed ones talking honestly."
1,"Disappointingly, the obvious question of Block's own marital/domestic situation is avoided. It's an entertaining study, though."
1,"With the gulf between audience and film subjects reduced by thoughtful honesty, our investment in the fates of each couple and individual skyrockets."
0,The film's sometimes downbeat tone can't help but evoke memories of Philip Larkin's The Whitsun Weddings.
1,"112 Weddings is a bittersweet portrait of the state of modern marriage, as interpreted by a New York wedding photographer."
0,"Emphatically acted, ponderous, and ultimately a little silly."
1,Dafoe makes Martin's role as head of the company as naturalistic as that of any contemporary SoHo creative director.
0,"A talky, sententious affair."
0,"Top-notch cinematography and set design that perfectly capture a hardscrabble medieval milieu, along with artful but sluggish direction by Paul McGuigan, make this a superficially faultless production that somehow lacks juice."
0,Has so many ideas working in it that they all but suffocate its thin plot.
0,"A comparably lively wrap-up comes maybe 100 minutes in, which is mighty late for an already near-quaint drama to be getting its jump-start."
1,"A serial-killer movie without a car chase, a wise older cop, a pounding electronic score or even Ashley Judd. Apparently, miracles do happen."
0,"Fine cast delivers the goods, but the murkiness is thick and finally overpowering."
1,"For its first hour or so, the story moves at a steady clip, generating enough mystery to keep you guessing and enough atmosphere to keep you interested."
1,Beneath the ill-fitting title lies an intriguing if flawed medieval murder mystery.
1,"The Reckoning is uneven sometimes, it's implausible, but I admire the chances it takes and I liked its bold heart."
0,The fascinating issue of the secularization of theatre is reduced to mere whodunnit pretext.
0,"Director McGuigan doesn't show much interest in tempo or character development, and the pace is numbing."
0,"An intriguing misfire, with heavy-handed direction threatening to obscure the efforts of a gifted cast."
0,"The central conceit of 'let's save lives by putting on a play' seems not only artificial, but also hollow."
0,Carries too heavy a burden to succeed as the trifle it really is.
0,The Name of the Rose this ain't.
0,"Overstuffed and, in its own way, preachy."
1,"The Reckoning has just a little too much of the whodunit and the thriller and not enough of the temper of its clash between cultures, but it works, maybe because the simplicity of the underlying plot is masked by the oddness of the characters."
0,A listless avenger drama.
0,An ambitious but ineptly plotted British import that attempts to fuse The Seventh Seal with a period whodunit like The Name of the Rose.
1,"Has its flaws, among them a certain self-righteousness and a complicated storyline, but it is never less than gripping thanks to its gifted international cast."
0,A suspenseless amateur-sleuth movie.
1,"Celebrates the craft of acting both in its story and in fine performances by Paul Bettany, Willem Dafoe and Brian Cox."
0,"Once the actors set up shop, and Nicholas gets obsessively involved in proving Martha's innocence, melodrama and ponderousness encroach."
1,"The filmmakers expertly capture the 14th century in wrenching detail, all its bleakness and misery, down to the dirt-caked fingernails of peasants and priests alike."
1,"An ambitious, energetic and wholly satisfying movie about the dawn of dramatic and personal freedom and much more."
1,"It's not Shakespeare in Love, and it really has no third act, but there's wonder in the scenes of theatrical invention, of theater being made up on the spot, a play in the making."
1,"A thoughtful, clever and well-acted diversion."
1,"After a first hour slowed by exposition and a good deal of extraneous subplot development, the story catches fire in the second hour and keeps you engrossed."
1,"Wraps itself around Bettany's guilty secrets like a hot-water bottle, leaving more interesting characters in the moral cold"
0,"Although raising intriguing questions about the moral obligation dramatists have to throw a spotlight on taboo subjects, The Reckoning offers simplistic solutions."
1,
0,"As for young master Bettany, his Nicholas never managed to convince at all. His priest was insufficiently Godfearing, his adulterer not lusty enough, his actor too facile, and his detective too forensic."
1,"Marks its director and scripters as talents to watch and affirms that its young star, Emile Hirsch, is a big-screen natural."
1,"Unlike American Pie, it does not rely upon bawdy antics and bodily fluids."
0,"Plays like a late-night channel-surf through soft-core sitcoms, American Pie wannabes and '80s Brat Pack romances."
0,"Of course, once Danielle has awakened Matthew's inner party animal, the girl next door becomes a mere bystander to her neighbor's various wacky rescue ops."
1,Contrived from the start but gets better as it goes along.
1,"Though shamelessly derivative and amoral, The Girl Next Door is nevertheless funnier and smarter than most of the pathetic dreck aimed at the nation's teens."
1,"At this stage in Hollywood history, any teen movie that doesn't involve flying body fluids deserves some kind of commendation."
1,"If you think the idea of taking a porn star to your prom is funny (and I plead guilty), here's your movie."
1,"Emile Hirsch has the perfect stricken alertness, and Greenfield has a marvelous joker up his sleeve in Timothy Olyphant as Kelly, Danielle's quasi-pimp."
0,"What is disturbing and frankly distasteful about The Girl Next Door is how slick and shameless it is in its eagerness to blur boundaries, to squeeze as much transgressive material as it can into a nominally bland and innocent form."
0,"A lumpy blend of sweet teen romance and naughty, R-rated prurience, this comedy follows the improbable relationship between a high school senior and a former porn star."
0,"The plot is carelessly cobbled from dozens of previous teen flicks, with needless episodes added as space fillers."
1,"The whole thing is cheerfully engaging, thanks to inspired direction by Luke Greenfield."
0,What if you were a horny high school geek and a porn star moved in next door? Your answer will surely outwit anything in this cut-rate Risky Business.
0,"The whole movie is a fantasy, of course, but one that seems determined from the start to undermine our suspension of disbelief."
1,"Well matched with Cuthbert's nicely vulnerable performance, [Hirsch and Cuthbert] create a believable relationship on screen, despite the contrived nerd-meets-sexpot circumstances."
1,"Sexy, silly, sappy and often just plain likeable."
0,"Nothing in this film makes any sense, and Stuart Blumberg, David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg's script merely gets more preposterous as it elaborates on its implausible premise."
1,The picture feels fresh and audacious thanks to its smart script and sassy cast.
1,"This funny, surprising gem joins the ranks of Risky Business and Say Anything."
0,Seems mainly about ripping off 1983's Risky Business without attribution.
0,
1,An entertaining affair whose wild-card creativity never ceases to surprise.
1,"The movie captures, on the most basic level of tone and attitude, what it feels like to be a teenager, a teenage boy in particular."
0,"This is a dishonest, quease-inducing 'comedy' that had me feeling uneasy and then unclean."
0,"It appears to not only be made for hormone-crazed adolescents, but by them."
0,The film is like a hooker dressed up as a lady: It wants to pretend it has class.
1,Cuthbert provides a great deal of heart to this alternately lewd and chaste lark.
1,"A stylish, sweet and saucy spring surprise loaded with laughs and unexpected smarts."
1,"While not by any reasonable standard a great movie ... The Girl Next Door is a totally tasty one, a surprise treat concocted from only the most familiar mass-market ingredients."
0,"Risky Business, while cynical and salacious, also had style, charm and heart. The Girl Next Door is just nasty, loud and empty."
0,"The American male hypocrisy toward sexually active women in general -- and porn in particular -- is at the center of the new comedy The Girl Next Door. Unfortunately, instead of being the movie's target, it's the subtext."
0,The Girl Next Door might have been another slice of American Pie if it wasn't quite so unsavoury.
1,"This is not entirely your average greasy teen movie, and frequently manages to be quite funny, and ambivalent, about vicious competitiveness at US high schools and sickly, sex-saturated modern life."
1,"A striking, stately and ultimately deeply moving experience."
1,"The handsome, meticulously produced picture ... impresses for its rigorous recreation of the period and its refusal to turn the Kelly legend into horse opera."
1,"An unkempt, enjoyable retelling of the life story of an Australian legend."
1,"Marks a welcome departure from the usual rah-rah machismo of the semi-nationalist action adventure, but Jordan never escapes the mighty shadow of The Thin Red Line."
0,Monotonous and drags toward the end.
0,"There is a potent national epic struggling to find expression here, but this movie is too rushed and fragmented to do it justice."
0,A highly formal and conventional film that is too often merely ponderous when it should be stirring.
1,"Fans of American Westerns will find plenty to like, so long as they can get their heads around the accents and the occasional wombat."
0,Manages to shrink the grandness of the myth without clarifying our understanding of the man.
0,"Offers a couple of well-filmed showdowns and lots of pretty landscapes, but you need more than scenic views and stylish action to chronicle a life, especially one as controversial as Kelly's."
0,A leaden retelling of the legend of Australia's Jesse James that has understandably been sitting on the shelf for a couple of years.
0,"A handsome, action-packed biographical drama with a credibility gap wider than the screen."
0,"Ledger, talking into his chest for much of the film in an apparent effort to lend gravity to his performance, is pretty stiff, but so is Jordan's direction."
0,"To get swept up by the hagiographic treatment and to be all that interested in every nuance of this fellow's development, one might really need to be Australian."
0,"If Ned Kelly is supposed to be an anti-hero to root for, his speeches border on parody and his cause is really unclear."
0,"Ultimately, Jordan's vision is so murky that Ned Kelly remains as foreign to us as wombat stew."
0,"I giggled, with a level of disbelief verging on awe, at the notion that people actually woke up each morning to shoot this movie thinking that they were engaged in an act of entertainment (or sanity)."
0,"Our primary companion on this trip is Ben Stiller's Tim Dingman, a character so annoying that I kept wishing he would be vapoorized."
0,Colorless and flat.
0,Not even half-baked.
0,A woeful little comedy that runs out of steam shortly after its opening sequence.
0,An unusually static affair.
0,"Envy isn't a comedy so much as a welter of mugging, pratfalls and goofy attitudes struggling to coalesce into a comedy."
0,"Barry Levinson's attempt to match the Farrelly Brother in adolescent goofiness has its laughs, but it's really a movie that's afraid of itself."
0,"The low-key picture gets by on the genial charisma of its cast, but it fails to rise to the occasion when it comes to building to a necessary comic pitch."
0,Everyone involved in Envy has done better work before. Envy isn't good for them or us.
0,A forced and flaccid affair.
0,A shaggy dog-poop story that'll make you wish you could spray something at the screen to make it disappear.
0,Pure poo.
0,"For an alleged comedy with such star power, Envy reeks enough to wish there was a vaporizer that would make it magically disappear."
0,One of those cinematic curiosities that almost always fade quickly.
0,Envy can't decide whether to be an eccentric black comedy or a middle-of-the-road diversion.
0,Envy manages the not unimpressive feat of making just about everyone in it look they wish they were somewhere else.
0,Wrenchingly unfunny.
0,"The film is neither fish nor fowl nor some arresting new entity, but a lumpish coagulation of conflicting impulses and unrealized gestures."
0,One of the lamest comedies in recent memory.

0,A mean-spirited black comedy saturated with dog-poo jokes and only intermittent yowls of mirth.
0,A labored misfire.

1,Laudably exposes the dark core of the human heart.
0,A moronically inept and tedious piece of death-wish trash.
0,"Travolta is terrific as a bad guy, making Saint almost sympathetic. His co-stars however, flounder in a sea of bad lines, with poor Romijn-Stamos getting stuck with the worst."
0,Pic plays like a paint-by-numbers pilot for bygone basic-cable teleseries.
1,Trashy and disturbingly violent yet fairly zippy and amusingly cast.
0,"A sickeningly manipulative, by-the-numbers revenge movie."
0,"Its lack of subtlety is clearly a point of pride, and Mr. Hensleigh's flat-footed, hard-punching style has a blunt ferocity that makes Kill Bill look like In the Bedroom."
0,"For an action movie written and directed by a guy who has written a lot of lively flicks, The Punisher is surprisingly inactive, full of long, slow stretches punctuated by perfunctory car chases, shoot-outs and-or fist fights."
0,A ridiculously violent revenge story with no redeeming value.
0,"By the end, the Punisher's greatest adversaries emerge as an unwelcome trio known as jokey, hokey and hammy."
1,"No, The Punisher isn't pretty. But, like its low-rent superhero, it gets the job done and then some."
0,"For such a formulaic vigilante film, The Punisher has a far better cast than it deserves."
0,[Hensleigh's] trying to pack in too much and the density clogs the narrative machinery.
0,"In a case study of how to screw up a simple, powerful revenge story, director Jonathan Hensleigh punishes audiences with an unbearably sluggish action movie that requires the word 'action' to be placed in quotes."
0,"The ad for it claims, The Punishment Begins April 16. And boy, does it. About 1 hour, 59 minutes worth of punishment."
0,A revenge scenario so simple it could have been created on a playground.
0,"Think of what might happen if someone grafted parts of Batman and Robin onto The Crow, and you'll have an idea of how unpalatable The Punisher is."
1,"The pleasure we take in [the Punisher's] inability to resist his basest instincts is like taking a bite of deliciously dark chocolate: probably bad for us, definitely bitter, but still sweet and stimulating."
0,The graphic nature of the violence that makes The Punisher hard to recommend without serious caveats.
0,"This is an improvement over the unspeakable 1989 Punisher with Dolph Lundgren, but too often just seems like an unintentional parody."
1,"An entertaining, if silly, film adaptation of the Marvel comic."
1,"It may be pulp, but at least it's good solid pulp."
0,"For those who can stomach two hours of brain-dead brutality, the film has more laughs than most comedies."
0,"Tom Jane is a great-looking Punisher, darkly handsome and chiseled, even if the movie goes nowhere with the character."
0,"A flatline affair from beginning to end, The Punisher is painfully dull, offering no characters, actions, scenes or special effects of note."
1,"Hensleigh, co-writer with Michael France, makes the paint-by-numbers of organized-crime movies look fresh by tapping good actors and sleek camera work."
0,"The Punisher is so grim and cheerless, you wonder if even its hero gets any satisfaction from his accomplishments."
0,Thrill-less garbage that aspires to franchisehood.
0,"The Punisher doesn't rise to the top of an ever-growing, comic-book movie heap."
0,A movie as one-dimensional as its antihero.
0,An overemphatic revenge fantasy devoid of even a trace of excitement or wit.
0,"This whole movie seems to be a cry for help -- or I should say, punishment."
1,Thomas Jane is just wooden and buff enough to pull off the role.
0,This franchise is already out of ammo.
0,Gets us lost early in the first half-hour and never succeeds in completely luring us in.
1,... a lot of fun.
0,Mismanages its greatest asset: an unusual embarrassment of camp riches.
0,There isn't a moment in The Punisher that isn't borrowed or stolen from another movie.
0,"The Punisher is mildly entertaining, for all the wrong reasons"
0,A comicbook action movie with an unpleasant edge.
0,"Ultimately, Frank's victim -to-vigilante transformation is so morally unexplored it's emotionally alienating."
1,"There's something to be said for letting a comic book adaptation operate at the level of a comic book, dispensing cheap laughs and ice-cold sadism."
1,A charming portrait of the artist as a young boy.
1,Never becomes cloying.
1,"In the title role, child actor Rodrigo Noya excels in what is only his second feature film appearance. Adorably cute, wise beyond his years and more than a little geeky, he's also -- as his name suggests -- a real sweetheart."
0,"This loosely autobiographical tale feels inorganically upbeat, with all potentially upsetting material glossed over or truncated."
0,It makes February's Monsieur Ibrahim linger in the mind even more pleasantly.
0,"A slight variation on a formula that, from Central Station to Kolya, has become all too familiar in the art houses."
0,"Although Valentin is well acted and sporadically charming, it doesn't have much more heft that one might expect from lightweight multiplex fare."
1,"Funny, gentle and utterly captivating."
0,Agresti fattens us up with the kind of kid's-eye-view tragi-comic adventures that regularly supply empty calories in artificially sweetened foreign-language imports like this one.
0,The characters in the Argentinean heart-warmer Valentin spend so much time squabbling and yelling that after a while I began to long for a nice movie about a family of mutes.
1,"A sweet, often poignant little film."
0,The whole thing feels like nothing more than just a calculated entry in the international tyke-of-the-month club.
1,... features one of the best performances by a child actor that I've seen in a long time.
1,"Seen as the wishful coming-of-age of a writer, who escapes tribulation through imagination, the semi-autobiographical movie seems less sentimental and makes a lot more sense."
1,A heartfelt story that would have been a sickly sweet mess in the hands of a Hollywood studio.
1,"A film at once heavy-handed, scattered and heartfelt."
1,Heartfelt and artfully shot.
1,"The film is plenty charming, but lacks a connection to its time and place that would put Valentin's dilemma in context."
1,The film is warm and intriguing.
0,"Agresti has a decent cast here, but his story is so thin, it threatens to float right off the screen, even when late plot developments add a twist or two."
1,A child's film for adults.
0,Valentin does not quite complete its intended journey deep into our hearts.
0,The movie plays simply on the surface.
0,"As a whole Valentin is cloying, consistently overplaying its young star's pathos and cuteness."
1,"Sporting thick, black-rimmed glasses, a runaway imagination and enough nervous energy to light up Manhattan, Noya turns what could have been a pitiful character into a rambunctious imp."
1,The winsome child/unappreciative adults memoir is almost a genre unto itself. But this version is particularly well-cast and well-told.
0,A melancholy and overly familiar thing.
1,"A fine, enjoyable, uplifting fantasy that's suitable for viewing by all members of the family."
1,"An odd film for Steven Spielberg, which is perhaps why it works so well."
1,"Spielberg does not appear to take himself or the material too seriously, and his steadfast refusal to see the proverbial glass as less than half-full is more inspiring than cloying."
0,"Relentlessly behaviorist, the filmmaker seldom fails to pat the puppy and, applying John Williams's melodic treacle, woo the viewer with cheap sentiment."
1,"If moviegoers suspend their disbelief -- easy enough thanks to the diverse and talented cast, as well as Spielberg's capable direction -- they're bound to enjoy this cinematic fantasy."
0,"A bad film. Several bad films, actually."
0,Bland and semidelusional Hollywood sentimentality.
0,An uneven mix of comedy and pathos.
1,"An engaging, consistently amusing diversion."
0,Everything about this movie feels forced.
1,"Rarely have I been so acutely aware of a movie's softness and sentimentality, and rarely have I minded less."
1,A joyous movie.
0,Even the best of talents misfire. Here's Exhibit A.
0,Cloying and contrived.
0,The film is so flaccid and pedestrian one can hardly believe it comes from the director whom a majority of Americans would presume is the best this country has.
1,"A fairly small, surprisingly intimate movie."
0,"Spielberg has crafted the film with a proficiency as seamless, and impersonal, as the setting, and you may feel, after a while, that you're longing for your departure time."
0,"The first 45 minutes or so are interesting, as we learn about Hanks' character and his unusual situation. Then the whole thing takes a nose dive and never recovers."
1,An unabashed romantic comedy and Capraesque fable that takes Spielberg into realms he's rarely traveled before.
0,"The Terminal isn't terminal, but it comes close to flat-lining a few times too many."
1,Delicately funny and inventive.
0,"Discordant, unsatisfying, sometimes emotionally incoherent."
0,"The small joys it has to offer are wholly dependent on the willingness of the audience to indulge in the proverbial suspension of disbelief. And believe me, much indulging is necessary."
1,"The Terminal is quintessential Spielberg: perfectly cast, technically breathtaking, sentimental to the point of being one sugar cube away from gooey and extremely pleasurable to watch."
1,"I'm not in love with The Terminal, but I liked every minute in it."
1,"It's not bad so much as empty, self-satisfied and cute."
0,The dramatic part of this ensemble drama doesn't work very well.
1,"A gentle alternative to noisy kid-oriented action flicks, raucous comedies and the agitprop of Fahrenheit 9/11."
0,Feels disingenuous and dogmatic.
1,"The Terminal is so beautifully directed, so pleasurable to watch and so thoughtfully put together, it's a disappointment when you realize, halfway through, that the movie is going to fall way short of a masterpiece."
1,"This may not be a great movie, but it may prove a great feel-good balm to many."
0,The trip still feels oddly unnecessary.
0,Isn't nearly as daring as it could have been.
1,"In Viktor, Hanks finds a character worthy of his gifts."
1,A sweet and delicate comedy.
1,"Like so many of Spielberg's films, it's the dream of a brilliant child, and a lovely place to tarry before returning to adulthood."
0,"To watch The Terminal is to be in one -- your plane delayed, your future on hold, your pass in hand and nothing to board."
1,Unavoidably funny and touching enough that we can ignore its weaknesses.
0,Probably the worst-directed film Spielberg has ever made.
1,"This is the first time in my life I wanted to spend more time in an airport terminal, and Spielberg is just such a brilliant filmmaker; the things he does with light and with motion and some amazing tracking shots."
1,A feel-good film of such originality and sweetness in a summer of otherwise derivative sequels and remakes that it practically qualifies for miracle status.
0,The concept was there; the production abilities were there. It's the execution that fell apart.
0,"Even in the desolation of an airport lounge at midnight, Viktor is too pure, we realize, to entertain the ghost of a dirty thought."
1,"It's an odd fable: Viktor is the mysterious visitor who shows us what the American Dream is all about-in the movie's terms, compassion for others -- without ever wanting to become an American himself."
0,"Hanks is a likeable actor but rarely a subtle one. Viktor is another cutesy emotional heart-tugger in the Forrest Gump mould, all galumphing slapstick."
0,"So satisfied with its feel-good status, it seems oblivious to the bad casting decisions"
1,One of three films Lean made virtually as star vehicles for his wife Ann Todd. Here she manages to extend the range of her semi-hysterical screen personality into a flimsily forceful character who pits her amoral deviousness against... rigid hypocrisy.
0,"The film may be set in the Dark Ages, but the cliches are vintage sixties Hollywood."
1,"Just as we're ready to write this film off as Bad Boys in tights -- or a dull, Earthbound cousin to Lord of the Rings -- director Fuqua and his team of production experts wow us with an eye-popping tableau or panorama."
0,"As a primer in the thuggish territorial land grabs of the Dark Ages, it gets the adrenalin flowing and makes us want to learn more. But the sheer density of the historical material is often at odds with the cut-and-dried requirements of the action genre."
0,It's likely to remind viewers of Braveheart -- except without the emotion.
1,"One of the reasons this film works is that we don't feel as if we're watching these people through the scrim of history and legend -- they feel immediate, even contemporary."
0,There are things to respect about King Arthur. Just not a great deal to like.
0,Devotees of chivalry and Camelot should look elsewhere.
0,"King Arthur won't charm you, hardly ever will thrill you, and certainly will have you laughing less with it than at it."
0,"Antoine Fuqua's version of the King Arthur legend includes an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents the movie from being a complete drag."
1,It turns out to be as much of a swoony valentine to a social ideal that never existed as any other Arthurian text. But at least it takes the conversation with history somewhat seriously.
1,Impressively made and well acted.
0,The term 'unintentional comedy' was coined for a movie such as this.
1,A smart action movie.
1,"It's a solid, somber, rousing piece of studio zirconium: cobbled together from Gladiator, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, The Magnificent Seven, and five tons of Hollywood hooey."
1,"That the movie works is because of the considerable production qualities and the charisma of the actors, who bring more interest to the characters than they deserve."
1,A fine pretender to the historical action crown Ridley Scott's Gladiator reforged.
1,"For all this silly spin, King Arthur is a better movie than you might have expected."
0,"Most folks, when asked about the legend of King Arthur, don't immediately conjure up an image of Keira Knightley in a leather bikini."
0,"This middling King Arthur doesn't waste time developing character -- or coherence -- when a big, joyless, synthetic battle will do."
0,May the gods protect us from modernists messing with our myths.
1,"Forget all that accuracy business and just enjoy the movie for what it is: a large-scale, passably engrossing tale of valiant knights doing valiant deeds."
0,"This version has action, yes, but the love triangle among Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot is diluted, and there's nothing exuberant about a dutiful slog through the muck."
0,King Arthur may be far closer to the facts than anything in Le Morte D'Arthur -- and far grittier than Hollywood's old Knights of the Round Table or The Sword in the Stone. But there's nothing true in it at all.
0,"Such a bastardization of the tale that it works as neither history nor legend. And with the romance gone, only the blood and guts remain."
0,"This Arthur is long and somber, broken up by crowded, clanging battle scenes that lack the visceral thrills of, say, Braveheart."
0,"Combines the plodding sincerity of a Ph.D. dissertation with the brains of a high-concept Jerry Bruckheimer- produced blockbuster (which it is), and no one benefits."
0,"There's serious intent here, but an often thudding execution."
0,"Two hours of relentless battle, badly stitched together with a hard-to-follow story fashioned to give maximum opportunity for big, brawny guys to bash each other."
0,"Never seems to quite know what's on its mind, though individual scenes (a cool battle on the ice) have their moments."
1,Boasts all the hallmarks of the '50s historic epic save the presence of Tony Curtis.
0,"Overall, Arthur fails to stir the spirit; its constant talk of freedom seems hollow."
0,"Profoundly stupid and inept, but it's an endless source of giggles."
0,"Though King Arthur is set in ancient times, there's not much difference between this movie and Fuqua's recent film Tears of the Sun."
1,"By going back to its origins and dusting itself off, the King Arthur story has proved itself to have a very contemporary resonance."
0,It's hard to care about a valiant groping for accuracy when a story is so badly told you can't tell what the devil is going on.
0,"If this is history demystified, give me myth."
1,I loved the notion of the Dark Ages as the Wild West with swords. Thumbs up.
0,"A title card says this King Arthur, grimly directed by Antoine Fuqua, is based on the latest research into the mythic past. Maybe so. But one can't help thinking the research that really counted was that into the more recent box-office charts."
0,Gladiator lite.
0,Attaches itself to the Arthurian legend like some parasitic worm
0,
0,"Indiscriminately shot, set to insufferably caffeinated trip-hop, and edited with the superficial pep of a television magazine show, Let's Get Frank conveys its congressional star as a personality, but not quite a character."
0,"Between skirmishes in the Capitol, we get a portrait of the congressman as an openly homosexual man, with Everly's agenda much more about Frank's sex life than his politics."
0,"Frank is a worthy subject, but this treatment amounts to not much more than a somewhat extraneous sidebar to last month's The Hunting of the President."
0,Frustrating lack of context leaves you wanting a lot more in the way of texture.
1,"There's nothing new here, but Frank provides a genial reminder that politics doesn't always have to take the low road."
0,Disappointingly slapdash and spotty in its approach.
1,"Frank, who has been told he should do talk radio, is a natural in front of a camera and microphone, and his ease comes across in Everly's film."
1,
0,What it feels like is a 10-minute short that's been yanked every which way but loose.
1,A worthwhile addition to the reams of footage of the day the earth stood still.
1,"It recreates what those days felt like with excruciating precision: the wild panic, the moments of funereal calm, the spontaneous blossoming of solidarity and fellow feeling."
1,"If ever there was a prime example of art bringing order out of chaos, it is Steven Rosenbaum's 7 Days in September."
0,Uncomfortable melding of East and West.
1,This is a rich meal that may best be reserved for stomachs accustomed to such bountiful fare.
1,"Zinta, who's been carving a growing following the past three years or so, has never been better, definitively moving from juve roles to a charismatic young woman with her sexy, assured Naina."
1,Kal Ho Naa Ho would be incomplete without Shah Rukh Khan.
0,"Bollywood musicals, those big, loud, colorful extravaganzas from India, are an acquired taste and much of Kal Ho Naa Ho doesn't translate easily."
0,No amount of fidgety editing and anxious soundtrack atonality can distract from the creakingly implausible scenario.
0,Tony Piccirillo's independent video feature suggests a second-rate Off-Off Broadway play as it might have been captured on a camcorder by a doting parent.
0,"Despite strong performances, this drawn-out Day feels like a cross between the claustrophobic play it once was, and the R-rated After-School Special it wants to be."
0,Boasts one of the most ludicrous plots ever committed to digital video.
1,"Scott Speedman and James Marsden, two talented and attractive actors who know how to hold attention, perform with depth and range."
0,"What might have proved reasonably compelling onstage comes across as forced on film, with credibility taking a back seat to contrivance."
1,"At times The 24th Day plays like a two-man actor's workshop. As navigated by talented actors and director, it nonetheless proves a riveting ride."
0,The movie is never more than a hesitantly filmed recording of the play.
1,"A methodical case against the Bush administration's rationale for the war in Iraq -- a calm, rational and utterly devastating point-by-point analysis."
0,Moore created a movie; Greenwald gives us a cinematized blog.
1,"Robert Greenwald's sober, meticulous film patiently chronicles the ever-shifting case for war made by President Bush and his close advisers."
1,"Smart, engaging discourse."
1,"A film that's a model of a concise, cogent case for the prosecution."
1,A crisp historical document that is worth your time.
1,"The movie manages to slap some of the cynicism out of you, even if it feels more like a box of dossiers than a documentary."
0,"After listening to this steady anti-Bush drumbeat for the past several months, even the most devout progressives may start to feel as if they've heard much of this sermon a hundred times before."
1,
1,Provides compelling arguments that even those on the right wing of the political spectrum will be hard pressed to entirely refute.
0,"Greenwald does nothing with the interviews, basically just posting them, one after the other, with the hope that viewers will do his job for him. The result is one-sided and bone-dry."
1,"Starts in an unusually calm and measured way for a documentary critical of that particular military adventure. All antiwar docs, it turns out, are not cut from the same cloth."
1,A thorough indictment of the Bush administration's focus on Iraq.
0,There is nothing new in Robert Greenwald's sobering doc.
1,"If you've ever wondered why we got into the Iraq war and what still faces us there, this is the film that can explain it to you (even if you agree with Bush's policies)."
1,"This documentary makes an effective argument that isn't likely to spur much debate, despite the efforts of the filmmakers to do just that."
0,Uncovered: The War on Iraq is like a trial lawyer's summation during a lengthy case in which allegations are familiar but their full context is not.
1,Any person voting in this year's presidential election owes it to America's future to see this film.
1,"Uncovered has no interest in explaining the Bush administration's case for war for them: This is the prosecution's argument, and it is extremely well-made."
1,"Despite its slant, the movie offers some illuminating details, and director Robert Greenwald constructs a solid argument that the Iraq war was driven more by expedient politics than facts."
1,Packs a powerful punch if you're ready for a lesson in foreign policy.
0,"Made up of almost nothing but talking heads, and no matter how cogent their statements, it makes for a pretty static movie that's unlikely to engage anyone opposed to its point of view."
1,An intimate tale of how a group of strangers scarred by the past and with heavy personal burdens attempts to break the years of mistrust and suspicions built up during the war years.
0,"Without even realizing it, director Michel Deville's Almost Peaceful doesn't just capture the mundane climb back to the familiar, it emphasizes it."
0,Perhaps it's simply too big a theme for such a small film to tackle.
1,"Deville has managed to preserve the work's great virtues -- the intimacy, discretion, grace, and humor with which it speaks of both irredeemable disaster and the taste for life that survives it."
1,"In this gently observed film about Holocaust survivors, survival means something other than choked laughter and sentimental bromides or brute, animal struggle."
1,"Michel Deville's heartfelt and sexy film feels stagy at moments, but the characters are so affectionately drawn and the cast is so watchable, it couldn't matter less."
1,"It may appear to be the ultimate non-action movie, but in the context of these lives, it is the highest kind of drama."
1,The characters in Almost Peaceful are pulled between a longing for what is lost and a fierce desire to live. Deville's plangent sympathy for them keeps the sentimentality honest.
0,Handsomely shot but almost bewilderingly bland.
1,A mature and subtle film about how a community rebuilds itself after tragedy and disaster.
1,"Deville is an experienced director, and he composes this picture very neatly."
1,"This is a film of half-notes and nuances, and as a chronicle of emotional survival it is infinitely inspiring."
1,Delicately moving.
1,There's something rather lovely about the mood and intentions of Michel Deville's French movie.
1,"Generosity and love of life are the film's hallmarks. Like the work of an expert tailor, it's done with unobtrusive skill, essential warmth and seamless grace."
1,Unlike any other film I have seen about the Holocaust.
1,The result is pure pleasure for fans of the blues.
1,"A compact, fast-paced and entirely joyful celebration."
1,"Performances both lighthearted and smokin', backstage interviews, and archival footage projected on the hall's JumboTrons create an energetic gloss of blues history."
1,The music's sensational.
1,This remarkable concert film documents the blues legends who gathered at Radio City Music Hall in 2003 for a historic and joyous musical summit.
1,"Lightning is often great fun, and remains an important record."
1,Fuqua's film captures a night when lightning struck more than twice in the same place.
1,"Lightning is a joyous, toe-tapping celebration of a musical style born of sorrow."
1,"The best thing about this film of an all-star 2003 Radio City Music Hall concert is, perhaps predictably, the still-sizzling power of elder statesmen and stateswomen of the blues."
1,"If you ever loved this kind of music, Lightning will bring the reasons back. If you haven't, you'll likely wonder where this has been all your life."
1,An aptly named blast from the past that manages to sizzle in the present.
1,"Entertaining, exalting educational, uplifting -- and a total blast."
1,It's hugely entertaining.
0,The massive stage at Radio City Music Hall doesn't lend itself easily to the intimate particulars of the blues.
1,"If the movie seems at times a little thin in its chronology and scholarship, it more than makes up for that in the quality of performances that ranges from the cool fire of Angelique Kidjo to the hot smoke of B.B. King."
1,"Any movie with Ruth Brown, Bonnie Raitt, Mavis Staples and Aaron Neville (with his brothers) for openers can't be all bad."
1,Comes alive with the more relaxed performances from its senior set -- men and women in their late sixties through to their late eighties -- performing the music they've lived and breathed their whole lives.
1,Gets its great groove from the humor and dignity of the true blues musicians it documents.
0,"If you know the blues, you've heard it all before. And if you don't, the film, after a promising step-by-step primer opening, won't help you."
1,Some of the blues performances here are rousingly hot and could make believers out of the staunchest classical music snob.
1,"The event's musical director, Steve Jordan, marvels at one point: 'Looks like y'all hired the phone book . . . just looked up ""Blues"" in the Yellow Pages.'"
1,Features a who's who of world-wise bluesmen (and women) and newbie practitioners.

0,A better way to combine the church and Jane Austen? Rent the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice and read the Book of Mormon during the slow bits.
0,"Anyone familiar with the book or BBC miniseries (or over the age of 6) will not be surprised by the outcome, except for how wholly unengaging and tedious it is made here."
1,"The movie's real discovery ... is the shimmery Heskin -- in love with the camera and the audience, and marvelously attuned to the screwball stimuli all around her."
0,Awkward comic timing and uneven performances spoil the desired effect.

0,"In drawing on hackneyed plot devices from both sports movies and films about Native Americans, Schroder essentially has created an extended version of Walker, Texas Ranger without the intellectual dialogue or, sadly, Chuck Norris."
0,Many cliches and borrowed substitutes for creativity.
0,Uses the great recurring American movie theme of immigrants arriving in the big American cities to both good and bad advantage.
1,"Even as I noted a glitch here and there in the plot, I was aware that the movie itself, and especially the character of Lana, had enlisted my sympathy."
1,"The movie hinges on Orlenko, a Ukrainian model-actress making her American feature debut, and she delivers a sterling performance."
0,"It has all the passion, frenzy and violence of an Abel Ferrara film -- but without the vision, depth, style or control."
0,Low-budget gangster picture.
0,"Clumsily under-written and feverishly overacted, it's as embarrassing to watch as it is perplexing."
0,"Merriman evinces only the soft-focus moodiness of an outdoor-clothing catalog. The supporting cast practically stands on its collective head trying to pick up the slack, but to little use."
1,"Jim McKay's ensemble drama, the opening feature in the annual New Directors/New Films series, has a roaming, lived-in quality."
1,"The ensemble cast, asked to improvise its roles, interacts with conviction and chemistry."
1,It has an undeniable authenticity in its characterizations and situations and an empathy that is all too rare even in independent cinema.
1,"My only complaint is that it feels more like a series pilot than a stand-alone film, but thumbs up."
1,"Girls just wanna have fun, and so does the film, which recycles the requisite moralizing into a breezy, sporadically funny package."
1,Feel-good entertainment that is no less enjoyable for being somewhat predictable.
1,"It's a bouncy, funny picture that I enjoyed -- one that mostly eludes the perils of sequelitis and spinoff-itis, a lusty comedy about the importance of looking good and getting the right scissors in the right hands."
1,"Latifah is, well, Latifah playing herself -- funny, brash, smart, likable and not willing to take any garbage from anyone."
0,"Overall, the parts don't come together and jell as well as they did in the Barbershop films."
1,"Playing an eccentric beautician who changes her look everyday, the incandescent Alfre Woodard shows she's as adept at comedy as drama."
0,"This spinoff lacks the repartee and thought-provoking social commentary of the original and its sequel. Instead, we get dumbed-down characters and juvenile booty jokes."
1,Beauty Shop extends the popular Barbershop franchise to Atlanta and provides a sassy feminine counterpart to its cozy men's-club vibe.
0,You take the good with the bad.
1,"The loose, lively spirit of the performances breathes life into the cliches."
1,"Has nothing new to say, but it has a lot of fun covering the same old territory."
0,Needs highlights and a trim.
0,All jokes and plot points are telegraphed. You couldn't miss the clues even if your head was in the sink.
0,A dull script and slack direction.
0,Even a sharp pace can't disguise the lack of dramatic momentum.
0,"Looks, feels and unfolds with measured sitcom familiarity, right down to the storming of characters through the shop's doors and the relentless crossfire of sassy putdowns."
0,"At this point, any humor left in the Barbershop series is limited to a few stray clippings on the floor."
1,"Thanks to Queen Latifah, it manages to keep its comic shape, even with the wind of familiarity blowing around."
0,A bit too relaxed for its own good.
1,"The result is not so much a follow-up as a newly conceived comedy, and a good one at that."
0,A fluff job.
1,[A] formulaic but extremely good-natured comedy.
1,"The movie has a solid moral core that uses stereotypes to impart important lessons about respect, tolerance and hair conditioner. And Queen Latifah is irresistible."
1,"It's refreshing how most of the movie is essentially about the characters, their stories, their lives."
0,"The film resides in the realm of mediocrity, dreadful in spots, enjoyable on occasion, and disposable throughout."
1,"For all the vivid, amusing characters that surround Gina, Beauty Shop rightly belongs to Latifah, who comes into her own as a star and an actress in this film."
1,There is much to enjoy in the struggles and triumphs of Latifah's Gina Morris.
0,"It's a boisterous and amiable movie but not, in the end, a very funny one."
0,I thought this was too much like the pilot for a sitcom.
1,Latifah carries the weight of this film and does an impressive job given a script that's crying out for a total restyle.
0,"As in the other two movies, the plot is a thin cardboard box carrying an assortment of observational doughnuts."
1,
1,"It's nasty, violent, artistically barren and kind of fun."
0,A steaming pile of siege clichs and screaming unlikelihoods.
0,"As the story further ramps up the complications, poor plot mechanics run pic off the road."
1,"Director Siri's heavily stylized visual approach translates successfully, at least before everything reaches an overly operatic third-act crescendo."
1,"An interesting French action pic fights gallantly for dominance over a bulging, American-style shoot-'em-up."
1,"Accept Hostage for what it is, and a flawed-but-enjoyable ride awaits. I never once glanced at my watch."
0,It can never quite make that final leap over its formula.
1,"Made with energetic flair and no small dose of violence, mercifully handled with discretion, Hostage exemplifies taut, confident filmmaking."
0,The film doesn't follow its own rules.
0,"Inevitably, the action has to take over, and the film devolves into a frenzy of fireballs and automatic gunfire."
0,A pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero.
0,Hostage may well be the first action flick cited both for child abuse and audience abuse. In a singularly sadistic and degrading way it has something to offend everyone.
0,You might feel that the title applies to you.
0,"When it's over, you just want to make sure the vise that's been squeezing your head for more than two hours didn't leave any dents or scratches."
0,"Entertainment by force of will, moviemaking by sledgehammer."
0,"Explosions, gunfights and suspense may keep you awake for a while, but not if the movie assaults logic and holds common sense hostage."
1,This is a masterclass in how to come back after being flushed down the toilet for the umpteenth time
0,A tired formula.
0,"Speaking of torture, if you dig it, by all means lock yourself up for two hours with Hostage, which begins by administering electric shocks to your viscera and keeps upping the voltage."
1,"For action movie fans who require just a touch of depth and mystery between gunshots, Hostage could make for a satisfying night at the movies."
0,I'd call it ugly and I'd be willing to bet that you won't see anyone climbing on a moral high horse in an attempt to shout it down. Someone should.
0,"Strictly by the book: It's adapted from an airport best-seller by Robert Crais, and its scenes might as well be preceded with chapter headings."
0,"Not that there's anything wrong with testosterone and senseless destruction as long as they're balanced by some true sense of heart and at least a smidgen of believability, neither of which survive here."
0,"The subplots are stacked up and nesting into each other like so many Russian dolls, and seeming every bit as precious."
0,"Willis plays a man with a past whose nightmare returns when a hostage drama reopens old wounds, blah, blah, blah..."
0,"This is, in the final analysis, just another Bruce Willis Movie, albeit one that makes us think a bit more than usual and maybe hope a little harder that all those bullets and explosions will be put to good use."
0,"If it doesn't wholly succeed, at least it fails in an interesting way."
0,The writing and direction are simplistic.
0,"The movie doesn't spend much time on details or characterization, especially of its nonessential female characters (which is to say all of them)."
0,Doug Richardson's script is as riddled with plot holes as Pollak's house is with bullets.
0,"Beyond the cliches, there's something deeply offensive about the way Hostage exploits our empathy for children in peril."
0,"The film quickly collapses into incoherence with a barrage of bullets, Molotov cocktails and the arrival of a SWAT team."
0,"A well-intended but perfunctorily overblown feature produced by and starring Bruce Willis, whose emotionally raw performance is the film's saving grace."
0,"By the time Willis's character saves this considerably long day, it's filmgoers who will no doubt feel like prisoners."
0,It doesn't satisfy in the way a good thriller ought to.
1,"Bruce Willis, who feels like a resident of action thrillers, not a visitor, dials down here into a man of fierce focus and private motives."
0,"The script is clever without ever being smart, the violence is showy but not cathartic, and the performances are, to put it kindly, a mixed bag."
0,"I thought, this is going to be a first-rate thriller, nobody plays that kind of character better than Bruce Willis, he's great at that. And then it just gets more and more complicated and more and more ridiculous."
0,Visually stylish but highly improbable.
0,Hostage is all the pulp thriller Bruce Willis movies you've seen before.
0,Brainlessly efficient.
0,Is this what passes for family entertainment these days?
0,Will the audience follow Ice Cube on this road trip to benign banality? Here's hoping he books a nonstop return ticket.
0,Never arrives at any entertaining destination.
0,"Its star Ice Cube remains characteristically amiable, but this thuddingly miscalculated comedy is way beneath him."
0,"The always charismatic Ice Cube makes Are We There Yet? watchable, but his young charges are such insufferable brats that the hero's change of heart remains a mystery."
0,"If your requirements for good comedy begin and end with a swift kick to the groin, Are We There Yet? is the movie for you."
1,"The strength of Ice Cube's performance is his willingness to show vulnerability. When he says he doesn't like kids, he means it. But when he cares, you feel it."
0,"Cube is a human teddy bear. His charm is about the only thing that carries the movie, 96 manic minutes of two obnoxious children holding hostage their caretaker."
0,"Why can't anyone in Hollywood find something more worthy for the lovely, talented Nia Long to do besides play a simpering single mom? This isn't the first time I've asked such a question, and I'm sure it won't be the last."
0,Feels more like 'Is It Over Yet?'
0,"Are We There Yet? won't make your day, but it won't kill it either."
0,"Lacks the courage of its grape-juice-, mud-, and vomit-spattered convictions."
0,How much sweeter Nick's heart-to-heart with Lindsey and Kevin would be if the movie was more than a clich챕d journey.
0,"Uh oh, pull over, I think I'm gonna be car sick."
0,Worse than the crude humor is the movie's forced sentiment.
0,Is it over yet? Is it over yet? Is it over yet?
0,Ice Cube has let so many of his hard edges melt off that he can't even manage a decent tantrum here.
1,"Delivers on some pretty basic childhood fantasies -- chiefly, kids seeing themselves in control, and watching adults in comical pain. And it does it too quickly and competently for their grown-up chaperones to mind much."
0,Are we laughing yet?
0,"The kids finally soften Cube's heart (and vice versa), get Mom to see past his scowl and into his kind heart, and become a wholesome unit that makes this a distastefully fit and formulaic family film."
0,"Shows children behaving in ways that go right to the edge of absolute evil, and who are snotty and charmless besides. At the same time, the movie demands that we should feel warm toward those kids after all."
0,"Never quite arrives, and perhaps at a cost to Ice Cube's career."
0,"We've got stereotypes-a-go-go: Raging redneck truckers. Accented Asians. Country bumpkins. Black fathers missing in action. The humor's a tad too raunchy for the kids, and the predictable plot won't win over any of the parents."
0,"Phony and formulaic from start to finish, the movie may make some viewers feel as if they're trapped in a car themselves with a driver who won't pull over."
0,"I would have loved to see a genuine love story involving Ice Cube, Nia Long, and the challenge of a lifelong bachelor dating a woman with children. Sad that a story like that couldn't get made, but this shrill 'comedy' could."
1,Ice Cube is an essentially soft-screen presence despite the assumed belligerence of his shtick. His knotted scowl hides a mushy middle of basic human decency.
0,Parents should be warned that dropping the kids off at this one may be tantamount to child abuse.
0,This gnarly and illogical little sitcom is bound to make any adult reconsider that next outing with the kids.
0,The gags seem pretty lame even by the standards assiduously applied by most 8-year-olds.
0,These kids are going after perfectly innocent nice adults. They are some of the nastiest children in movie history.
0,A joyless road-trip comedy that's about as pleasant as a bad case of car sickness.
0,That we're supposed to find any of these characters appealing is just one of the mysteries posed by this so-called 'family' comedy.
0,"Are We There Yet? all too effectively conveys the claustrophobic horror of being shackled in a small space with two whiny, hateful children."
0,
0,It was really only a matter of time before 10-year-old Dakota Fanning brought her unsettling precocity to the horror genre. And it's a bit of a waste.
0,"Movies about the psychological abuse of a child can be powerful when the subject matter is handled in a serious, sensitive manner. But when it is employed as a plot device to enable a surprise revelation, it becomes offensive."
1,"The movie is not without merit. Ten-year-old Fanning ably handles her part, which alternately requires her to adopt a thousand-yard stare and look like a scared little girl."
0,"Unless you're a connoisseur of movies that are so bad they're good, Hide and Seek is one game you're not going to want to play."
0,Add this movie to Robert De Niro's climb up Mount Hackdom.
0,Robert De Niro rises to a formidable challenge in this sufficiently unsettling thriller: he holds his own against the scene-swiping 10-year-old actress Dakota Fanning.
0,The movie's main purpose seems to be to make audiences squirm uncomfortably. Yelp and shriek in armchair-clawing glee? Not likely.
0,"The plodding director, John Polson, reliably telegraphs the big boos, and the next time I see an actor gingerly open a cupboard and get knocked back by an overamplified screeching cat, I'm walking."
0,"The movie wants in the worst way to be among the new wave of big-screen chillers, served with a twist. As the old joke goes, they've succeeded -- in the worst way."
1,A nifty little thriller with some effective psychological and supernatural flourishes.
1,"The actor who gave us Johnny Boy, Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and the young Vito Corleone still has his chops."
0,
0,It's so absolutely preposterous that it stops the film cold and draws a collective 'Aw c'mon!' from viewers wondering if maybe they should take back some of that ill will that greeted M. Night Shyamalan's surprise turn of events in The Village.
0,"The movie's only rewards are a few unintentional laughs, as when the sheriff (Dylan Baker) calls Emily a 'cute kid' after a long stretch in which she's been acting and looking battier than Sunset Boulevard's Norma Desmond."
0,The camera leers at 10-year-old Fanning to the brink of criminality.
0,Hide and Seek really isn't a suspense thriller at all. It's a mystery movie. It's always a mystery when highly talented people commit the time and effort to a film that is so obviously mediocre.
1,"For the first hour or so it builds inexorably to an excruciating level of dread. It does this so well, we're willing to forgive the small lapses of logic it takes to get us there."
0,"The second half gets downright silly as the country home turns into a slaughterhouse. What could have been a Sixth Sense-style intelligent thriller heads straight for the drive-in, though it's still handled with considerable skill."
0,"As a fright movie, Hide and Seek is only a middling thriller. But as a tip sheet for real estate shoppers in wooded rural areas, it's top-notch."
0,Give us a reason to care.
0,"The result is more campy than scary, and in the horror game, that means nobody wins."
0,"The mystery is maintained only through characters' behaving against their own interest, doing things they wouldn't do, failing to mention things they certainly would mention."
0,There are few scares and even less logic.
0,The movie is bad in the sense of being morally reprehensible.
0,"The last weekend of January is traditionally a dumping ground for turkeys at the multiplexes, so don't say you weren't warned."
0,"There was a point in the movie when suddenly everything clicked, and the Law of Economy of Characters began to apply. That is the law that says no actor is in a movie unless his character is necessary."
0,"High class briefly gives way to high camp, which then itself dissipates to an anticlimactic thud."
1,It doesn't get stupid for a long time! That's the finest compliment these kind of movies can aspire to. This means you'll have a decent time.
0,"Another of those real-estate horror movies that sticks it to urbanites who overspend on picturesque Victorian houses in towns where the locals resent them. For city folk in rambling country homes, something wicked this way comes."
0,"It's become almost trite to criticize him for his recent string of dubious movies, but we'll do it anyway, because he's capable of so much better."
0,You won't find anything startling or memorable.
0,"Through its first two-thirds, at least, Hide and Seek does a good enough job of piquing our curiosity that the movie's ultimate dumbness is more than a minor insult."
1,"I think it's just so well made, so well photographed."
0,Follows no semblance of internal logic.
0,"[An] idiotic, yawn-a-minute thriller."
0,The movie goes down the tubes in the last third.
0,De Niro continues his long slide into mediocrity with yet another charmless psycho-thriller.
0,"A tawdry cocktail of red herrings, cheap psychology, and shameless horror-movie tropes."
1,In the least preachy way possible it celebrates the natural world to make viewers pause and consider the profound importance of preserving the planet.
1,"This Imax documentary, a hymn to the harmony of nature, is a seductive visual tone poem that portrays a world without pain, pestilence or aggression."
0,Left me craving a little messy diversity.
1,"IMAX gives everyone a spacious window seat from which to view remote, unspoiled and starkly beautiful natural terrain in North America, Asia and Africa."
0,"In this well-intentioned celebration of nature and traditional ways of life, giant-screen images feel generic when they should inspire wonder."
1,A fine thing for families and school groups.
1,Sacred Planet is a kind of Koyaanisqatsi for kids.
1,A glorious ode to nature that dazzles with seamless visuals and an appealing world music mix.
1,A feast for the senses. It's also one from the heart.
0,"A repetitive, globe-hopping Imax project that dresses up well-known ecological truisms with pretty nature photography."
0,An Imax feature that is dazzling yet superfluous.
1,Avoids polemic in favor of simply showing the many splendors we may yet lose forever.
1,Its unvarnished look at life in the slow lane exerts a hypnotic fascination.
1,"The total effect, of course, is abject sadness as we helplessly watch each enact a unique anti-success story in an inverted reality show."
0,Stephen J. Szklarski's video documentary tracks the lives of seven young drug addicts who live in and around Union Square Park in Manhattan.
1,"To most New Yorkers, the street addicts they encounter daily are nameless and faceless, and Union Square helps to humanize them."
0,"A moving film but not, to be frank, an entirely memorable one."
0,"The film attempts to affect an air of dispassionate objectivity, but generally comes across as an exercise in exploitation."
1,"There are few surprises in Mary Tobler and Savoca's script as it progresses, but the director has always shown skill at accessing the inner lives of women."
0,"Cursed isn't a very good movie, but it's more an uninspired letdown than a flabbergasting turkey."
0,"Idiotic movie, even by werewolf standards."
0,Fails to provide either Craven's trademark chills or Williamson's trademark satirical wit.
0,Not since primitive stop-motion special effects turned Lon Chaney into the Wolf Man has a movie lycanthrope looked so unconvincing.
0,"The special effects are particularly lame, and an insult to the proud werewolf tradition of An American Werewolf in London or the even better The Howling."
0,The scariest thing about this movie is the incredible waste of once-vital talent.
0,"A third-rate effort, with a weak script, cheap-looking effects and no genuine frights."
1,"How can you not feel affectionate toward a movie that includes a line like, 'I guess there's no such thing as safe sex with a werewolf'?"
0,"A hodgepodge of false starts and dead ends, and an assault on an audience's patience (as well as on the continuity editor)."
0,"It's not bad enough to make you curse, but you are likely to laugh when you should scream, and to roll your eyes when you are meant to laugh."
0,Follows its predictable way to an ending that seems endless.
0,A fangless tale devoid of chills.
0,The Dawson's Creek sensitivity and unsatisfying effects undermine the lupine anxiety.
0,"The problem lies with Williamson's script, which feels as if it has been torn from different places and glued back together like a ransom note."
0,"Makes you long for the days when teenage werewolves were beady-eyed, slavering versions of hairy-palm jokes."
0,The scariest thing in the movie is a cameo by Scott Baio.
1,"Cursed is no Scream, but it is at least a healthy yelp."
1,A likable mix of laughs and wacky action sequences.
1,"The flick is best in its bittier moments (watch for the stellar cameos), and there's nothing to trouble the tots."
1,Director Mike Mitchell deftly blends two genres -- the high school romance and the special-effects-laden superhero comic book adaptation -- and manages to spoof yet salute both with a refreshing lack of pretension.
1,"This zippy Disney adventure-comedy asks that age-old question, 'Is there life after high school?,' and answers it with a cheerful 'Not really.'"
0,Sky High is too hopelessly contrived for its actors to be able to make it work.
1,This movie about a high school for superheroes is so good-natured and self-deprecating that it's virtually impossible to dislike the thing.
1,The creators of Sky High have their finger expertly placed on their movie's pulse.
1,The clever script finds the fun while Michael Angarano keeps the emotions real as a kid who learns that real friends don't care if you're a star.
1,Sky High is a diverting family comedy that at its best aims to be a live-action Incredibles and at its middling a live-action episode of Kim Possible.
1,"Sky High is funny, smart, energetic, subversive, and has a few substantive things to say."
1,"Smartly written and sprightly played, Sky High satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics, school-daze hijinks, and family friendly coming-of-age dramedy."
1,Harmless family comedy with welcomely loopy asides.
1,"Funny, clever and even a bit inspirational, hinting at the potential for heroism in all of us."
1,"With a crisp and snappy visual style and its smartly paced story, Sky High pulls an incredible feat in an age of dumbed-down kids comedies; it's as down-to-earth as it is super."
0,Sky High may set a record for ripping off more movies in just over an hour and a half than any other film in history.
0,The formula fizzles when you skimp on the ingredients. Sky High never achieves liftoff.
0,Takes camp to new levels of self-aware mediocrity.
1,An engaging and surprisingly sharp allegory about high-school hierarchies and adolescent growing pains.
1,"A good-natured and witty mix of two modern film genres, Sky High is classic Disney filmmaking -- fanciful, family-friendly and, most importantly, fun."
0,"Cheesy as it is, the family comedy Sky High doesn't even approximate the texture of Kraft plastic-wrapped singles."
0,"This is, indeed, another teen flick, a spotty, stodgily directed, though occasionally clever one, with several cardboard performances."
0,"The climax, which involves the homecoming dance and a death ray, is frenzied in its effort to entertain, yet ultimately underwhelming, much like the movie as a whole."
1,The movie offers good-spirited fun with a family tilt.
1,"A clever, cotton-candy- light self-parody to the superhero genre that's both effective and refreshing."
1,Surprisingly fresh and entertaining.
0,Sky High hasn't a single original idea in its bird brain.
0,"High schoolers (who are shown chugging only soda pop at a supposedly rowdy party) will rule this movie lame, though early grade-schoolers might bite."
1,Director Mike Mitchell and his writing team have a lot of fun tweaking the conventions of the contemporary teen movie.
1,My 12-year-old self would have liked this movie a lot. The 25-year-old me likes it a bit more than he cares to admit.
1,"While originality is hardly the film's strongest suit, its agreeable mix of knowing spoof and kid-pleasing fantasy makes it considerably more engaging than some of the 'straight' superhero blockbusters we've suffered recently."
0,"Constant interruptions prevent the story from building to a satisfying emotional pitch, leaving the film, like the characters, to trudge circuitously across that vast frozen tundra."
1,"The Snow Walker is not Atanarjuat, but it captures the actual scenic beauty of the North and with it, the poetic truth of brotherhood in an unforgiving land."
1,"As predicable as the annual fall of the Maple Leafs, but considerably more tragic, as traditional as the recurring scam of political patronage, but a lot more compelling, The Snow Walker is a vintage slice of Canadiana."
0,"For all the movie's impressive figure and facial modeling, as well as the superfluid humanoid motion, any depth is purely an illusion."
0,"Even in a cartoon this technically astounding, most of the characters appear to have sprung from the DNA of Astro Boy."
0,"Dazzling visually but is flattened by corny dialogue better suited to the 1936 Flash Gordon serial, a needlessly hard to follow plot and heavy-handed exposition clotted with pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo."
0,Has a plot that frolics in the no-man's land between fiendish complexity and utter incomprehensibility.
1,"Despite swaths of verbal exposition and a tendency to overdose on robot action sequences, the film has enough originality to interest demanding fans of the genre."
0,The bizarre gulf between the realism of the backgrounds and the stylization of the characters undermines a story line about a conspiracy to rid Utopia of 'bio-roids.'
0,The spectacle of the Appleseed anime characters performing Matrix gymnastics proves to be less than awe-inspiring.
0,"In the clash of 2-D and 3-D images, Appleseed emerges as the cracked-voiced, pasty-faced example of computer animation's clumsy adolescence."
0,"Yes, it looks good, but it doesn't come close to exploring the grand themes it has in mind, or to ascending anywhere near the landmarks of anime."
1,A cross-pollination of eye-popping combat and provocative ideas.
0,"The action scenes might grab you, but there's a lot of talky downtime."
0,"Though Appleseed has its selling points, it's not an especially strong entry in the genre, despite the presence of so many pneumatic heroines."
0,This long-overdue big-screen adaptation makes it hard to tell what was so revolutionary about the series.
0,Newbie viewers will be left twiddling their thumbs while waiting for Deunen's next bout of butt-kicking action sequences.
1,There is plenty to admire from a technical and artistic standpoint.
0,"It's busy, stiff, artificial graphics are a perfect match for its busy, stiff, artificial plot."
1,Shut your brain down for optimal viewing pleasure.
0,The stock characters and leaden stretches of expository dialogue are welcome evidence that there's still no computer program capable of telling a decent story.
1,Highly entertaining romp from the pen of airport pulp king Clive Cussler.
0,"Insanely busy, exceedingly long, and sometimes endearingly preposterous."
1,Eisner shows himself to be a solid helmer of complex and beautifully staged action sequences with a sure ear for character interplay and an exact eye for glorious widescreen framing with nods to images from Lawrence of Arabia.
0,A testosterone-drenched escapade that misses because it lacks the tension to make it a thrill ride.
0,It's a little hard to have silly fun when you are constantly being reminded that Hotel Rwanda and similar stories have been playing out down the road.
1,"Getting the girl, finding the gold and saving the world from a plague are just afterthoughts here. The main objective is to have fun, and in that regard, Sahara accomplishes its mission handily."
1,"A largely entertaining version of Clive Cussler's novel, with Matthew McConaughey delivering the goods as the adventurous Dirk Pitt."
0,"We flip through the usual catalog of close-call explosions, firefights and chases in which the weaponry is as lovingly photographed as the bronzed McConaughey and gorgeous Cruz."
0,Feels like a carbon copy of the real thing.
1,"If you like movies that are big, dumb fun, they don't come much bigger -- and they certainly don't come any dumber (or funner!) -- than Sahara."
1,Spectacularly silly and perversely entertaining.
1,"It may not be Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Sahara, the screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn, is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps."
1,"The film is passably entertaining, in no small part because of Steve Zahn."
0,There's no disguising the fact that Sahara has all the heft of marshmallow.
0,This is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 special.
0,Feels as plodding and fruitless as trekking the length of a desert on a pogo stick with a busted spring.
0,"What it is is a big summer action movie that would have been hot stuff about 30 years ago but looks tired and worn today despite a perky, attractive cast that refuses to wilt in the desert sun."
1,"A big, goofy, entirely disposable, tons-o-fun Hollywood Action Flick."
0,How many leaps of logic do you allow an action movie before that thin strand of suspended disbelief snaps?
0,McConaughey's no Harrison Ford. And no one cracks the whip of originality.
0,"A mediocrity wrapped inside a banality, toasted in a nice, fresh cliche."
0,"Unlike Raiders of the Lost Ark, which this movie wants so desperately to be, there's nothing here to engage the brain along with the eyeballs."
1,Entertaining but flawed popcorn fare.
0,"This one has everything: stereotyped characters, shaky camera work, absurdly inappropriate pop songs on the soundtrack, a confused tone, misplaced zaniness and a nonsensical story."
1,Let's hope today's 10-year-old boys aren't too jaded by Matrix reruns to enjoy this for the good clean fun that it is.
1,"Productions this guiltlessly corny need real personalities to sell them, and unlike the dull National Treasure, Sahara has a few."
0,"The one-liners, mostly bland, are used so liberally that they water down the action."
0,Eisner is not remotely up to the challenge. Spending millions on action scenes does not mean you get them right.
1,"It's about good ol' boys on a rip-snorting adventure, and to that end, it succeeds."
1,Stands as one more bit of throwback entertainment that's better than I expected -- and not much more.
1,"McConaughey and his co-stars make the case that fun, however fleeting, is still fun."
1,"Whatever it lacks in substance it makes up for in gloss, humor and thrills, and a good time should be had by all."
0,"Good-natured enough to entertain here and there, but that otherwise loses its way long before the characters complete their implausible quest."
1,"I enjoyed this movie on its own dumb level, which must mean (I am forced to conclude) in my own dumb way."
0,
0,It drove me crazy. It made National Treasure look like a documentary.
0,"Sahara is many things, but it is not a movie. It is the skull-splitting cacophony of 21 producers and four screenwriters (that we know about, anyway) standing in the same room shouting into their cell phones."
0,"Despite the vast beauty of location settings in Morocco and Spain, the vast lack of chemistry between the two stars is appalling."
1,A strange and rather sick movie made by highly talented people.
1,"Neither a great movie nor even a classic noir but it has a great ambition to be daring and, once seen, is not easily forgotten."
1,Scripter Jules Furthman and Director Edmund Goulding have ... seldom forgotten that the original novel they were adapting is essentially intelligent trash; and they have never forgotten that on the screen pretty exciting things can be made of trash.
0,"In the end, there's little left in that sad, cold figure at the head of the firm to compel our empathy or compassion."
1,"This relentlessly morose movie from Denmark is a sleek, desolate fable about the conflict between corporate values and human needs."
1,"Thomsen gives a fully realized, utterly plausible portrayal of a man caught in an untenable dilemma."
0,Has a promising start but soon becomes preachy and melodramatic.
0,"The second of a planned trilogy about class divisions, The Inheritance seems to say that money ruins everything. Save yours for another movie."
1,The deft understatement of the actors and the resistance of cinematic artifice make the tale all the more devastating.
1,It traces the difficult and soul-destroying choices that have to be made to transform a failing family business into a potentially monopolistic multinational corporation.
0,An initially insightful portrait of modern corporate society that unfortunately lapses into melodrama.
1,All the great emotions we're used to in the works of Ibsen and Shakespeare wash over us in bountiful flow.
1,"As it moves forward, this bleak parable of business and power teases you with possibilities."
1,"It's a poignant, even heart-rending reflection on how doing the right thing isn't as simple as we were once taught."
0,"While the entire movie is one massive flashback, the real reasons for all this Danish dysfunction go unexplored."
1,"Highly dramatic and intensely emotional, blessed with strong themes and an unstoppable narrative drive, it is adult, intelligent entertainment of a kind we rarely see these days."
1,"In his role, Thomsen is strong and convincing."
0,There's a major difference between Inheritance and The Godfather -- and that's a lack of epic and thematic sweep.
1,"What makes The Inheritance so watchable, and so different from recent couples dramas like Closer, is that these privileged people are decent, likable and struggling to do the right thing."
0,Dry interviews and soggy performances by the likes of Money Mark and Rick Wakeman of Yes don't do much to burnish Moog's legacy.
1,Offers a fascinating historical look at the technological side of the 60's revolution in pop music.
0,Somewhat cursory portrait.
0,"The doc focuses exclusively on Robert Moog, and Robert Moog is, well, kind of boring."
0,"A collection of dry interviews and so-so music, it's better suited to public TV than the big screen."
1,An affectionate portrait of Robert Moog.
1,Fjellestad exhibits a playful adoration for the man and the otherworldly sounds of his machine in an intriguing rendering of one of music technology's seminal figures.
0,"For every insight, there are a half-dozen meandering conversations and unguided reminiscences."
1,"Crash is hyper-articulate and often breathtakingly intelligent and always brazenly alive. I think it's easily the strongest American film since Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, though it is not for the fainthearted."
1,I think this is the kind of film that starts arguments and stimulates passionate discussion about topics that still make most of us cringe.
0,"Full of well-observed supporting riffs, Crash might've accumulated more frisson had it cast a clearer eye on how social tension actually plays."
1,Crash's strength is that it deals intelligently with serious subjects.
1,"Despite its preachy moments, the film is a knockout. In a multiplex starved for ambition, why kick a film with an excess of it?"
1,"Haggis knows how to grab the viewer's attention, via intense confrontations as well as by planting dramatic seeds that bear fruit in, more often than not, grimly unexpected ways."
1,"The stunning, must-see drama Crash is proof that words have not lost the ability to shock in our anesthetized society."
1,Haggis writes with such directness and such a good ear for everyday speech that the characters seem real and plausible after only a few words. His cast is uniformly strong; the actors sidestep cliches and make their characters particular.
1,Audiences may cringe as Haggis taps into the kind of offensive images that surreptitiously seep into the brains of even the most open-minded. His point is simple: No one is immune.
0,"A grim, histrionic experiment in vehicular metaphor slaughter."
1,"Lop off a few characters, tighten the narrative geometry, and Crash might have a sledgehammer impact. As it is, the film is content to tap you on the shoulder and ask you to take a look around."
0,"So much feeling, so much skill, so much seriousness, such an urgent moral agenda -- all of this must surely answer our collective hunger for a good movie, or even a great one, about race and class in a modern American city. Not even close."
1,Haggis challenges our common conceptions about race and allows no character to escape his own hypocrisy.
1,"Like that nerve-rattling collision of metal and glass, Crash will leave its audiences jarred awake, feeling bruised."
1,Crash has been crafted to deliver a wake-up blow to our complacency.
1,"A gorgeous mosaic of a movie that is actually about our fears of each other, set in the bright light of Los Angeles and the dark places in our hearts."
1,"Dark, fluid thriller seasoned with acerbic dialogue and rueful observations that may strike uncomfortably close to home."
1,"An intricate, explosive ensemble crime drama set in a modern urban pressure-cooker of racial and class hatreds."
1,"People collide as well in this literate, engrossing and occasionally funny look at race relations in Los Angeles."
1,"Haggis's drama is about much more than interlocking front-end collisions. It's about the way we learn, often badly, about one another and how it may take a bad confrontation to peel away the misperceptions."
1,"This is the rare American film really about something, and almost all the performances are riveting. It asks tough questions, and lets its audience struggle with the answers."
1,The best parts of Crash are as good as they are because they confront us with behaviour we might be capable of under the same circumstances. And we're not bad people. Are we?
0,"And so Crash raises the question: If racism is so pervasive in our society, why do we need such an elaborately contrived plot to drive home the message? In other words: How many racists does it take to screw in the point?"
1,"Crash, Paul Haggis' flawed but riveting tale of racism in contemporary Los Angeles, has moments so powerful they're instantly seared into your memory; you'll watch without blinking, barely breathing."
1,"Its emotional lows and wicked below-the-belt punches make it a soul-searching film, a manipulative movie with a lot of stars and a writer-director staying on message throughout: We need to know each other better than this."
1,"Crash isn't set half-a-century ago, in some place of dusty roads and Skoal-spitting sheriffs. It takes place now, in Los Angeles, that most modern of American cities."
0,"Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on."
1,"An ambitious and often wonderful movie, an expansive look at urban life -- the fractious, noisy whole of it -- filled with witty, biting and insightful writing."
1,"Haggis bends back one full day to unravel the tangled threads leading to the crash, and, in turn, the tangle justifies the existence of his varied and polyglot ensemble."
1,One of the finest American movies to engage our diverse richness and our casual and not-so-casual ethnic hostility.
0,"Characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do."
0,"The characters and individual dramas remain interesting in a personal way, but the overall conception of Crash is hackneyed."
1,"Cheadle serves as the movie's Greek chorus, sorting out the fender benders that serve as a metaphor for a city where, Haggis implies, racial profiling rivals moviemaking as a leading activity."
0,"Crash wants to be taken seriously as a meditation on our anxiety-plagued times, but the coincidences are too pat, the tugs on the heartstrings too insistent."
1,"What emerges from the movie's emotional fender-bending and concentrated irony are moments of awe-inspiring reach, the kind of full-throttle acting that demands attention."
1,"You will watch much of Crash in dread. That's not so much because you know things are going to get worse -- they do -- before they get better, but because you know Haggis is getting to the nut of things."
0,"The theme is racism. Let me say that again: The theme is racism. I could say it 500 more times because that's how many times the movie says it, in every single scene."
0,I found Mr. Haggis' moralistic tales too facile for my taste.
1,"The actors, especially Chris Bridges (aka rapper Ludacris), Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Michael Pe챰a, and Larenz Tate, are adroit at conveying Haggis's candid observations about the crazy ways we live and think."
1,There are some powerful scenes that have a harrowing quality.
1,Few films are as daring. Few films this year are as deserving of your attention.
0,"An already over-eventful narrative -- what, another crash? -- teeters into melodramatic implausibility."
1,Enjoy the wonderful performances by a cast very committed to the cause.
0,Any relation to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.
1,"It's smart, therefore, that Haggis has written such novel, precisely observed, often unpleasant characters as the ones Bullock, Dillon, and Cheadle inhabit."
0,"Haggis shows a lot of promise as a director: his film is never dull. But he needs to unlearn some of the bad lessons he picked up working in TV, which demands that everything be neat, symmetrical and underlined."
1,"Haggis moves seamlessly between all these stories and has structured them in such a way that his characters reach a crisis point simultaneously, followed by melancholy clarity."
1,"Ultimately, Crash succeeds in spite of itself. Its color war starts to feel obvious and schematic. Its coincidences and cliches become like a pileup on the 405 freeway, but there it is -- you find yourself rubbernecking and can't manage to look away."
1,"Instead of heartwarming messages about forgiveness, it honours ambiguity and brings us close, closer than is comfortable, in fact, to what Americans today are really thinking about one another."
0,"[Crash] is familiar enough that it slips easily into our film-watching faculty without any fuss, yet [Haggis'] handling of it -- his muscular belief in what he is doing -- makes us hope that his next screenplay will be a bit less safe."
1,"Crash is a very watchable and well-constructed piece of work, and a potential script masterclass: but its daringly supercharged fantasies of racial paranoia and humanist redemption are not to be taken too seriously."
1,"The script is clever, the racial theme is worthy of Newsnight, and the editing just sublime."
1,"Set in a simmering cauldron of racial tensions where subtle nuance can cut as deep as unambiguous hostility, it's a powerful drama about the often bewildering contradictions that underlie human behaviour."
0,It's just a chilly trip to the heart of nothing.
0,
0,"So...why remake this, again?"
1,Just funny enough to mollify purists and amuse the uninitiated.
0,"Cedric and Epps have none of the team chemistry Gleason shared with Art Carney, and Epps' Norton displays none of Carney's eccentricities."
0,"It's as if whenever The Honeymooners comes close to delivering on a funny idea, the movie runs screaming in the opposite direction."
1,"A surprise and a delight, a movie that escapes the fate of weary TV retreads and creates characters that remember the originals, yes, but also stand on their own."
1,"Superfluous though it may be, The Honeymooners is not so bad."
0,"Though the patterns are there, the laughs aren't, mostly because the writing is so lazy and formulaic."
0,"This laughless attempt to modernize the Kramdens and Nortons is somewhat akin to sacrilege, as it waters down the characters and strips them of their unforgettable quirks and tics."
0,"Not only an insult to the original, it should be shown at film schools as proof of how pointless a movie can be."
0,"A lackluster affair, devoid of laughs and just about anything else one might construe as entertainment."
0,"What The Honeymooners does well, it does very well. The trouble is, it doesn't do enough of what it does well."
0,"A get-rich-quick picture about a guy with get-rich-quick dreams. The moon may shine high over Ralph Kramden's New York City, but sights are set depressingly low in the studio schemes of Hollywood."
0,John Leguizamo steals the show as its sleazy trainer -- not that there's much to steal from John Schultz's joylessly schematic paycheck.
0,"There's plenty of space up there for a colony of mediocre filmmakers. That's right, folks. To the moon. Bang! Zoom!"
0,"Blame it all on the Bad Guys, those Hollywood suits who think by committee and never met a focus group they didn't like. This is product, pure and simple."
0,"The lunar destination aims far too high. This misbegotten movie heads straight for the dogs and the sewer, literally so."
1,"Cedric the Entertainer comes close to sharing Gleason's gift for, well, entertaining. He's the biggest reason this version of The Honeymooners is such an amusing surprise."
0,"Cannibalizing old programs has become a reflex action in Tinseltown, and as a result, audience expectations are low. It must be hard to resist the temptation to live down to them."
0,The gags in this don't just feel played. They're exhausted.
0,The funny stuff is too scattered to forgive the buffoonish storyline.
0,"A bland, dull and only occasionally funny waste of time that will very soon be gathering dust in the remainder bins."
0,The honeymoon is over.
0,"Why? Why would someone do this? How did we get here, watching mediocre remakes of classic 1950s sitcoms? What is the meaning of it all? Does cinema have a purpose beyond supporting the theater-concessions industry?"
0,"If not for a few interludes of lively riffing by John Leguizamo, playing a dog trainer and all-around hustler named Dodge, there would be nothing funny about any of this."
0,[Has] a script that never answers a key question: Why does this movie exist?
1,There have been funnier comedies. But there also have been far worse reasons to make a movie. Or remake a sitcom.
0,The best thing that can be said about the new Honeymooners is that it respects its elders: It plays like an episode of the show. The worst thing is that it plays like an episode of the show.
0,"It's as if the movie is half Honeymooners remake and half typical weak comedy, which doesn't add up to a whole lot of anything."
0,"It's not as bad as the average Hollywood movie, it's stupendously worse."
0,"I like the cast. They're very talented, they're really funny, they have a dreadful script to work with."
0,"The real problem is that the Kramdens' precarious financial situation, which gave the original its poignant frisson, is sidestepped."
0,"The comedy wannabe has the lamest, most predictable banter of any recent movie."
0,It could be part-autobiographical for director John Schultz who blunders through a tediously half-baked plot and fails to make it pay off.
0,"The stars are asked to chew on the driest of technobabble, and to strike poses of flyboy and flygirl moxie that make them look callow rather than heroic."
0,"A slick piece of summer entertainment that is counting on elaborate special effects to make its derivative, convoluted story line all but irrelevant."
0,The dialogue is often drowned out by engine noise.
0,Has the makings of a kitsch classic.
0,The movie does deliver the video game goods but strands its characters in a no-man's-land of crude characterizations and silly dialogue.
0,"It ain't brain surgery, but Stealth is one of the smartest stupid movies of the summer."
0,The movie is absolutely consistent -- it's just as wildly improbable at the end as in the beginning.
0,"Stealth's strengths are obvious -- high-tech marvels and a good cast -- so are its flaws. At its worst moments, a mad robot seems to have taken over the movie, too."
0,"If Stealth were a recruitment film for aircraft-carrier duty, one would be tempted to say, 'Mission accomplished.' As a feature film, it's a washout."
0,"After 110 minutes of this, atheists will storm monasteries and acrophobics will scale redwood trees, anything to find an oasis of calm."
0,"Stealth is a offense against taste, intelligence and the noise pollution code -- a dumbed-down Top Gun crossed with the HAL 9000 plot from 2001."
0,"Move over, Michael Bay. The Island is no longer the loudest, dumbest movie of the summer."
0,"Overlong, disjointed, and rarely compelling, Stealth has the capacity to put viewers into a catatonic state."
0,It's not new. It's not interesting. I wish it would go away.
0,"Aiming to join the Jerry BruckheimerJerry Bruckheimer/Michael BayMichael Bay school of American movie war games, Stealth is just too dumb to make the grade."
0,Stealth manages to be so ridiculously unconvincing you think you're watching a live-action version of last year's sublime action-movie puppet satire Team America.
0,"Rob Cohen's airborne adventure Stealth commits the cardinal sin for an action movie: It's very, very dull."
0,"No matter how hard Cohen flogs it, whips it, beats it, shakes it, kicks it and prods it with a sharp stick, Stealth, his latest, just doesn't spring to life."
0,"Stealth flirts with competence when it reprises Behind Enemy Lines, and staggers into hilarious ineptitude when it borrows from 2001: A Space Odyssey."
0,"Harsh and tasteless, it doesn't even qualify as a popcorn movie. Popcorn, at least, has some taste to it, and a certain airiness."
0,Stealth succeeds in satisfying a dozen different pubescent fantasies while simultaneously violating every aspect of logic and good taste.
0,"Beyond mind-numbing explosions, Stealth's effects are good, especially the whooshing flight scenes. But as Eddie shows, humanity matters, and computer wizardry won't fill an empty plot."
0,"Cohen is no stranger to cornball excess but Stealth is his chef-d'oeuvre, a movie so audaciously preposterous and jingoistic it plays like a parody of the genre."
0,"[Stealth] is the filmic embodiment of all that is indulgent, gratuitous and downright dumb in pop culture."
0,Stealth doesn't so much crash and burn as just fly and fade into its CGI-created sunset.
1,Hollywood hokum? Absolutely. Pop-culture propaganda? Perhaps. Yet Stealth goes beyond feeding our popcorn proclivities.
0,Stealth is a pretty fair military-hardware action movie until you start thinking about it -- at which point it turns incredibly sour in your mouth.
0,"Stealth is so over-painted with CGI that it doesn't look as real as the sequence starring Shepard that inspired it in The Right Stuff, a movie made with model airplanes."
0,"The latest and, in many ways, most preposterous hunk of big-screen action to come out of Hollywood in some time."
0,"Stealth is flimsy and forgettable, but it does have a few worthy action and special-effects sequences."
0,Cohen undermines his own effort to make a 21st century Top Gun by using so many quick cuts and zooms that we can't even appreciate the action sequences. I almost got motion sickness.
0,"If we're going to be fighting the war on terror in perpetuity, could we at least get better movies out of it?"
1,"Full of explosive mayhem and pulse-quickening aerial combat, this high-flying action romp offers polished, if derivative entertainment."
1,A document that will satiate Dylan fans over repeated viewings and should bring naysayers into the Dylan fold.
1,"Creates a portrait that is deep, sympathetic, perceptive and yet finally leaves Dylan shrouded in mystery, which is where he properly lives."
1,"To narrate selected details from this journey from the Iron Range to Greenwich Village to Rock Star Babylon, we get generous, attention-span respecting clips of Dylan performances and reminiscences from carefully selected talking heads."
1,As good as it gets in music documentaries.
1,... Martin Scorsese has finally gotten around to doing for Bob Dylan what he did for the Band back in 1978.
0,"Fans of Bob Dylan and others ambitious enough to sit through ""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan"" will discover early on that it yields no revelatory light to speak of on its subject."
0,the film's real problem is Roeg's willingness to sacrifice the logic of situation and character to facile shock effects.
0,"Since the brief but fairly blunt sex scenes earned the movie an X rating anyway, it seems even more self-defeating to choose a leading man incapable of projecting a forceful sexuality."
0,"This film has been praised for its honesty, but it would have taken far more honesty (not to mention courage) to deal with the personality disorders of these characters instead of simply burying them in blood, sex, and noise."
1,"Its ecological concerns, nuance and occasional lyricism place it squarely within the Ghibli oeuvre but not among its masterpieces."
0,"Kruger's surprise ending fails to pack the kind of wallop to justify the momentary head-scratching, while there are too few moments leading up to the big reveal that will give audiences the kind of jolt they're expecting."
0,The Skeleton Key is unable to ward off the nasty spirits of formula screenwriting.
0,Only die-hard Hudson fans or desperate horror junkies will find The Skeleton Key worth unlocking.
0,"Creaky in its mechanics and numbingly protracted, this is basement B horror that fancies itself a prestige chiller."
1,"For anyone zombified by creaky thriller cliches, Skeleton is a fine little shot in the head."
1,Tightly plotted and suspenseful enough to keep you guessing.
1,"One of the most enjoyably inane movies of the season, this faux Southern Gothic offers an embarrassment of geek pleasures."
0,"Even with all its florid melodrama, The Skeleton Key seems slow as molasses and not nearly as tasty."
0,Serviceable but ultimately disappointing.
0,"The Skeleton Key is more creaky than creepy, like visiting an expensive haunted house."
0,[The ending] doesn't quite compensate for the predictable hokum that precedes it.
0,A gumbo of silly mumbo-jumbo no more frightening than a Mardi Gras mask.
0,"The Skeleton Key is one of those movies that explains too much while it is explaining too little, and leaves us with a surprise at the end that makes more sense the less we think about it. But the movie's mastery of technique makes up for a lot."
0,The Hollywood cliche factory got its mojo working overtime on this one.
0,The Skeleton Key delivers its share of cheap scares but never unlocks the door to the creepiness that would have made this is memorable movie-going experience.
0,"The Skeleton Key delivers on all formulaic counts, except one: It never serves up any truly nightmare-inspiring scares."
1,"A diverting, stylish thriller that, despite pivoting on that and other whoppers, deserves credit for creating an authentic, original vibe."
0,This is essentially a haunted-house horror flick that starts off with effectively eerie scenes but devolves into a forced and mildly ridiculous ghost story.
0,Criminal waste of talent.
0,"There's lots of bad stuff brewing on the bayou in this occasionally scary but more often silly movie, which wastes some good actors along the way."
0,A well-intentioned horror film that is weighted down by stellar cast members who for the most part act as if they don't want to be there.
0,"The film offers a rich gumbo of menace, mystery and magic - and then lets it go cold and mushy in a rainstorm of Hollywood haunted-house huggermugger."
1,The Skeleton Key is a hoodoo puzzle that's more interesting than scary.
0,"It's basically Rosemary's Baby, Cajun style, with a pinch of Amityville Horror for kick."
0,The Skeleton Key is strictly summer schlock.
0,"Though the story is as creaky as a plantation porch, Iain Softley's lushly atmospheric The Skeleton Key does offer a few nifty twists on the classic 'woman in peril' picture."
0,"Neither scary nor thrilling, although it's reasonably entertaining despite an abundance of haunted-house cliches, the usual inexplicable scary-movie behavior and an almost-naked John Hurt."
0,"A formulaic fear-fest with a bare-bones plot, The Skeleton Key is more moody than scary, and Hudson's heroine is unsympathetic."
0,A stylishly made but disappointingly lightweight psychological horror tale set in the bayou.
0,A pretty good movie.
0,"The Skeleton Key looks great and oozes atmosphere, but unfortunately it's the atmosphere of hundreds of haunted house movies before it."
0,The movie ultimately comes off as a kind of wannabe that doesn't get where it wants to go.
1,The Skeleton Key opens a very different door into its tale of black magic in a Louisiana plantation home.
0,This nasty little movie is communicating with regional and racial cliches from beyond the grave.
1,"This is a moody, creepy thriller with some genuinely scary moments and a couple of twists that took me completely by surprise."
1,"It pulls just about every nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat trick imaginable, yet gets away with it through what is, admittedly, a clever and original gimmick."
0,"Red Eye relies on hoodwinking an audience with its tension, so that the sheer illogic of the conspiracy plot can slip by without detection."
1,"Craven's terror-alert white-knuckler is a zippy, unpretentious entry in the subgenre, hinging on the enforced proximity of cat and mouse."
1,"A good measure of the movie's white-knuckle fun comes from Craven's old-hand familiarity with the way thrillers tick, predicated on the smallest and most banal of missed connections, the kind that get an audience to go crazy."
1,"A movie that, like its heroine, is lithe, limber and quick-thinking. Like a triple latte from the airport Starbucks, Red Eye will keep you awake, jittery and perched on the edge of your seat for pretty much the entire flight."
0,There are enough thrills during the final third to give Red Eye viewers a few of Craven's patented jolts near the end. But it requires forbearance for both a silly script and uneven pacing to get to that point.
1,"This nifty, tense thriller directed by Wes Craven brings together a classic setup and a relevant-sounding if thoroughly undercooked story involving worldwide terrorism."
1,"It's encouraging that Craven cast two relative newcomers who are excited about being in the film, rather than stale stars earning a paycheck."
1,Red-Eye is the work of a filmmaker in command of the full resources of the camera in telling a story visually and with economy.
1,"Craven, an old hand at menace, shifts gears smoothly from the slasher parodies of Scream, offering a more subdued brand of suspense."
1,"[A] brisk, efficient B movie."
1,"Preposterous, to be sure. And the credibility gap only widens as Jack's lethal mission nears its consummation. But by that point, Craven already has us in the palm of his hand, smooth-talking us with a finesse worthy of his dashing villain."
1,A nifty thriller that plays like B-movie blast from the past.
1,A minimalist exercise in maximalist suspense.
1,"Fast and furious and tightly focused and blessedly short at 85 minutes, it recalls not so much today's bloated, computer-crazed films, but tighter melodramas of the '50s."
1,Red Eye doesn't just stick to the basics -- it reminds us why they still matter.
1,[Craven finds] another new way to stoke our apprehensions of being caught vulnerable and helpless.
1,"An immensely dumb, immensely fun thriller."
1,A film that delivers high tension without the baggage of postmodern irony.
1,"Teach this one in film schools. Maybe it could save us from all those stupid, nobody-would-do-that plot turns, flaccid formula screenwriting and thrillers that run so long they lose their thrills."
1,"The movie is a pleasant surprise at the end of summer, and an exciting detour from one of the most influential directors of horror films."
1,An airborne suspense thriller that terrifies with a smile.
0,"Once the plane touches land, things go downhill. The movie devolves into a by-the-book action flick."
1,"In short, Red Eye hits the bull's-eye."
1,"This is a sophisticated genre movie, and it's effective on many levels."
1,"If you can sit back, buckle up and forgive the plot holes on its runway, Craven's bumpy ride is rollicking entertainment, careening from winking humor and cutting dialogue to big action payoffs."
1,"Sitting through Red Eye is like watching a master carpenter at work on a custom bookcase. No one would call the result art, but you're sure bound to admire the sheer craft of the thing."
1,"Rare these days is the thriller that takes its time, allowing us to get comfortable with the characters and the characters to get comfortable with one another before starting the chase or inducing the shocks."
1,"There are no dinosaurs, starships, monsters or special effects involved. Just two humans pressed too close to one another, locked in a fight for survival. What could be more frightening?"
1,"If you can suspend enough disbelief to follow a plot that sacrifices itself on an altar of cheap, end-of-picture thrills, you'll get your money's worth."
1,"Briskly paced, it takes less time than a flight from Denver to L.A. It may not be a classic, but it's way more satisfying than a mini-bag of pretzels and a soda."
0,A one-trick action thriller that feels like a poor cousin of an episode of 24.
1,Red Eye proves once again that imaginative wrapping enhances any package's appeal.
1,"After a summer of crashes, bangs, endless chase scenes and special effects that belittle the actors standing in front of them, what a pleasure to see characters in a thriller doing what people like themselves possibly could do."
1,"It took forever, but the best thriller of summer 2005 has finally arrived. The gripping, seat- clutching suspense in this baby will pin you to your seat."
1,"For Wes Craven, who I like a lot as a slasher director, he really goes into a different direction with this."
1,"Rare these days is the thriller that takes its time, allowing us to get comfortable with the characters before starting the chase or inducing the shocks."
1,A classy thriller that scoots along at breakneck speed.
1,The movie turns into a complicated duel that depends on precise observation of physical detail and moment-by-moment continuity so closely calibrated that it's impossible to find a wasted shot or an exaggerated emotion.
1,"I'm not claiming masterpiece stature for Red Eye, just a solid professionalism in the acting, writing and direction that seems inextricably related to the modesty of its intentions."
1,"If constructing a thriller could be likened to building a house, then Wes Craven's Red Eye is a perfect piece of architecture: It's clean-lined and soundly structured, without a foot of wasted space or any materials left unused."
1,"The psychological mind-games are played to the hilt, the pressurised cabin air increases the edge-of-the-seat tension and the 85-minute flight time is gratifyingly short."
1,A powerful piece of cinema.
1,An eye-opener about the true dimensions -- both physical and mental -- of the barrier being built to divide Palestinian territories from Israel.
1,Disturbing and compelling.
1,A film that considers hard-core political realities alongside agonizing personal truths.
1,An important human and artistic testament -- a calm meditation on something no one can consider calmly.
0,[A] tedious left-wing documentary.
1,There's no denying the power of seeing two cultures standing so helplessly on opposite sides of a single fence.
1,"[A] stately, outraged partisan nonfiction film."
1,A deeply personal and unexpectedly poetic film.
0,"While all this might have made for a potent short subject, the abstract visual monotony begins to wear thin shortly into the 98-minute running time."
0,"Bitton poses the important questions, but too often she lets powerful responses get lost amid footage that lingers forever on some mundane location shot while interviews are happening mostly off camera."
0,"This Special Jury Prize winner at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival has its doubts, rather too tentatively expressed, and its arguments might have been bolstered by considering the recent history of all the other architecture in the killing fields..."
1,"A needlessly circuitous plot twist leaves a bitter taste, but not before the film's scruffy charm does its work."
1,"Lough's impressive, if uneven, debut feature captures the adrenaline rush and contradictory nature of the simultaneously creative and criminal activity but stumbles in its attempt to justify it as an art form."
1,Adam Bhala Lough's hot little melodrama rhapsodizes the lives of contemporary graffiti artists.
0,"Lough references Basquiat, without naming him, but in the end can't quite hijack the late artist's cred for his own hit-and-run movie."
0,"Preachy and single-minded, populated by a world of sympathetic heroes and hissable villains."
0,"A mild, slow-moving drama that belatedly tries to argue that graffiti writers are political artists, not an urban blight."
1,A richly textured drama with an angry poetic edge that gets inside the obsessive subculture of New York graffiti artists.
1,"Notable mainly for its hallucinatory, tripped visuals, which go a long way toward compensating for a less-than-riveting narrative."
0,"Thoroughly fails to convince that its handful of New York characters known as 'bombers,' graffiti mongers futilely yearning for immortality via nightly despoiling of public and private property, is of any tragic interest."
0,Visually dazzling and dramatically trite -- it's virtuoso piffle.
0,The scariest thing about Hellbent is that somebody thought making this humorless gaysploitation slasher flick would be a good idea.
1,Aa hard-charging horror movie with a clever gay twist.
1,HellBent is frank enough in its depiction of gay male sexuality to make many in the general moviegoing audience squirm and just self-mocking enough to make its target audience laugh.
1,"Has both novelty and back-to-basics ingenuity in its favor, along with memorable characters and the deft combination of gory shocks and comic relief that's essential to the genre."
0,Writer-director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts doesn't know how to create anything resembling suspense.
0,"Either it's a truly lousy retread of horror-movie clich챕s, or it's a mildly amusing sendup of them."
1,"Because more time is dedicated to crafting authentic, sympathetic characters than the average horror movie, it's easier to overlook the film's often-corny dialogue and so-so special effects."
0,"If audiences have been waiting for a gay slasher film, their wait might be over, but their appetite will not be sated."
0,"This isn't a particularly good movie, and it's offensive in the way mid-range low-budget slasher shows usually are. But it works better than some."
0,The horror in the film is mediocre at best.
0,"A loyal gay audience may appreciate the novelty, but horror fans can find junk like this lining the shelves of any video store."
0,
0,"A genre cheapie from its digital-video camerawork to its Casiotone soundtrack to its bland, buff cast, the movie is a cultural watershed in a dry gulch."
1,"Smartly directed by Jim Gillespie from a script by various hands, Venom ... follows its stylish, energetic and darkly amusing horror movie tradition."
0,"Venom is a horror film full of swampy Southern atmosphere and voodoo creepiness. Unfortunately, it comes after The Skeleton Key, which mined the same territory and did it with more imagination and style."
0,"Venom reprises all the tedium of slasher flicks, from the idiots who scream and trip and fall rather than simply run away to the macho killer who can't be stopped. There's no antidote for that."
0,"As unconvincing and unrealistic as one of those ridiculous made-for-cable 'horror' films on USA Network, the kind starring Tom Wopat or Timothy Busfield."
0,"Jim Gillespie (I Know What You Did Last Summer) directs and while one might naively believe that the absence of Jennifer Love Hewitt would in itself predict an advance in moviemaking, one would be sadly mistaken."
1,[Director Jim Gillespie] seems to understand the genre better than the clueless who've been delivering recent Hollywood superschlock remakes like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and House of Wax.
1,"As mindless scare machines go, Dimension Films' bayou-set slasher thriller acquits itself well enough. Gratuitously gory and derivative to the core, Venom manages to deliver some effective frights in between large swaths of voodoo gibberish."
0,"Even the title is lame, but it does convey the movie's overall effect: numbing and toxic."
0,"There's nothing clever about this movie. It starts too slow, plot points are abandoned and even the killings start to run together."
0,"Venom certainly can't be called a good movie, but within the horror genre it's perfectly palatable."
0,"It seems like all of the filmmaker's creative energy was channeled into the gory imagery, while thematic linkage was an afterthought. Venom has a meandering story to match its misleading title."
0,"Even the undemanding high schoolers the film is aimed at will experience d챕j횪 voodoo, as Venom recites the A through Z of horror clich챕s. All hopes for suspense and plot twists are snuffed out about as quickly as the film's black characters."
0,"A witless, derivative slasher flick."
0,"If you saw House of Wax you've already seen the same basic premise executed with more skill, + had the unspeakable joy of watching Paris Hilton get skewered. Venom, alas, can't afford Paris Hilton."
0,"Though not meant to be taken seriously, Venom is no chucklefest but rather a harrowing ordeal in the ruthlessly violent vein of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
0,Venom is even more pointless than most supernatural slasher movies.
0,Venom is so far beneath comparisons to Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer that it would have to add a Jennifer Love Hewitt cameo just to keep company with the worst sequels of those popular movies.
0,"Even by the standards of the current Miramax fire sale, this misbegotten horror film deserved to go direct to video. Or cable. Or oblivion."
0,A mud-simple horror trudge set in a swamp colony of Abercrombie models.
0,"The slasher clich챕s on reshuffle are old enough to predate the births of most of the flick's nubile victims-to-be, including tight-T-shirt wearer Agnes Bruckner."
0,"This straight-up slasher flick probably should have gone straight to video for the cheesy-looking, computer-generated snakes alone."
1,"The mesmerizing performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the celebrated writer dominates every scene, while director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman's penetrating study enthralls in every aspect."
1,An exceptional movie that digs deeply into an artist at the height of his creativity.
1,"Philip Seymour Hoffman gets it perfect in Capote, with a star turn both meteoric and mesmerizing. This is not an example of a fine actor bringing charisma to a movie. Lock, stock and barrel, he is the movie."
1,Hoffman's unmissable and unforgettable performance as Truman Capote should make him the front-runner for every Best Actor prize in the book.
1,Bennett Miller's film is a fascinating and fine-grained reconstruction of the period in which Truman Capote wrote In Cold Blood.
1,Acting doesn't get much better than Philip Seymour Hoffman's acid-etched -- yet oddly poetic -- portrait of Truman Capote.
1,[Capote] will demand recognition at next year's Oscars.
1,"It teases, fascinates, and haunts."
1,Hoffman captures what is presented as an astonishing capacity for insinuation and connects it to a deep personal understanding of the basic human need for connection.
1,"An absorbing, emotionally challenging movie out of the dubious process (in terms of dramatic potential) of literary legwork."
1,I don't think I've ever seen another performance based on a famous artist that was as psychologically acute or troubling.
1,Hoffman goes beyond the surface mannerisms and diction. He disappears into Capote.
1,It's Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals the show. Steals? He owns it outright.
1,"The movie is both ruthlessly critical of its subject and unabashedly affectionate toward him, and Hoffman hits every note so it rings true."
1,Hoffman delivers a thrilling and profound Oscar-caliber performance that will haunt viewers well after the movie is over.
1,A devastating portrait of genius and narcissism.
1,"Let me put this bluntly: Capote is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year."
1,"Small-scaled and limited, Capote is nevertheless the most intelligent, detailed, and absorbing film ever made about a writer's working method and character -- in this case, a mixed quiver of strength, guile, malice, and mendacity."
1,It's a great film.
1,"Capote is a surprisingly effective and satisfying effort. Hoffman's success in the role goes way beyond the rightness of his casting, just as the movie's triumph goes well beyond Hoffman's tour de force performance."
1,"Miller's Capote, from a screenplay by Dan Futterman, has been rightly hailed for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny reincarnation of the late Truman Capote."
1,When it's good -- which is very often -- Capote remembers what Capote forgot: Beware the reporter who thinks he's the story.
1,As entertaining as it is insightful.
1,"It's about as close as film can come to capturing a man as he gradually loses all bearings and joy. At these moments, it's hard to look at Capote. But it's even harder to turn away."
1,"It is exceptional in every sharp-eyed, low-keyed detail."
1,"The genius of the film, besides Hoffman's stunning performance, is that it knows exactly how much is enough. It never overplays, lingers or punches up."
1,"The great strength of Miller's film -- aside from Hoffman's brilliant portrayal -- is that it both tells the story behind Capote's masterpiece, the true-crime tale In Cold Blood, and serves as an homage to it."
1,Engages both the practical and the moral implications of Capote's achievement.
1,"Hoffman ... has always been an actor whose performances, no matter how small, leave a permanent impression. But his portrayal of Capote is in an entirely different league."
1,"Capote might be the best movie ever made about the complex relationship between a serious writer and a vulnerable, though not guiltless, subject."
1,Hoffman and company make Capote well worth seeing. What makes the movie important is the way Capote exposes the work of journalism.
1,Capote is a film of uncommon strength and insight.
1,"This spare, uncompromising portrait not only examines what drove the author but delves into the ethics of journalists who identify with their subjects, or pretend to, in order to report their stories."
1,The almost perfectly realized Capote -- stumbling only in the lack of shading it gives Keener's and Greenwood's characters -- offers a sobering glimpse at what the author had to give up of his soul to achieve his success.
1,A meditation on the artist's obligations to the art and to society and lines that blur when you cross them.
1,It's a fully realized look at a time and place as well as a riveting study of career obsessions warring with a sense of justice.
1,"I came in expecting Hoffman's tour de force and left with a fuller appreciation of the quiet yet lethal film around him. Lethal, because what it says about the writer's craft, about what often gets destroyed in the name of creation."
1,It is complex and thoughtful and tragic in the end. And it is certainly one of the best movies of the year.
1,"The best movie about journalism since All the President's Men, and one of the best films about writing ever made."
1,Hoffman goes beyond impersonation to something close to possession.
1,Skillfully and economically put together.
1,Capote is a cool and polished hall of mirrors reflecting the ways in which Truman Capote came to write (and be written by) In Cold Blood.
1,"It's the acting that sings, especially when Hoffman duets with luminous Catherine Keener, the lady with the loveliest laugh in film. Hoffman's writer is a self-serving egoist; Keener's a restrained, wise soul."
1,"Though the episodic structure results in a whole not quite equal to some of its parts, pic is an unusually tender, perceptive character study buoyed by stellar performances from a who's who of talented (and many underused) actresses."
0,"The short-story glimpses aim for Carver-esque pang, though the script could have used some Lorrie Moore bite."
1,"Although each character holds the spotlight only briefly, she arrives as if with a life already in progress, and it's easy to believe that she'll keep busy even after the credits roll."
1,An extraordinarily rich and satisfying suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women.
1,"A sophisticated, elegant-looking film shot in distinctive, wide-ranging L.A. locales, but its real terrain is the human heart, explored with compassion and respect."
1,A fascinating series of vignettes.
0,"For a film centered on connection and continuity, Nine Lives is curiously erratic."
0,"The bad stories waste your time, and the good ones leave you unsatisfied."
1,I thought this was a great film.
1,"The greatest short story writers, like William Trevor and Alice Munro, can awe us; their stories are short but not small. Here Rodrigo Garcia does the same thing."
1,The cumulative effect of the rigorously controlled and purposive camera style adds up in the end to a collective portrait of womankind that is greater than the sum of its parts.
1,"As delicately and precisely constructed as a spider's web, Nine Lives is a quiet triumph."
1,"It feels like real life, in nine acts."
1,"The cast steps up, embracing the chance to exercise acting chops normally limited to live theater. Most do so resoundingly, but two stand out: Robin Wright Penn and Jason Isaacs."
1,"In looking at the lives of nine very different women, Garcia often seems to be closing in on something essential, small suggestive moments that attempt to resonate with meaning. Some do. Some don't."
1,"Not all of Nine Lives clicks, but at its best it finds an inarticulate sisterly solace that makes you want to see what this director could do with one life per film."
1,A disturbingly frank look at people and relationships in contemporary Los Angeles and a thrilling dramatic showcase for a brilliant cast.
0,"What's the point? If I wanted to spend 12 minutes watching someone pushing a cart around a grocery store, I'd go to the local A&P, not sit in a movie theater."
1,"The moments that Garcia has chosen to observe are unforgettable, the women -- played by an ensemble of actresses at the top of their respective games -- indelible."
1,[Garcia] leaves you thinking deeply about these people. And leaves you wanting more.
1,"Composed of nine short films, each starring some of the best female actors working, though many of them aren't working enough."
1,"Nine Lives is an elegant film of quick, tour-de-force acting turns, a simple actor's gesture that tells you more than four pages of dialogue, a movie that demands concentration but that rewards the viewer willing to pay attention."
1,"If only every women's movie had Nine Lives' fire, intelligence, and conviction, they wouldn't have such a shaky reputation in the first place."
1,"Some parts are stronger than others, but as a fleshed-out artistic vision, Nine Lives works remarkably well."
1,"The stories are sketches, often without resolution, and while individual segments succeed admirably, taken together the portraits are a fitful match."
1,Each woman has to turn herself inside out in continuous time. It has the demands of theatre and the intimacy of cinema.
1,Festival will surely tickle your funny bone.
1,"A vital chapter of mid-century history is brought to life concisely, with intimacy and matter-of-fact artistry."
1,[A] gripping slice-of-life docudrama.
1,"This is a mesmerizing film from start to finish, directed by Mr. Clooney with admirable self-assurance, and a miraculous 90 minutes."
1,"George Clooney's film about the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow is a passionate, thoughtful essay on power, truth-telling and responsibility."
1,By far the smartest American film released in 2005.
1,"This is serious grown-up entertainment with a sense of history and a sense of style, the kind of picture almost no one knows how to - - or, perhaps more accurately, can find the means to - - make anymore."
1,The biggest little movie of the year -- and one of the best ever about the news media.
1,"In ninety-three tight, terrifically exciting minutes, Clooney makes integrity look mighty sexy."
1,"Clooney's account of Murrow's historic assaults on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, in 1954, imitates many of Murrow's best qualities."
1,"Clooney's brilliantly orchestrated and seriously respectful movie can be seen as a grim shoulder tap, lamenting the social irresponsibility of what Gore Vidal likes to call the 'United States of Amnesia.'"
1,"In his second outing as a director, Clooney expertly evokes the revved, split-second drama of the early days of live TV."
1,"Good Night, and Good Luck couldn't be more unlikely, more unfashionable -- or more compelling."
0,"The film, therefore, is like a child's view of these events, untroubled by complexity, hungry for myth and simplicity."
1,"George Clooney's second directorial outing couldn't be more topical, though the events it chronicles occurred over half a century ago."
1,"Part drama and part civics lesson, Good Night, and Good Luck is an entertaining slice of American political and cultural history."
1,"Good Night, and Good Luck says two things, at least, and they are worth repeating: There is always the chance for one good man to make a difference. And in 1954, Edward R. Murrow did."
1,A passionate and rousing piece of filmmaking -- a civics lesson with the punch of a good melodrama.
1,"Good Night, and Good Luck will probably need a little bit of luck (and good word-of-mouth) to succeed, but seek it out: It's a terrific film."
1,A hermetically sealed period piece so intensely relevant to our current state of affairs that it takes your breath away.
1,A merely good movie.
1,Strathairn's Murrow is poised at the center of this quiet whirlwind and this 'actor's actor' deftly weaves many aspects of the broadcaster's mercurial personality within the movie's tight time frame.
1,I found it to be one of most intelligent and insightful movies ever made about the television news business and about the profoundly un-American practice of labeling dissenters as traitors.
1,"Mr. Clooney doesn't sacrifice story and theme for sermonizing, which is perhaps Good Night's most impressive feat."
1,"Clooney, who gained weight to play Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, has made a solid film and his sense of humor remains intact."
1,"We're not sure if Strathairn is playing Murrow or channeling him. Either way, we're impressed."
1,Stirring yet understated.
1,"Part docu-drama, part thriller, and part cautionary tale, the movie offers something to everyone who craves more than escapism from the cinema."
1,Clooney makes an elegant argument that something of vital interest is still at stake in this story. It would take a stubborn soul to disagree.
1,"Good Night, and Good Luck stands, tall, solid, impressive and expressive joining not only the best films about journalism, but also those about real Americans."
1,"The sad conclusion of Good Night is that while we have made no more room for Murrows in this world, the potential for McCarthys lingers. In which case, good luck indeed."
1,"As an actor, George Clooney is often compared with vintage stars like Cary Grant, but with his latest work he aligns himself with history's great directors."
1,"There's no sense of nostalgia to the picture, no wistful romanticism or longing. Instead, the movie has a steely, dead-serious vitality -- a sense of immediacy and urgency that makes it seem it could be happening right now."
1,"Do you respect the corporate line or do you cross it? Clooney, who in his life wears the hats both of the entertainer and the 'actorvist,' gives us an intelligent, electric film that knows this question is as timely now as it was for Murrow."
1,"See it, to see what the news once was -- and to see what movies can be."
1,"I'm betting David Strathairn, who plays Murrow with a sense of wry self-awareness, will be nominated for an Academy Award."
1,"Mr. Strathairn does capture much of Murrow's formal manner, particularly the measured cadences of his sentences."
1,A sleek broadcast journalism procedural.
1,"The best film of the year. More important, it's one of the most patriotic movies ever made."
1,"The bottom line on Good Night, and Good Luck? See it. Now."
1,"Clooney's message is clear: Character assassination is wrong, McCarthy was a bully and a liar, and we must be vigilant when the emperor has no clothes and wraps himself in the flag."
1,"Clooney continues to improve as both a writer and director, showing huge advancement from his underwhelming 2002 helming debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."
1,"Good Night, and Good Luck may be simplified history, but it's almost consistently well-crafted."
0,"It's an interesting way to represent the past, though the use of space, actors, and archival footage seems more theatrical than cinematic."
1,"Rarely moving a facial muscle except to exhale smoke and brimstone, Strathairn wonderfully recaptures Murrow's deadpan delivery style."
1,... it telescopes -- with no loss of accuracy -- Murrow's last few fifties hurrahs as the hardest diamond in Bill Paley's 'Tiffany network.'
1,"A clever, quietly spoken little movie and a great pleasure to watch."
1,It is all outstandingly performed and photographed.
1,"It's a modest but powerful affair, and a fantastic mood piece."
1,That it's a film both timely and timeless goes without saying. Yet Clooney is too canny a storyteller to let didacticism obscure the complexities of Murrow's character.
1,A solid achievement.
1,"In terms of historical content, the film is neither quite honest nor quite true. That's a shame, because it's a great film."
0,Proceeds to rip off every teen flick from Heathers to Napoleon Dynamite.
0,Josh Stolberg's mild-mannered satire imagines that teenage rebellion in the Bush era has gone soft.
0,"A comedy so inane and tedious that it buries its premise and its various worthy points under too many arch and improbable shenanigans and endless dialogue, much of it seriously under-inspired."
0,"Short on real teenage angst and emotion, the film is long on caricatures."
1,Better than it has any right to be.
0,The movie delivers little more than fast reflex laughs.
0,Would be easier to root for if it weren't so very pleased with itself.
0,"A feeble call to arms, and inept entertainment to boot."
0,"While a title card at the beginning of the picture says the story is inspired by true events, it really should read, 'Inspired by another film.'"
0,"Filmmaker Josh Stolberg claims to have been inspired by real-life events, but mostly he ineptly rips off other movies and wastes a cast that includes Rosanna Arquette, Adam Arkin and Elizabeth Perkins."
0,You get the exhausting feeling that Stolberg is desperately trying to prove how cool he is.
1,"An anti-Bush, pro-First Amendment, completely ridiculous fight-the-power comedy that happens to have been inspired by actual events."
1,You know all those 'brainless high school comedies'? Here's what one would look like if it had brains.
0,"This indie teen movie is like a cafeteria lunch tray: lots of little compartments, with nothing particularly appetizing in any of them."
0,Well-meaning but woefully unconvincing.
0,
0,What a wasted opportunity.
0,Chris Columbus has pasted the grungy La Boheme update onto film with slavish respect for the original material but a shortage of stylistic imagination and raw emotions.
1,"Rent is one of the best film musicals in years -- exuberant, sexy and life affirming in equal measure."
0,No amount of confident theatrical pedigree will carry a movie musical in the wrong directorial hands.
1,Director Chris Columbus has done what any smart filmmaker would do with a musical and let the songs dictate his movie.
0,Most of the musical numbers aren't stylized (a natty tango number is an exception) but based in a Hollywood-gritty reality that at times feels silly.
0,"The scourge of rock-opera, a musical mutation that manages to combine the least savory elements of both with the advantages of neither."
1,"If nothing else, the movie reveals Jonathan Larson's musical to be an illuminating time capsule of a wild period immediately before and after the scourge of AIDS."
1,In terms of its music and lyrics Rent flickers more than it flames.
0,They're saying Rent was of its moment. They're saying that moment has passed. So the point of making the movie is . . . ?
0,Rent takes to the streets of New York and convulses in song and dance for nearly two solid hours.
1,Now a vastly larger audience has the chance to experience the masterwork of a prodigiously talented man who died far too young.
0,The music and direction feel generic but the cast deserves credit for squeezing every possible drop of emotion out of the material.
1,"Time has been kind to the impoverished but sexy middle-class dropouts of Rent, who no longer come off as Broadway-mall versions of the last urban renegades in America."
1,"Rent is still Rent, and devotees should adore it while haters will hate it (there are, apparently, plenty of both)."
0,Too often seems like a late-season American Idol episode that's all Abdul encouragement without any Simon snarkiness.
1,Columbus should be credited for preserving the showstopping vigor of a stage production that was stronger on oomph than on depth.
0,Rent falls betwixt and between the odd intimacy of theater and the glorious bigness of film -- and vice versa.
1,"I've never seen the stage musical Rent, but the movie had me at hello."
0,"Yes, Rent is about penniless artists who can't afford to eat or pay their electric bills. But must their straits extend to the threadbare filmmaking, too?"
1,"If Rent works -- and most of the time, it does so flawlessly -- it is because it remains Rent."
0,"Rent is commodified faux bohemia on a platter, eliciting the same kind of numbing soul-sadness as children's beauty pageants, tiny dogs in expensive boots, Mahatma Gandhi in Apple ads."
1,"Those who have an enduring affection for Rent should enjoy the film, at least on a nostalgia level."
0,Rent showcases the hipster trend of getting nostalgic about grime and crime: it's slumtimental.
0,"Stage original Taye Diggs, playing an erstwhile friend turned evictor, actually made a stronger screen impression in Malibu's Most Wanted."
0,Rent is about as timely now as Gigi.
0,"Onstage, Rent is a series of power surges, but in the movie the songs leave you flat."
0,"There's still something staid and doggedly stagebound about this Rent, a reluctance to set out for someplace unique and engage the audience on purely cinematic terms."
1,Chris Columbus's film affirms that Rent belongs in the pantheon of immortal musicals celebrating the self-dramatizing and resilient spirit of youth.
0,"Those who haven't seen Rent on the stage will sense they're missing something, and they are."
1,"The movie makes the story accessible to everyone, without diminishing the musical's revolutionary, youthful heart."
0,RENT is mediocre and recommended only to those who can claim a familiarity with the play.
0,"A mediocre, unimaginative, inefficient filmmaker, Columbus delivers a Rent that isn't so much bad as perfunctory."
1,"As directed by Columbus, Jonathan Larson's East Village reworking of 'La Boheme' in the age of AIDS retains its calisthenic pathos, as well as most of its original cast, but you'd have to be a real Rent-Head to envisage Academy Awards in its future."
1,"The film captures the beautiful spirit and the raw energy of Larson's play, and it respects the wonderful, gorgeous, life-affirming music."
0,"It's real -- and, on screen, it's really cringe-worthy. Not quite Phantom of the Opera cringe-worthy, but not as much fun to blow raspberries at, either."
0,"The movie, directed without a personal stamp of any kind by Chris Columbus, is so slick that the grime comes from a spray can and the grungy bohemian costumes look rented from a Betsey Johnson boutique sale."
0,"High hopes, flat results."
1,"In all respects, Jarhead is straight from the horse's mouth. See it."
0,"The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid the politics surrounding the first Gulf War even as they pay tribute to the Marines, the jarheads, who went to Saudi Arabia to fight. But the result is a movie rife with ambivalence."
0,"Sam Mendes' third feature has numerous arresting moments but never achieves a confident, consistent or sufficiently audacious tone."
0,The movie is oppressively heavy even when mischievously lighthearted.
1,Jarhead is compelling in the way it presents a new facet of a genre that some would argue was mined out long ago.
0,Jarhead has an oddly amorphous and inconclusive feeling to it.
1,"Watching Jarhead, these unvarnished snapshots of what can really happen among U.S. combat troops all but slap you with their observational force."
0,"Jarhead feels detached, and the internal turmoil of its protagonist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) lacks urgency -- even with first-person narration to fill in some of the gaps."
1,It's a good thing Jarhead features strong acting; otherwise the uneven ratio of exposition to action would become unbearable.
1,[A] sweltering and pristine portrait of one Marine's experience of the first Persian Gulf war.
1,Jarhead will leave many viewers satisfied and others scratching their heads. But everybody will be asking questions.
0,"Jarhead is a movie that walks up to some of the most urgent and painful issues of our present circumstance, clears its throat loudly and says nothing."
0,"As much as we intellectually admire Jarhead, it's a cold film that only sporadically makes the kind of emotional connection it's after."
1,"Jarhead is a minimalist epic -- a grunt's eye view of the 1991 Persian Gulf War that, in more ways than one, never lifts its gaze higher."
1,"It is not often that a movie catches exactly what it was like to be this person in this place at this time, but Jarhead does."
1,"A good, not great movie."
0,"Only a first-rate cast -- headed by Jake Gyllenhaal, and made memorable by the performances of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard -- saves Jarhead from looking like a dead duck, covered in oil."
1,"While Jarhead, based on Anthony Swofford's best seller about his modern-day experiences in the Marines, has its moments, it never quite attains its loftiest goals."
1,"What's so good about the movie is Gyllenhaal's refusal to show off; he doesn't seem jealous of the camera's attention when it goes to others and is content, for long stretches, to serve simply as a prism though which other young men can be observed."
1,"Director Sam Mendes' third screen outing pretty well nails Swofford's tone, which was mordant without being disrespectful, and, in fact, is begrudgingly reverent of the Corps."
1,"Jarhead makes its points less obviously than most war films, and with more brains than blood."
1,"The best war movies -- and this one, despite its being overlong and repetitive, is among them -- hold that men fight (or in this case, are ready to fight) not for causes, but to survive and to help their comrades do the same."
1,"Jarhead is often a film about boredom, but it's never boring; full of unexpected touches and detailed character turns."
1,The invigorating thing about Jarhead is it makes us encounter the truth in its undigested form.
0,"As hard as the actors work, Jarhead feels false right down to its seductive visuals."
1,Gyllenhaal is the heart and soul of a darkly funny and ferociously intense movie that sets its sights on soldiers under the gun of doing nothing.
1,"Although the picture suffers a narrative letdown in the third act that leaves its central characters -- and, alas, its audience -- in the muck of anticlimax, Jarhead has moments of real glory."
0,Jarhead can't shoot its way out of its own cliches.
1,"The movie is so good you wish it were even better, particularly in its characterizations."
0,Do I quibble over details? Details are all the movie offers.
0,"The movie has some of the washed-out look of David O. Russell's excellent Three Kings, but none of the edge."
0,"The people you feel most badly for in Jarhead are not the men played by these talented actors, but the marketing department at Universal Pictures, saddled with the impossible task of selling a war movie that doesn't contain any actual war in it."
1,"I dare anyone to watch this bold exercise in postponed gratification and not come away with a new, disturbed sense of the genre."
0,"A war picture that, trying to pass off fidelity to the book as objectivity, sacrifices any voice of its own, and ends up not knowing what to think."
0,"Nicely acted, beautifully shot and pretty much devoid of action and context, Jarhead has to be considered one of the year's biggest failures, simply because so much talent went into a film so empty."
0,"In the end, Jarhead is more of a training exercise than a meaningful mission, one that hits some targets without drawing any blood."
0,"It's not easy to make an interesting movie about men who are bored, and Jarhead can't quite rise to the challenge."
1,"Jarhead does an impressive job of articulating the weird, often volatile convergence of the antisocial with the utterly loyal that seems to be the M.O. of a lot of men not yet grown."
0,"As a study of one man's war experience, Jarhead has its moments. But if you want a great movie about the Gulf War, rent David O. Russell's Three Kings."
0,"The film evokes Three Kings, Full Metal Jacket, Catch-22, and other touchstones of the genre without ever establishing its own identity."
1,This is a very strong film with really good performances.
0,"Screenwriter William Broyles, Jr., a former Vietnam pilot and Newsweek editor, connects reasonably well with the material, but American Beauty director Sam Mendes has a tendency to smooth out the rough edges, and the film goes flat as month-old soda."
1,"Jarhead is utterly predictable (boys endure tough training; boys encounter another culture and are baffled), studded with first-rate performances."
1,"Stunning to look at and to listen to, with elegantly chosen pop songs unspooling on the soundtrack under each fresh new horror."
1,Jarhead takes a perverse pleasure in confounding your expectations of what a war movie should be.
1,"The film's strong suit is vagueness, presenting combat as a semi-surreal state of ignorant expectation and dislocated experience: these warriors loll in the desert awaiting action or trying to make sense of its consequences."
0,"It's another fine Gyllenhaal performance, but not really enough, because his suffering doesn't amount to a hill of Kuwaiti sand in the end."
0,"Gyllenhaal can, in fact, act, so the blame must fall elsewhere for his dim performance, all topless tears and soulful voiceovers. The same goes for Peter Sarsgaard, Chris Cooper and Jamie Foxx, three good actors forced into contortions of theatrics."
0,"This 28th entry in Toho Studio's series about the fire-breathing big fella is campily engaging for a while, but at two hours-+ you may come out feeling captivated dead."
1,An evocative yet slow-moving exploration of the Pocahontas myth.
1,"This is no breathless film fantasy; its pulse is stately, contemplative. But anyone who has keen eyes and an open heart will surely go soaring and crashing with the lovers lost in Malick's exotic, erotic new world."
0,"Malick's exalted visuals and isolated metaphysical epiphanies are ill-supported by a muddled, lurching narrative, resulting in a sprawling, unfocused account of an epochal historical moment."
1,Rapturously romantic and haunting.
1,One of the best movies of the year.
0,"As an epic, it's monumentally slight."
1,"The lesson is as clear as rainwater: to the innocent eye, ripe for marvelling, every world is new."
1,"It's a worthy effort, and recommended viewing for those who have interest."
0,The movie is two and a half hours of paralyzing tedium.
0,"Terrence Malick may not care much for people, but he never met a tree he didn't like."
0,That sound you're about to hear is the cracking of spines as Terrence Malick enthusiasts like me bend over backward trying to cut The New World a break.
1,"The New World is a work of breathtaking imagination, less a movie than a mode of transport, and in every sense a masterpiece."
1,"In Terrence Malick's elegiac film, Pocahontas is a woman whose story has the reach of myth and the tragic dimension of life."
1,"The New World blows centuries of dust and schoolkid romanticism from the oft-mythologized tale of Pocahontas and the English settlers, relaying old news with an abundantly poetic and visually startling point of view."
0,"This lavish coffee-table-book of a movie gradually reveals itself as an uninvolving, crashing bore."
1,Malick is a writer-director of extraordinary vision who is like an endangered species.
0,"The movie is verdantly lush, and full of the most marvelous landscapes and images. But there's something missing here. And it's the people."
1,"Many have tried, but none can match Malick's touch for shuffling a deck of elegiac images."
0,The ponderous narrative lacks so much focus that it will likely leave most viewers squirming in their seats.
0,"Malick appears to consider this an epic tale, but beyond its 2-hour-+ length, the film never quite reaches the scale he's after."
0,"The movie's gorgeous pictorialism draws us toward the shore, but Malick often leaves us marooned in the shoals, waiting for a story to arrive."
0,There's a problem when the movie about the European conquest of America seems longer than the actual conquest itself.
0,"It's by no means the longest movie ever made, but it's one of the longest movies ever made in which next to nothing ever happens and barely a word is spoken."
1,"He [ Terrence Malick] is a visionary, and this story requires one."
1,"The film, which is superb on every technical and design level, has both greatness and fuzzy-headedness in it."
1,The New World is more an ethereal cinematic tone poem than plot-driven story.
1,"The New World isn't Terrence Malick's best, but it's guiding him in the right direction."
1,"The New World laps over its audience like water on a deserted beach, moving so quietly that you almost don't notice that it's enveloped you."
0,"The New World is stately almost to the point of being static and thus has trouble finding a central story around which to arrange itself; it's not quite the thin dead line, but it's close."
0,"He [Malick] swoons for his own well-honed image as a painter of woodland idylls, a man who leaves no sway of wheat or ripple of water unmet by his fatherly gaze."
1,"Through elliptical and seemingly oblique methods, he [Malick] forges moments of staggering emotional power."
1,"Like the best music, this film elicits emotions rather than manipulates them."
1,"Malick paints the celluloid like a canvas, filling it with rapturous images of wild America, its flowing fields of grass, rivers teeming with fish and the endless horizon of free land."
0,"A Terence Malick film remains an event, but he appears awfully disoriented in The New World -- less a seasoned traveller than a perplexed tourist, content to mask his confusion by reaching for a camera and snapping relentless pretty pictures."
0,"For all its splendor, The New World is really a love affair between Malick and his camera."
0,Malick is so content to tell the tale through mood that he neglects its meaning.
1,"A movie that is at once prosaic and abstract, breathtakingly beautiful and excruciatingly obvious, compelling contemplative and deadly dull."
0,"New World has some fine imagery, but it doesn't transport us in the way The Thin Red Line did."
1,The New World is a poetic force at once wrenching and soothing.
0,Watching The New World is like watching a snail cross an eight-lane highway.
1,"Malick has a gorgeous talent for capturing supernal landscapes, for conveying their sorrow, and it would be a loss if he stopped directing again at a time when Hollywood is more starved than ever before for the personal touch."
1,"Self-indulgent, gorgeous, maddening, grueling, ultimately transcendent, it's a Terrence Malick movie all the way, and possibly the director's most sustained work since 1972's Badlands."
1,"A profound, revealing, wonderful film about the meeting of two cultures and the shaping of a new one."
1,The New World is a film to which you have to surrender to enjoy.
1,"These whispered ruminations are beautifully written, but whose voice are we hearing?"
1,"All [Malick's] trademarks are present and correct: the swaying grass, the gurgling rivers, the trees, the birds, the internal monologues. They all fit."
0,"With the BBC's 1995 miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle still regarded as the definitive treatment of the book, it will be an uphill struggle to win audiences to what is neither a faithful rendition nor a very interesting new interpretation."
1,"Anyone coming to the movie fresh and not demanding a chapter-by-chapter adaptation will respond to the pic's emotional sweep, sumptuous lensing and marvelous sense of ensemble."
1,Makes an agreeably refined accompaniment to a bucket of popcorn.
1,"Even the most rabid Janeites must allow that director Joe Wright, 33, has given Austen's novel a beguilingly youthful spin without compromising the novel's late-eighteenth-century manners."
0,"Any resemblance to scenes and characters created by Miss Austen is, of course, entirely coincidental."
1,Director Joe Wright also coordinates a delightfully cohesive acting ensemble.
1,"At a time when we seem to be inundated by one gruesome, depressing movie after another, it's reassuring to see an elegant man's pride and a stubborn woman's prejudice reach the lushly realized assertion that love conquers all."
1,A movie in which the search for love all but pulses with the excitement of uncertainty.
1,"A stellar adaptation, bewitching the viewer completely and incandescently with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit."
1,Wright and Moggach open the windows on P&P and let it breathe.
1,"A joy from start to finish. If this one doesn't inspire a rush on bookstores, nothing will."
1,One of the most delightful and heartwarming adaptations made from Austen or anybody else.
1,"If the filmmaking is somewhat less perfect than in Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, Austen fans will nonetheless delight to see their favorite characters brought to life."
1,A sumptuous screen adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that gathers you up on its white horse and gallops off into the sunset.
1,"As with so much of this Pride & Prejudice, you wish it would never end."
1,"Pride & Prejudice is highbrow movie- making, in the finest sense of the term."
1,"It's an exuberant film adaptation of real personality -- lively, coltish, imaginatively conceived for a fluid camera."
1,"Of Austen's novels, none is more beloved than this one, so it's good to see it once again brought to the screen with the pride which it deserves."
1,If young audiences respond to it at all -- as I am sure they will -- it will be because Wright has brought out the vigor in Austen's romance in a way that the other adaptations I've seen never quite accomplished.
1,"Knightley brings Austen's book to glorious, pulsating life."
1,"Director Joe Wright, working from a screenplay by Deborah Moggach, has brought both romantic sweep and rich verisimilitude to Austen's story."
1,"As historically authentic-looking as Pride & Prejudice is, it has far more invested in emotional authenticity -- you feel engaged every moment."
1,"Wright's Pride is a boisterous, loud, dance-mad kind of place, full of ruddy-faced peasants, dirt and hay. The whole thing feels like it was art-directed by Bruegel on holiday."
1,"Like the classic novel itself, the movie brings a certain sadness when the end has come and there is no more to watch."
1,A joy to behold.
1,"Pride & Prejudice satisfies as dreamy romance. It's not the razor-sharp satire that Austen can be, but it's lovely entertainment."
1,"For the uninitiated, I can't imagine a better introduction to this classic."
1,"This is a playful Pride, cuddly and cute and all lush English pastures, stunning sunsets and regal manor homes."
1,"The film is faithful to its source material, but not in a rigid, stodgy way. It's the rare adaptation that should please purists and dilettantes alike."
1,"Listen up, guys, have I got a flick for you: It's all about money, sex and slammin' babes in saucy-wench get-ups, and it goes down in the same country that gave us Led Zeppelin and the Clash."
1,"This Pride & Prejudice isn't minutely faithful to the book -- and for good reason -- but it is authentic where it counts: to the confused, wounded, eager hearts of its lovers."
1,Seeing the splendid new version of Pride & Prejudice can be hazardous to your health: There's a very real danger of swooning.
1,"Knightley is the best thing about this enjoyable adaptation, immediately owning the wardrobe and the words and the weather as if she were born to the manner -- and manor."
1,"It's all compelling, real and fresh."
0,"It's really in the second hour that P&P heads off in an unpersuasive melodramatic direction, signalled by a sudden overdose of piano arpeggios."
1,"Joe Wright, in his feature-length directorial debut, accommodates the genteel gauze without neglecting the well-aimed stings."
1,The spirit of this version feels fresher and more youthful than previous editions.
0,I just feel like I've seen this so many times.
1,"Dare I say that even Jane Austen herself would have delighted in the final triumph of Ms. Knightley's quick-witted Elizabeth in this film? Yes, I do, and all the highbrow and middlebrow cinephobes of the world be damned."
1,"Wright wastes no time in squeezing the plot into his just-over-two hours running time, but the film never feels rushed, particularly when so much of it is spent watching and waiting, as the characters come to understand the world they live in."
1,"Keira's cat-smile suggests such supernal all-knowingness that, with Austen's adapted dialogue (via Deborah Moggach) tripping off her tongue, she comes off as an eighteenth-century Maureen Dowd."
0,"It's a fitfully engaging romance, it's just not Pride and Prejudice."
0,The bark of The Ringer is far more outrageous than its bite.
0,This wannabe daring comedy about a man who attempts to 'fix' the Special Olympics strains for that patented naughty and nice balance with squirmingly squishy results.
0,"No matter how daring today's comedies think they are, someone has been there before and done it funnier."
1,A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers.
1,"The Ringer could have been a better movie, but that would have depended more on the screenplay than the cast, which is effective and generates real affection."
1,"Though The Ringer is hardly the Farrellys' best, you'll probably be smiling, too."
0,The Ringer is caught between a rock and a soft place. The result of being torn between here and there is being stuck nowhere.
1,"The Ringer is a much sweeter comedy than its pedigree suggests. In fact, it's almost the opposite of what we expect."
1,"There's something about a movie deft enough to have fun with mental disability, yet still get a stamp of approval from the Special Olympics."
0,"In all its lobbying for our laughter, The Ringer feels too lawyered-up and politically positioned to trigger much laughter at all."
0,"The worthwhile bits are few and far between. In the rush to avoid exploiting the athletes, the filmmakers have stuck it to the audience instead. Not funny."
1,"Predictable and unconvincing as romantic comedy, the movie is surprisingly sweet and funny whenever Steve is hanging out with his fellow Special Olympics players."
1,"As in the best Special Olympics events, everyone finds a way to win."
0,"The movie is ultimately unclassifiable. It can't be dismissed as a cheap gimmick, nor can it be embraced as an earnest tribute."
0,"You could make a very funny comedy about a guy who pretends to be retarded so he can win the Special Olympics, but The Ringer isn't it."
1,"Though the movie bears some of the Farrellys' trademark outrageous humor, it has a sweet demeanor and makes a noble statement."
0,The movie dilutes its own outrageous setup with sitcom contrivance by introducing a ridiculous love-story subplot.
1,"No one will accuse The Ringer of being tasteful, but when you're not laughing, you may find yourself genuinely touched."
1,"If The Ringer doesn't strike comedy gold, it at least manages to score enough points to bring home the bronze."
0,The Ringer misses endless opportunities to have real fun or make points with the situation.
1,"Knoxville's willingness to go to any length to humiliate himself for a laugh actually serves his guilt-ridden character, but the movie's real stars are the Special Olympians, who aren't trying to be inspirational or even likable, just funny."
0,A paint-by-numbers romantic comedy most notable for its determined inoffensiveness.
0,"In striving to be fair beyond reproach, this movie misses many chances to be funnier. Good comedy doesn't make that choice, and great comedy doesn't have to."
0,"An uncomfortable intermingling of message movie and gross-out comedy, a sporadically funny vehicle that indicts its audience for laughing. Come on, guys. You can't have your fun and eat it too."
0,It's just so predictable.
1,"The Ringer, for all its glaring flaws, pulls the rug out from under us."
0,

1,The sense of wonderment and desire for understanding that envelop the old soldier and the young disciple create a mood of profound optimism.
0,"With the film's coda set at ground zero, Wenders has never seemed more of a tourist."
1,"Land of Plenty has a few too many coincidences and tends to be sugary, but it has an important precautionary message in this age of terror."
0,"Taking up the divided, anxious state of post-9/11 American life, Wim Wenders's new film is like a clumsy, well-meaning intervention in a family quarrel."
0,"Wenders handles America's physical landscape with characteristic clarity. But he never gets a handle on the trickier political terrain and so, like Uncle Paul, ends up chasing too many roads to nowhere."
1,"Hampered by an ending that overreaches needlessly, the film is nevertheless worthy and unmistakably the effort of an enduringly distinctive and important filmmaker."
1,"Wim Wenders' first fiction featurefeature since 2000's The Million Dollar Hotel, rocky but respectable Land of Plenty proves the helmer often does better with low budgets, fast schedules and young collaborators."
1,It casts a spell of compassionate humanity with a gently healing effect.
0,"While the sunny production values and '70s bubblegum soundtrack carry the film up to a point, there's a more-of-the-same quality to the narrative that simply can't sustain its 36-chapter, 135-minute running time."
0,"If an eventful life journey doesn't produce maturity or just simple insight, it doesn't feel terribly worth it."
1,Murphy is an actor to watch. Even in heels.
1,Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale stars Cillian Murphy as an Irish transvestite who is arrested after the bombing of a London disco.
0,"So dense with dying fizzle and limp ideas that I began to wonder if Jordan has an evil twin, or if there are in fact several Neil Jordans, among them at least one literate stylist and one humor-handicapped village idiot."
0,"Beneath the film's monotony, one senses a whiff of cop-out, of playing it safe: Patrick, for all his tender yearnings, shows no lust, no messy ego. He's a saddened saint in pouffy shirts, and Jordan turns his crying game into one big, long whine."
0,The movie's drastic shifts in tone sabotage any attempt at sustained emotional engagement.
0,"Breakfast on Pluto dishes out some inspired ideas and brazen performances but as a whole, it's an unwieldy meal."
1,"Murphy's tour de force as the eternally optimistic Patrick surely deserves an Oscar nomination. Thanks to Jordan's bravura storytelling, Breakfast on Pluto is one of very few movies this year truly worth remembering."
0,The twittering main character quickly wears out his welcome.
1,"In [Jordan's] new film, Breakfast on Pluto, he's trying for a much more elaborate version of [The Crying Game]."
0,"Pluto's story is scattershot, though it occasionally resonates."
0,"The very characteristics that keep him alive and kicking are the ones that keep you at arm's length. No surprise, then, that even the satisfying and semi-satisfying conclusions to various narrative threads don't quite satisfy."
1,"You'll be singing along to the soundtrack of Neil Jordan's enchanting Breakfast on Pluto, which boasts the most felicitous use of wall-to-wall pop songs I've ever heard."
1,Enchanting and hopeful.
0,"Ultimately, the film's detachment is its inspired idea and its inherent problem."
0,"We're handed 36 separate chapters in the life of an androgynous sunbeam, but the whimsy is like a piece of caramel lodged between two of your back teeth: a sweet irritant."
0,"Breakfast on Pluto ambles along nicely, but feels as if it's never going to end."
1,A cunningly crafted fairytale ...
1,"It's a film in and of its own world, sparked by a wicked performance full of wide-eyed wonder."
1,"Held together by a brilliant fiber of obscure pop songs from the era, Breakfast on Pluto may be Jordan's most agreeable mixture of wisdom and whimsy."
1,... ambitious and endlessly intriguing ...
0,"... despite the movie's bouncy ebullience (courtesy of a terrific period soundtrack) and dashes of fantasy, the film quickly becomes an endurance test."
0,"If you're in the mood for an edgy, raucous, music-driven gender-bender, rent Hedwig and the Angry Inch instead."
1,"Jordan is the kind of director you follow out of trust, even when his movies aren't perfect."
1,[T]he performance by Cillian Murphy ... is terrific.
0,"Like Cillian Murphy in high heels, Breakfast On Pluto totters along with unnerving hesitancy."
1,"Perhaps too audacious for some and too coy for others, Breakfast on Pluto is one of those mercurial movies where you really have no idea where it'll take you next. Like its star, it's smart, mischievous and fearless."
1,"[Jordan] successfully grafts two Irish literary modes, snappy social satire and gloomy dirge."
0,The film is downright aggravating.
1,"Breakfast on Pluto may seem a fairy tale at times (no pun intended), but this Kitten has claws."
0,"Like Kitten and everything else about Breakfast on Pluto, it's altogether too overstated and obvious, but at least it doesn't pretend to have any significance whatsoever."
0,"Sadly, Kitten himself is the sort you'd be happy to string across a tennis racket, and the film never quite copes with his lethal insufferability."
1,You'll enjoy the scenery and maybe learn a little something.
1,"A startling record of the adventurers' progress, setbacks and encounters with natives and antiquities as they make their way to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea."
1,A lovely but sedate version of Scaturro and Brown's history-making adventure.
0,"By patching together snippets from all these stories, then stitching them together with a cliched, lazily rendered script, this film does nothing but make us wonder what we've missed."
1,"Provides a banquet of stunning scenery while making the most of the sweeping, panoramic capabilities of the Imax format."
1,"The filmmakers document some of the more-difficult challenges the expedition faced, but they also provide an informative overview of the river's biology and history, as well as introducing some of the people who depend on the river."
0,"Steeped in important discoveries, yet I never get a clear idea of what these people are up to."
0,
1,"Football Factory isn't self-consciously cool; it has a base, wild energy that will stay with you."
1,"An unsparing depiction of the ugly violence surrounding the beautiful game, The Football Factory uses jagged camera work and a pumpedup soundtrack to create a strangely seductive choreography of fists, boots and bricks on flesh."
1,"This thoughtful adaptation gets it mostly right, from those warm visuals to the amiable cast."
0,"Rudimentary on every level, this long-gestating Universal pic based on the children's character is pitched toward the youngest of kids -- roughly ages zygote to 4 -- with direct-to-video quality animation, plotting and backgrounds."
1,Misanthropic toddlers will be rolling in the aisles.
1,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new cartoon of Curious George, featuring the voice of Will Ferrell as the Man in the Yellow Hat, doesn't veer all that far from the soothing tone of the books."
0,It's pretty elementary.
1,"As simple, friendly, kid-appropriate and nontoxic as any major motion picmerchtainment franchise could ever hope to be."
1,"If you count yourself among the curious, spend an afternoon with George."
0,"If these virtues sound passive, it's because the movie is passive, not to mention overplotted and misfocused."
1,"The movie, particularly the endearing George, should appeal to young children, and the humor should elicit a few chuckles among their parents as well."
1,"Adults and kids older than 12 may find the story a few bananas short of a bunch, but expect the younger set to find it curiously satisfying."
1,"With top-drawer voice talent and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation that echoes the simple colors and shapes of the books, Curious George is an unexpected delight."
1,"The movie is faithful to the spirit and innocence of the books, and director Matthew O'Callaghan and his team create a visual look that is uncluttered, charming, and not so realistic that it undermines the fantasies on the screen."
1,"Because almost all animated films now are computer generated, the 2-D animated Curious George has the not-unpleasant patina of an antique."
0,"Kaufman tosses in thudding references to cell phones and lattes, falling into modernization traps that the makers of the very respectable Winnie the Pooh films managed to avoid."
0,"Molasses-sweet, plot-heavy and pandering."
1,"Despite eerie narrative parallels with King Kong, the most curious thing about Curious George is how gentle it is."
1,"Although the makers of Curious George decided a 21st century update was necessary, they fill the movie with enough tributes to the Reys to take a lot of the sting away."
1,"When children are so into a movie that they don't make a peep or kick the back of your theater seat, it is a success."
1,"This is an adaptation that is absolutely faithful to the child's-eye-view books, down to the name of the ship that brings George from Africa -- the H.A. Rey."
0,"Despite 16 years in development and drafts by many prominent Hollywood screenwriters, the finished product (credited to O'Callaghan and Mike Webb) feels undeveloped, like a 10-minute TV cartoon stretched to barely feature length."
0,"Skip the movie altogether, and buy one of the books, instead."
1,"Visually, the movie benefits from a charming animation style, a traditional 2-D approach layered with shadows and backlit halos. But it benefits most from George, still worming his way into people's hearts."
1,The biggest surprise of Curious George is how it keeps consistently entertaining at a kids' level.
1,"Artful simplicity may be an impossible quality in a modern children's movie, so Curious George opts instead for mayhem under a blanket of sweetness. The little ones understand."
1,The energy level never flags long enough for the little ones to be bored.
0,"The artwork, I liked it, is faithful to the original, but to tell people my age, or someone 25, that they should see nine or ten bucks to see this movie I can't do it."
1,Curious George is probably the purest family movie in years.
0,"The whole thing might be a bit more bearable were it not for the tooth-rotting sweetness of Jack Johnson's songs, which are all about learning by doing, and how important it is to have friends, and other such guff."
1,It's good old-fashioned family entertainment.
0,"It's harmless, colourful fun, but even the very young are used to better."
1,"George is just so darn cute with his big eyes and bright smile and perpetually sunny disposition, he's pretty much impossible to resist."
1,"It's a gentle, unhurried, largely hand-drawn children's cartoon with a nice simple storyline and no nods and winks to the grown-ups."
1,The welcome absence of strained cleverness qualifies as one of its biggest virtues.
0,Gentle enough to satisfy the wee ones but has little to offer their adult companions...
1,"Director Matthew O'Callaghan and screenwriter Ken Kaufman haven't tried to create a film that's hip, just one that's funny and sweet, and in that sense they've succeeded."
0,... unnecessary but genial ...
0,"While there are moments of raucous humor, there's too much sentimental fluff."
0,... inconsequential sequel for the undemanding moviegoer.
0,"... the family film vibe doesn't suit a manic-tempered comic such as Lawrence, whose fat suit and septuagenarian makeup can't hide his obvious boredom in delivering more of the same wheezing insults and down-home advice."
0,"Aside from the inane plot, Big Momma's House 2 is a dish of empty calories."
1,"BMH2 is a harmless, genial outing, a comedy that is amusing without ever rising to the level of funny."
0,Painfully unfunny slapstick takes precedence over would-be satire.
0,"There's nobody in the movie to care one whit about except Lawrence. Nobody else is interesting, funny or worth noting."
0,"Big Momma may be larger than life, but the shtick is older than old."
0,"Probably review-proof for openers, pic is so episodic and flat it should be a letdown even to those amused by the original."
0,"A partial list of things that are more amusing than Big Momma's House 2: Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch, the original Big Momma's House, every sitcom currently on TV, open-heart surgery."
0,"Usually, you can tell when an actor is enjoying himself in a role, but I honestly couldn't tell whether Lawrence was having fun or simply exploiting the character for a second dip at the box office. I just hope he has no reason to do it again."
0,Big Momma's House 2 is an atrocious film. But what's even more frightening is that Hollywood thinks people will find it funny.
0,"Even if you still find the premise funny, how long can you laugh at this same sorry routine?"
1,As warmhearted as the original.
0,"Martin Lawrence is a broad comic performer who sometimes hits the funny bone with a mallet -- and sometimes, well, goes wide of the mark by several yards."
0,It's really just a ploy for some more flaccid fat-suit antics that are as short of inspiration as Big Momma is of breath.
0,The least necessary sequel this side of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo.
0,"If Lawrence makes you laugh, you'd be better off watching him do stand-up."
1,"It's mildly, amiably funny, in a juvenile way."
0,"This is funny mostly for its brazen disregard of common sense -- specifically, the idea that elaborate full-body prosthetic makeup could be slapped on in seconds by a cop on the run."
0,
0,
0,Poor CG effects reduce Chen Kaige's martial fantasy to cartoonishness.
0,"Even in fantasy, an internal logic must apply."
1,It's a knockout that works on many levels.
0,"You can't help wondering how the same Fifth Gen filmmaker who made Yellow Earth and Life on a String could've fallen on such hard times, or justified such goofiness to himself."
1,"A heady blend of swordplay, somersaults, fairy-tale romance, and computer-generated whoosh."
0,I can't imagine Road Runner was what Chen had in mind for the most expensive movie ever made in China...
1,"Fans of newer Asian martial-arts movies will be satisfied with The Promise, especially because it contains the aerial wirework and swordplay expected of such movies. But the film is not as accomplished as the work of Ang Lee or Yimou Zhang."
1,"A lavish spectacle somewhere between grand opera and cartoon about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess."
0,"A princess with a curse, a case of mistaken identity and some of the worst special effects in a film by a world-class director."
0,"The over-the-top acting is forgivable, but the plot's incoherence is not."
1,"The Promise naturally expresses its mythic qualities through stunning visuals, breathtaking costuming, and a great deal of action, and it adds in Kaige's Ridley Scott-like fondness for vistas full of floating, drifting objects, from feathers to flo"
1,"Chen Kaige clearly intended this Chinese fantasy-action spectacle to top Zhang Yimou's Hero, and I must admit that I prefer it to the earlier movie."
0,The Promise is too full of frenetic disconnection and arbitrary comings and goings to connect meaningfully with the hearts and minds of its audience.
1,With The Promise Chen Kaige has proven enough of a professional that he can make the product. But he remains too much of an artist not to scribble on his signature.
0,Chen's strength seems to be more with character-driven stories; here's hoping that his next film returns to more comfortable ground.
0,"Laden with a plot that could generously be called silly or, less forgivingly, stupid, it never achieves lift-off despite numerous scenes of warriors doing battle in midair."
1,"Simply in terms of its visual poetry, the exhilarating effects of image upon image of dazzling impossibility, The Promise is not to be missed."
1,"[The film elicits] the wide-eyed joy of seeing hundreds of soldiers ride through sets of colossal extravagance. And the sweet release of, briefly, suspending all holds on reality or even logic -- and surrendering to the joys of a fairy tale."
0,The Promise employs laughable computer effects and second-rate martial-arts fighting to tell the hard-to-figure story of a princess and her three lovers.
0,"As is evident by the film's strong start and faltering finale, the trouble with any promise is failing to keep it."
1,"In the midst of such unrelenting splendour, it's easy to nod gratefully -- and then to nod off."
0,"Much of The Promise resembles a Cirque du Soleil extravaganza, which makes it tough to take seriously."
1,The Promise is one of those movies in which the individual sequences seem to surpass the overall achievement.
0,"Oddly, The Promise -- which takes place hundreds, even thousands, of years ago, when art directors ruled the earth -- is flagrantly otherworldly but in a way that somehow weighs the picture down."
0,It suggests that talented Chinese directors are being led astray by the seductions of CGI and wirework fantasies.
0,A mess of a movie.
1,"Has been criticized by some reviewers for its low-tech special effects. Curiously, I found this technical transparency part of the film's enormous charm."
0,[I]n no time flat you get a clear idea of how broadly painted and platitudinous Randolph Kret's Pariah is [...] If only being right were all you needed.
1,"Pariah, a raw and unblinking look at the skinhead subculture, is a movie I'd like to show to those admirers of Fight Club who have assured me of their movie's greatness. This is the real thing..."
1,There's no doubting the ability of [director Randolph] Kret [...] in working up an audience and drawing persuasive performances from a sizable cast.
0,[T]his [...] film by Randolph Kret mistakes the study of a particularly virulent set of symptoms for a diagnosis... Nuance is not something Mr. Kret has much use for.
1,"The film maintains a convincing realism: It's acted out by little-known but expert talents and shot, cleverly, as though the camera were a fly on the wall."
1,"Sincere, sometimes brief performances - including those of John Leguizamo as a disabled veteran, and Julia Stiles as the bitter wife of Nelson's nemesis - lend necessary oomph to a narrative that can, at times, verge on sleepy."
1,Transcends any lingering trace of gimmickry with emotionally gripping results.
1,"Despite multiple onscreen timestamps, the film doesn't generate ticking-clock tension so much as it paints a picture of dead ends and foreordained poverty."
0,"A fast-paced, fitfully clever 3-D-animated feature that will entertain tykes but provide scant novelty for auds who've had their fill of revisionist fairy tale gags and postmodern 'tude from the Shrek franchise."
0,[The film] gets hopelessly lost in the woods.
1,"Hoodwinked is an irreverent, hard-edged retelling of Little Red Riding Hood -- a high-energy, imaginative entertainment aimed at younger audiences."
0,It's got a couple of clever ideas. I thought the animation was uninspired and it's kind of forgettable.
0,"Finally, a Rashomon for the whole family. This cartoon version of 'Little Red Riding Hood' tells and retells its story from a variety of perspectives, all of them boring."
1,"Hoodwinked's most radical feature is that it's a ride without heroes -- unless, that is, you count the filmmakers, who could end up doing for independent animation what Soderbergh and Tarantino did for indie film."
0,"Little Red Riding Hood gets deconstructed in this sub-Shrek bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism."
0,Why would a distributor suddenly yank an animated family film from its intended wide December opening until mid-January? Could it be that the advance word of mouth wasn't very good-winked?
0,"This animated tale about 'what really happened' among the Wolf, Grandma, Red and the Woodsman doesn't excel in any department, from unspectacular computer animation to routine voice talent."
0,"As marketing theory, Hoodwinked makes a little sense. Too bad, then, it's so crummy."
1,"It doesn't rival the artistry of Pixar or DreamWorks, but it's got an upstart charm, a clever premise, appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make you laugh out loud more than once."
1,"Hoodwinked -- which is the latest cartoon recycling of that oft-told fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood -- may be a bit scrappy-looking, but it's also pretty funny at times."
1,"Lacking a budget for big-time effects, the makers of Hoodwinked clearly had more time to work on the jokes."
0,The Shrek-style nudge-nudge jokes aimed at adults are tiresome.
0,"A warped, but mildly amusing twist on the childhood favourite."
0,"The digital animation ranges from competent to clunky, the jokes too often feel tossed-off and random, and the movie too often descends into dullness, only to be yanked back from the abyss by the goat."
0,Offers a few laughs but overall is pretty tired.
1,"Hoodwinked may be a poor cousin to the Shrek franchise, but this made-on-the-cheap computer-animated feature still has more style and snarky gags than Disney's recent CG hit, Chicken Little."
1,"Even though it's basically a 10-minute short puffed up to fill 80 minutes, Hoodwinked has laughs and plenty of them."
0,"Bit by bit, we fall asleep."
1,"While it doesn't exactly break new ground, the movie is fast-paced and delivers lots of laughs aimed at both kids and adults, as well as some lively Looney Tunes-style action."
0,"Features lackluster character design, so-so animation and only fitful bursts of cleverness."
0,"It's bound to disappoint grown-ups who've been spoiled by the Pixar polish, but it's certainly worth a gander down the road on DVD."
0,Feels as warmed over as day-old muffins in Little Red Riding Hood's basket.
0,"Feels uncannily like a too-chipper children's computer game that has somehow become unlinked from its best feature, the interactive menu."
1,The visuals are passable. The story's a lot of fun. And the story is what sells the movie.
0,A computer-animated feature that maintains a moderate level of cleverness without being the least bit engaging.
1,Does exactly what a police procedural should: keeps us guessing.
0,It's a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children.
0,It takes place in a fantasy world whose cheaply rendered surfaces resemble Teletubbieland reupholstered with Naugahyde.
1,Loud and rambunctious and more fun than it has any right to be.
0,"The production contains enough positive elements to make it worth a look, but not until it reaches DVD or TV. As a theatrical offering, it disappoints."
0,"Saddled with cheap-looking animation and a far from stellar cast, this Shrek clone is a diverting but hardly memorable addition to a dangerously overworked genre."
1,"A breezy, passably funny spin on a children's classic, mixing slapstick and farce with character humour and delighting in demolishing stereotypes."
1,"It's more than a little contrived, but Warburton's Wolf has a worldly, hard-bitten charm."
0,Someone give these folks a real budget so they can make a movie that looks as good as it sounds.
1,"This Jerry Bruckheimer production, directed by commercial director James Gartner in a solid feature debut, should please male fans as well as those who don't mind a dose of social commentary with their sports heroics."
1,A slick enterprise buoyed by a Motown-flavored '60s soundtrack and an appealing ensemble cast.
1,Glory Road's strength is the way in which it blends social awareness into the sports genre.
0,A slick package with the wrinkles of real life smoothed clean out of it.
0,"Remember the Titans? Forget about them! Here's a new Jerry Bruckheimer production that places its secular faith in an almighty audience appetite for underdogs, sports, and dramas in which wrongs are righted by good-looking Americans."
1,"Sometimes it takes a sports movie to remind us how far we've come as a country -- and to marvel at how we got here at all, in our awkward combination of leaps and baby steps."
0,"By knocking the edges off Glory Road, Bruckheimer has turned a raw, compelling story into bland pudding."
1,"It's one helluva story, and if this moving, and even thrilling little movie finally brings Haskins and a truly great American sports story to light, then three cheers and hooray."
0,"Viewed as a re-creation of a watershed moment, Glory Road is sturdy, efficient, perhaps even worthy. Taken as cinema, however, it falls far short of inspiring."
1,This season's obligatory inspirational coach-centered sports movie finds its true story at a point where sports history intersects with the struggle for racial equality.
1,It's a terrific story of a team of Davids with hoop dreams running a gantlet of patrician Goliaths against a backdrop of momentous social change.
0,"Glory Road is a rah-rah piece of inspirationalism from Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who obviously wants to go one better on his Remember the Titans."
1,"Glory Road, a stand-up-and-cheer basketball tale taken from real life, is a drama that, almost inevitably, falls short of its subject. But what a subject!"
1,Glory Road plays fast and loose with some of the facts leading up to that event. But that certainly gives it dramatic punch.
1,"Where it succeeds is as the story of a chapter in history, the story of how one coach at one school arrived at an obvious conclusion and acted on it, and helped open college sports in the South to generations of African Americans."
1,"An appealing Disney sports movie that underplays its potential, Glory Road is at least a more satisfying basketball saga than last year's Coach Carter."
0,"Lacking the gritty reality of the 1994 documentary Hoop Dreams, this Jerry Bruckheimer film, directed by newcomer James Gartner, converts a year in the life of a basketball team into a very conventional triumph of the underdogs."
0,"OK, so you really don't need me to tell you about Glory Road if you've ever seen a sports movie before. Just get out your sports-movie-clich챕 checklist and a pencil."
0,"Glory Road abandons the clinical and compelling storytelling of the great recent Disney hockey movie Miracle, and aims instead for the contrived sentimentality of the slightly less great Remember the Titans."
1,"When a movie this corny still inspires, 'feel good' feels just right. Stay through the credits, when the 'real' coach and players talk, and you'll see the real Glory in this tale."
0,"Really, the material is ripe for Hoop Dreams documentary treatment, but instead we get hoop hyperbole from producer Jerry Bruckheimer."
1,"As Coach Haskins would say, it wins because it sticks to the fundamentals."
1,"Glory Road is a pure Hollywood fantasy. As movie fiction, however, I guess it is entertaining enough."
1,"In the end, a sports movie is only as good as the adrenalin rush it provides in the climactic match, and there, finally, Glory Road hits on all cylinders with nonstop action and a powerful emotional impact."
1,"It's a well-trod path, this 'via de basketball,' but Glory Road makes it worth the trip."
0,"If the facts of the story are essentially true, their presentation is as formulaic as ever."
1,"Glory Road is a can't-lose slam dunk of a movie, the sort of film that charges right over its minor flaws thanks to good intentions, fine execution and a breathless air of excitement."
1,"All involved with the project play the game with enthusiasm and purpose, which is all we really require from a committed team and an affirmative movie like this one."
1,"While Bruckheimer and Co. stretch the gospel theme too far and leave no emotional waypoint unmarked, Glory Road largely works."
0,A well-meaning movie that slides downhill like a runaway ball of cheese.
0,"Is it time already for another based-on-a-true-story feel-good Disney sports drama? Didn't that golf movie, The Greatest Game Ever Played, just come out?"
0,The team's accomplishments are here diluted into fodder for another of the producer's feel-good man-weepies.
1,Glory Road is a rousing and worthy tribute to one of the most important college basketball teams and one of the most important championship games of all time.
0,An underdog sports movie by the numbers.
0,"First-time director James Gartner observes all the rituals--the coach busting chops, the team sneaking out to party--but the players are indifferently characterized and the civil rights story has a fake Black History Month feel."
0,"Date Movie is stupefyingly unfunny in its attempts to mock romantic comedies, celebrities, reality TV shows and anything else that pops into the heads of its creators."
0,They manage to miss just about every target.
1,Any movie that tries to parody Kill Bill and Dodgeball in the same scene is OK by me.
0,Date Movie has a nascent sense of the absurd but doesn't know what to do with it.
0,It's not enough to just make the reference. You've got to make something funny out of the reference.
0,"It is ultimately an exercise in redundancy, since there's little point in creating a comedy that sends up other comedies. The end result is more a knockoff than a parody."
0,The movie sputters along on borrowed gags without improving them.
0,"Dudes, does a spoof count as a spoof if it's dumber and more obvious than the thing it's spoofing?"
0,"It's kind of amazing that a joke-a-second comedy like Date Movie doesn't contain a single laugh, but what's there has been so thoroughly focus-grouped and market-tested that no joy escapes the vacuum."
0,A lame pastiche of Hollywood romances.
0,"If their goal was to make a spoof film with heart, the end result has an irregular beat at best."
0,It takes a certain gall to pass off mere references as jokes.
0,"For anyone over 12 years old, this is a date to be missed."
1,"You have to be hungry for comedy that's salty and loud, that hits your palate with all the delicacy of hot grease. If you're in that mood, a handful of these jokes will likely be just what you crave."
0,This crass drag of a dud at best manages to elicit just a couple of half-hearted chuckles over the course of its 80-minute allotment.
0,These are sight gags best appreciated with a blindfold.
0,This is a deeply rubbish film.
0,[Mocks] movies that were much funnier than this one.
0,Date Movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. I really mean that.
1,Thoughtful and extremely well-made.
1,A thoroughgoing and affecting film on the nature and causes of the American military-industrial complex.
1,Jarecki's film forcefully argues that the much abused word freedom cannot paper over the conflicts between capitalism and democracy.
0,"It's unconvincing and ineffective; the many patches of ideological montage, growing like kudzu throughout the film, weaken the impact of its best moments."
1,"We're left with a vision of America grown accustomed, if not addictively numb, to the deadening spirit of war."
0,"... even those of radical political persuasion might find it hard to accept Mr. Jarecki's argument that American militarism is, underneath the talk about freedom and democracy, a simple question of dollars."
1,"It's thoughtful, and you have to take it seriously and with respect."
1,Extends beyond the titular question to touch on such issues as why we are hated so much and why we get it wrong so often.
1,"In addition to the usual pontificators like Gore Vidal, whose world weariness has assumed Olympian proportions, the director provides interviews with such right-wing counterparts as Richard Perle and William Kristol."
1,"Jarecki's well-argued, if demoralizing, documentary is a thoughtful discussion of current U.S. foreign policy and lessons not learned."
1,"Why We Fight wants to shake us up, and boy, does it ever."
1,"There have been so many protest pictures on the scene since the Iraq war began -- from Michael Moore, Robert Greenwald and other provocateurs -- that Why We Fight leaves you with a mild sense of deja vu rather than a fresh sense of outrage."
0,... this rehash of familiar pacifist arguments offers neither heat nor light.
1,"Whether we've reached the critical mass of ""misplaced power"" is the gist of the current national debate, and Why We Fight is a useful tool in that argument."
1,Compulsory viewing in an age when the war of words is every bit as entrenched (and fierce) as the one with weapons.
1,"I would like to believe that we still live in a world, and in a country were people will want to see something and will want to be informed."
1,"Stands as a class-act stylistic rebuttal to Fahrenheit 9/11 -- it asks questions rather than bludgeons us with ridicule, and it has the grace to hint that we can think for ourselves."
1,Memo to left-wing anti-Bushies: Stories like this work. Don't lecture. Tell stories! Much better!
1,The film is a clear-headed anomaly of reason that one hopes won't get lost in the bicker-and-scream shuffle of TV punditry.
1,"Even if one disagrees vehemently with Jarecki's interpretations of events and history, it's hard not to be impressed by the rigorousness with which he gathers his arguments."
1,"A somber polemic that presents a convincing case against using war as an economic booster -- although, Jarecki argues, that is precisely what the United States has been doing under every president since Truman."
1,There is plenty here that should worry members of both political parties.
0,"After Ike makes his point in the opening minutes, the film itself essentially just elaborates it."
1,"Why We Fight has passion and ambition and research to spare. Too bad Jarecki didn't take a somewhat fresher, more balanced approach in making his case."
1,"The strength of this documentary lies in its balance, or at least the careful appearance of balance. Both sides of the issue receive their due ..."
1,"Jarecki's thoughtful, nonconfrontational approach makes it absorbing viewing, regardless of whether or not you buy his arguments."
0,"Jarecki seems to have had his answers before asking the questions. He's a master at filtering, at choosing the best quotes to bolster his argument and at connecting dots that, perhaps, shouldn't be."
1,"Fluidly edited by Nancy Kennedy, Why We Fight interweaves these personal stories not only with history but with one another, yielding some choice ironies."
1,"It's impossible to imagine anyone, right-leaning or left, coming away from this hugely important documentary unshaken by its representation of the United States and its military establishment."
0,More leftist propaganda masquerading as documentary.
0,"Eugene Jarecki's Why We Fight takes on enough subjects to make five great documentaries, but as a result is so scattered that it doesn't quite make for one good one."
0,"The fact is, Jon Stewart on The Daily Show uncovers this same hypocrisy every night, and does it in two minutes with irony and humor, while Why We Fight attempts it with outrage and scolding."
1,Extremely timely and urgently relevant.
1,"A film that stands out for its passion, ambition and clarion-call sincerity, even amid the contemporary onslaught of political documentaries."
1,"Ultimately, Why We Fight reveals itself as yet another leftie doc with an anti-war agenda. But the mere fact that it takes time to ask questions and listen to opposing viewpoints sets it apart from the pack."
1,
1,"At last, a stylish and sexy comedy for grownups."
0,"It's worth noting that producing a farce in a way that's funny is a lost art, and director Lasse Hallstrm hasn't found it."
0,The clumsy staging might not grate so much if the tone weren't so self-congratulatory.
1,Casanova works because it gives in to its nuttier impulses instead of fighting them. It's an absurdly joyous bit of fluff.
1,Randy flirtations and elaborate masquerades to evade the sanctimonious powers-that-be are the cornerstone of this exuberant film.
0,"Casanova was such a genuinely fascinating person, so tireless, seductive, brilliant, revolutionary and daring, that Hallstrom's Casanova hardly does him justice."
1,Lasse Hallstrom's tale of an uncomplicated lover is a delightful respite from awards-season seriousness.
0,"The movie Casanova, starring Heath Ledger, not only fetters the randy Venetian in political correctness, it condemns him to dwell inside the modern equivalent of a bad Shakespeare play."
1,The movie sidesteps modern-day issues of political correctness raised by a story about a rogue who shamelessly uses women for his own amusement. This is all done for our amusement.
0,It requires imagination of a certain kind to transform the tale of the legendary lover Casanova into a bland romantic comedy.
0,Few pictures in recent memory have worked as laboriously as Lasse Hallstrom's new romantic farce to be a featherweight lark.
0,The movie treats trysting as comedy and yet is stingy with the laughs. An action-packed life is now the chaste story of a rake whose romantic reformation is supposed to make us swoon. Must love dog? No thanks.
0,Don't confuse the 18th-century Venetian setting in Casanova with sophistication.
0,A period romp that tries too hard.
1,"In the exhilarating Casanova, giddy shenanigans effectively set off the dangerous, darker impulses of human nature."
1,Hallstrom gives us a genial interpretation and a supremely good-humored film.
1,"Casanova relies heavily on charm, and it's not a case of misplaced confidence. The legendary rogue's saga, at least in this fresh incarnation, is indeed a charmer."
0,"The movie contains so little sexual content, it seems pre-edited for viewing on airplanes, or perhaps balloon rides like the fake one taken high above Venice by stars Heath Ledger and Sienna Miller."
1,A handsome chunk of widescreen entertainment that's as nimble as its rakish hero.
0,"Pretty as the picture is, only Platt's engaging performance keeps it from fading out."
0,"Ledger is no Casanova, and the movie is not what it should be, but once that is accepted, the movie can be appreciated for the jolly, lightweight thing it is."
0,"One would expect Casanova, a movie about the storied loverboy of 18th-century Venice, to be wicked, ribald fun. One would be wrong."
1,It's a breezy fling that showcases the lighter side of Ledger.
0,A forgettable movie but a memorable celluloid poster for Venice.
0,Casanova is just plain ordinary.
1,"This is the very definition of an entertaining period piece romp. It's a romp, I tell ya!"
1,Is it Oscar bait? Not in the least. But it's a great date flick and perfect for a time full of all those 'serious' films.
0,"I admit that the picture is handsomely designed in gold and pale blue, but none of the tumult and pomp have any dramatic, comic, or erotic effect whatsoever."
1,The great discovery of this Casanova is Hallstrm's recovered capacity for play.
0,"Although Casanova is far from a stinker, I can't join in the chorus of praise for what is essentially a coy farce replete with arch performances and even archer dialogue."
1,This is easily the liveliest Hallstrom has been in almost a decade.
0,"The whimsical plot, involving Casanova's seduction of a cross-dressing feminist, isn't helped by director Lasse Hallstrom's leaden hand."
0,The sticky sweet stuff in the middle traps history's greatest lover and slows the whole affair to a crawl.
0,"The irony of [Sienna] Miller co-starring in a film about the world's most notorious lothario aside, there's not much to love about Casanova."
1,"Despite its oh-so deviant title character, Casanova is a harmless bon-bon, a breezy period farce that mimics lesser Shakespeare and a look that recalls Amadeus or Shakespeare in Love."
1,"A ribald, witty costume comedy filled with delightful performances and wily plot turns, this is the sort of film that makes you wonder why more films like this aren't made."
1,"Casanova finds [director] Hallstrom more inspired, or at least lively and engaged, than he has been in years, and he's in the company of the actor of the moment."
0,"Aside from having little to say, the new edition of Casanova tries so hard to serve a crowd-pleasing buffet that it turns into a scattershot series of unrewarding nibbles."
0,"There's less sexiness in the awful Casanova than in the downbeat, doomed gay love story featuring Ledger in Brokeback Mountain."
1,"Overall, Casanova is silly but amusing."
0,"Casanova is a silly film. Half Carry On, half Shakespearean comedy, everyone in it is perfectly nice and should reassemble to make a great Twelfth Night."
0,"The story isn't inherently funny, relevant, or convincing."
0,"Something tells me that the original dialogue, replaced here by references to M.C. Hammer and The Shining, would have added a little to the movie's limited charms."
0,"The key frame animation, based on three-dimensional models, is rudimentary, with none of the characters proving visually arresting."
0,"In attempting to turn a tiny Anglo-Franco amusement into a full-blown Yankee extravaganza, The Weinstein Co. has managed to choke every last bit of charm out of the characters and their setting, no mean feat for a show this enchanting."
0,"It's a movie that scrounges so desperately for laughs, it features both a flatulent moose and a flatulent train."
0,"It's easily the worst kid's movie since Spy Kids 3-D, a confusing blur of a magical quest based on an ancient British stop-motion animation TV show."
0,"Doogal has a few moments of wit, but they're largely lost thanks to inconsistent direction and an uncertainty about who or what the movie is for."
0,"The titular canine hero has all the appeal of a talking bathmat. The animation is ugly, and the American re-write -- which, in typical Hollywood fashion, confuses topicality with humor, as if simply namedropping is enough -- adds nothing."
0,"In Doogal, setting the world right again involves a badly paced quest for three diamonds, assorted jokes that don't land, and a daringly incoherent climactic confrontation."
0,"Doogal is an exceeding lame animated feature about a bunch of kids trapped on a magical carousel -- but it's adults forced to sit through this slow-moving, G-rated Lord of the Rings knockoff who will be begging for mercy."
0,A dreadful animated movie stuffed with bad puns and little internal logic.
0,Eighty-five minutes you'll never get back.
0,"If we keep saying, 'Yeah, it's lousy, but there's so much worse stuff out there,' and we keep sighing, rolling our eyes, and going anyway, we'll keep getting slapdash, manipulative product like this. Kids deserve better. So do dogs."
0,"Hungering for more references to the 'Wassup' commercials, Dr. Phil, 'Bling Bling,' The Lord Of The Rings, MC Hammer, or The Matrix? Don't worry, Doogal contains nods to all of these."
0,"Where is it written that 4-year-olds don't deserve a good story, decent characters, and a modicum of coherence?"
0,"The laziest, most disheartening kind of animated children's film."
0,The slapdash dialogue and smug vocal talent detract from the visual appeal of the most energetic sequences (like a raucous train chase) and what's left of Danot's designs.
0,Someone should tell the poor guy that being gay doesn't have to mean being this lame.
1,"Though the characters and plot are all paint-by-numbers, Summer Storm is still a fairly charming look at what it's like for a typical teen jock to admit he's not so typical, after all."
1,"Tale of a high-school rowing team's captain going through major changes during a week-long training retreat is routine in some aspects, but compensates via psychologically sharp writing and performances."
1,One of the film's major assets is Stadlober's winningly natural performance -- his moody charisma is irresistible.
0,"Summer Storm is another of those soft-core, simple-minded stories about a geeky young gay man (Robert Stadlober as Tobi) struggling with his sexuality over the course of a long, hot, sexed-up summer."
0,"For a small coming-of-age film, this picture is remarkably well photographed and acted. But the single-mindedness with which it seems determined to have almost everyone rowing in the same sexual direction finally becomes a bit oppressive."
0,"Summer Storm is a contemporary teen summer romance with a modern sexual twist -- though in many ways, it's just the same old malarkey."
1,"Kreutzpainter limns his multifarious characters with an amiable, unforced humor and an authentic feel for the ways in which good kids respond to peer pressure with less-than-admirable behavior."
1,"Equal parts earnest and endearing, Bavarian director Marco Kreuzpaintner's gay romance tackles its adolescent heartaches with unusual compassion."
0,"The slo-mo opening, accompanied by sappy music, tells you everything you need to know about Summer Storm, an uninspired gay coming-of-age import from Germany."
0,"While it has little in it that hasn't been covered by other coming-out movies, it's pleasant enough."
1,"Stadlober, a young Austrian actor cast in the leading role, is charming enough to survive most of the movie's labored attempts to lighten up."
1,"This gay coming-of-age film from Germany ultimately has few original aspects, but it is an intelligently wrought drama that makes it a respectable entry in the genre."
1,"It's sunny and frothy, with odd laugh-out-loud moments."
0,Its coming-of-age yarn goes nowhere beyond inevitably out of a closet.
1,Writer-director Craig Chester's debut is truly enjoyable.
0,Adam & Steve strikes an unsatisfying balance between serious romantic texture and outright farce.
0,"There is an underlying story here, and some comic ideas, that in the hands of a better director (or more ruthless editor) could have become an entertaining romantic comedy."
0,"Who said mainstream Hollywood has a monopoly on dumb, gross-out farces? The gay, independent comedy Adam & Steve is as crude and nonsensical as any number of B-list studio equivalents."
0,"Adam & Steve is a mostly bland, sporadically crude, by-the-numbers romantic comedy about two gay men in love."
1,One of the most fundamental rights of man is the right to simply have a frivolous good time. And that's a rainbow flag that Adam & Steve proudly waves high.
1,"Often charming and funny, though sometimes quite gross."
1,"Co-stars Parker Posey and Chris Kattan offer minor diversions, but the humor never rises to the quality any New Yorker, regardless of sexual orientation, would expect."
1,"Much of Craig Chester's good-hearted love story Adam & Steve is silly and contrived, but the film boasts four engaging actors, including Chester."
0,"For every shtick that works, there are two that don't. Adam & Steve is not the knee-slapper it wants to be, but it's endearing nonetheless."
1,"Plays as urban farce, but thanks to first-time director Chester's light touch and affectionally observant eye and ear, it's also a genuinely affecting love story."
1,"Material is uneven, but rhythm and pacing keep action moving smartly."
0,"Pure amateur-hour stuff: a low-budget, poorly written gay movie that revolves around a crude joke and repeatedly delivers embarrassment when it's supposed to be offering humor."
1,[Chester] and the goofy Gets make a likable comedy team.
0,"Adam & Steve mainly goes to prove that indie gay romantic comedies can be just as witless, vulgar and over the top as their straight, major studio counterparts."
0,Starting your film with a display of public incontinence isn't the best way to win over the audience.
1,"Clever, liberatingly silly and sweet."
1,Dellal milks the funny business for maximum laughs without making any of the central characters devolve into caricatures.
1,"The kind of drama that British television used to do so well, a well-constructed, smartly observed story of ordinary people learning how to communicate with one another."
1,"Though the story is filled with familiar strokes, sensitive direction and quality acting give it emotional depth."
1,A pleasantly predictable film which ultimately demonstrates rather less ambition than its protagonist.
0,"Gaby Dellal's cynically mushy film, like The Full Monty and its ilk, is best savored only by its target demo: middle-classers who see one imported film a year."
0,[Scottish actor Peter Mullan] saves a drama tangled in the seaweed of life lessons from drowning in pathos.
1,Much of On A Clear Day volleys between quirky and sentimental.
1,"Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, On a Clear Day follows a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel."
0,"For all its exertions, the film spends most of its time merely treading water."
1,"If it weren't for Scotsman Peter Mullan, who's wonderful as Frank Redmond, On a Clear Day would be intolerably pat."
0,"The recent Anthony Hopkins film The World's Fastest Indian, a charming true story loaded with nutty details, painted a similar picture of an older man's quest, but with much brighter colors than the gray tones of On a Clear Day."
1,"Sweet-natured, if somewhat familiar, On a Clear Day features fine performances by Mullan, Blethyn and Sives. Dellal and cinematographer David Johnson paint an inviting picture of Glasgow."
1,"Mullan makes Frank a complex, proud and wounded man, a reluctant dreamer who is both melancholic and inspiring. Not a great film, but all the performances are smart."
1,"On a Clear Day isn't the best of the genre, but I can't deny it got to me."
1,Mullan always looks as if he's about to explode -- sometimes he does -- and he's in good enough shape to make the aquatic conceit believable.
1,"The symbolism in On a Clear Day makes it more than just another underdog story, and the movie is less reliant on warm and fuzzy Hollywood- isms than other films of its kind."
1,It presses most of the right feel-good buttons.
0,Like a soggy and less compelling iteration of The Full Monty.
0,The movie reaches for an emotional climax that is simply beyond the filmmakers' grasp.
0,"A lesser film, kindhearted, a wee bit weepy and a wee bit trite."
0,Nothing in On a Clear Day is especially compelling. The movie doesn't dig deep enough.
1,"Does any of this work? Sure, but only through the graces of a cast that knows better than to play to our hearts."
1,"A thoughtful, thoroughly engaging portrait of fractured family and friends pulling together for an impossible dream."
0,Clear Day isn't terribly engaging.
1,"... despite its familiarity, it works, mostly on the strength of a fine performance by the Scottish actor Peter Mullan."
0,The recycled spectacle of yet another downsized U.K. working-class type being reduced to an act of feel-good against-all-odds crowd-pleasing redemption.
0,"The wonder here, if not the redemption, is that so many toil so hard to make this saccharine stuff palatable."
0,Dramatically pallid and unconvincing.
0,"What Clean needed was a little more dirt, or at least some of the grit that the addict fears will never entirely wash off."
0,"It's not so much a movie in three acts as three movies stuffed into a single casing, and often showing the strain."
1,"[Cheung] catalogs every up and down on the carousel of a recovering drug addict with a mix of despair, pain, strength, realism and poignancy that is mesmerizing."
1,Not your average divorce gift.
0,"All the same and despite Cheung's deserved Best Actress win at Cannes, the feigned intimacy with inexpressible bio-emotional conditions like addiction and detox leaves us, as it almost always does, on the outside."
1,"As Emily's tale rolls out, it does so in fashion devoid of cliche and convention, toying with time and portraying a heroine who provokes contempt as easily as empathy."
1,"The film gets its distinction from the performances by Cheung and Nolte, whose scenes together are suffused with loss and unexpected mutual compassion."
1,"Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte seem unlikely co-stars, but co-star they do in Clean, giving gritty performances under the direction of Frenchman Olivier Assayas, Cheung's ex-husband."
1,"As evidenced by the best actress award she earned at Cannes, Cheung rises to the occasion ..."
1,Clean is one of the few fiction films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction.
0,Mr. Assayas has given us an international soap opera with little or no dramatic substance.
1,The chief pleasure in the picture is Nick Nolte's performance.
1,"One of those movies that's slightly off the mark in ways that are hard to put a finger on, but it is shot so soulfully and features such beautiful performances that it's easy to forgive the occasional false note."
1,The film that showed the world Maggie Cheung is more than just a strikingly beautiful face.
1,"Assayas' tale of the difficult search for redemption is less a standard road-to-sobriety story than a chance to marvel, close-up, at Cheung."
0,"Despite Cheung's efforts (she won the best actress award at Cannes in 2004) and a strong and subtle supporting performance by Nick Nolte, the story could have used a good dose of adrenaline to keep it from often seeming lifeless."
1,"In Clean, Assayas returns to his comfort zone -- the world of appealing young people with interestingly chaotic lives -- and views it through the eyes of a woman who doesn't belong there anymore."
0,"It's the moral journey of Nolte's character that is the real story in Clean, but Assayas instead focuses on the manipulative habits of an addict, resulting in a mannered study of narcissism and self-pity."
0,"Assayas tells her tale sympathetically, but this sad saga lacks substance. He sells the wretch but not the redemption."
1,It's a globe-trotting drama with more than a touch of Wim Wenders whim to it.
1,"It's a complex, very successful portrayal of an addictive, selfish, volatile soul who knows she might be running out of chances at a decent life."
1,Emily is played by Maggie Cheung with such intense desperation that she won the best actress award at Cannes 2004. Only a few actresses in the world could have handled this role from a technical point of view.
1,"The film locates its heart muscle, however, in its performances."
1,"It's a joy to watch the characters in this grown-up drama interact, their exchanges laced with anger and doubt, sadness and regret."
1,"There are so many quiet, understated miracles unfolding in Clean that all you can do is watch in awe and amazement."
1,It helps -- immensely -- that Cheung is pitch-perfect. Her performance is heartbreaking.
1,Maggie Cheung gives an astonishingly complex performance as a junkie rock star trying to clean up her act.
1,"Cheung makes her character work, despite a weak plot and script, both by director Assayas."
0,A disappointment.
1,"It is not filled with quick cutting or gimmicky editing, but Jerry Schatzberg's direction is so confident that we cover the ground effortlessly."
1,A gruelling but highly responsible film about the influence of heroin on a New York street romance.
0,
1,"Schatzberg doesn't romanticize addicts' troubles; with a tender but unsparing eye, he spins visual variations on shambling degradation and transient relief."
0,"For those who enjoy fashion-model-looking twentysomethings yelling at each other in bathrooms while doing too much cocaine, voila! Heaven is a place called London."
0,"Syd's emotional tailspin is embarrassingly banal, and his assertion that 'everybody here hates me' quickly applies to the audience as well."
0,An aggravating twerp of an indie.
0,"A misfired attempt at provocation and the exploration of philosophical thought, London is little more than an immature display of male bonding on speed."
0,"I have seen all of these actors on better days in better movies, and I may have a novena said for them."
0,The title refers to the name of one of a grouping of some of the most numbingly self-absorbed and obnoxious characters ever assembled in a single film.
0,"Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy spends hours in a bathroom snorting a mother lode of cocaine while annoying everyone within earshot with his tales of woe. Sounds like a great idea for a movie. Let's do it!"
0,"London has nothing to do with London. It has nothing to do with anything, except the same heavy-breathing preppy Walter Mitty fantasy that drove A Million Little Pieces."
0,"Don't you hate it when you're holed up in a bathroom with two egocentric guys snorting coke and kibitzing about the meaning of life and their failing love lives? Me, too."
0,"Richards mistakes boorishness for drama, and the seemingly tendentious desire to be off-putting succeeds all too well."
0,"'You are so annoying!' our hero screams in the heroine's face, halfway through London. 'You are 10 times more annoying than me!' our heroine quickly answers. They're both right."
0,It's not so interesting to watch people on cocaine babble back and forth at each other.
0,London's pretensions far outstrip its dorm-level contemplation of life's big issues.
0,You should avoid it like a bad case of whooping cough.
0,Be very afraid.
1,"The tension never falters as we gaze in wonder at Tracy, seen floating literally in a swimming pool and figuratively through life, and wondering if she will plunge into the deep end once again."
1,A canny mixture of social drama and crime thriller.
1,"While Little Fish takes a turn for the generic in its final act, solid acting, an atmospheric soundtrack, and flare-filled cinematography more beautiful than an Apple screensaver are enough to keep the film afloat."
1,"The actors are terrific, especially Weaving, who plays bottoming out as a tragedy spiked with gallows humor, and Blanchett, who digs deep into the booby-trapped nature of recovery. The revelation, however, is Rowan Woods, a major filmmaker in the making."
1,"Cate Blanchett sinks into the role of a recovering drug addict in a thorny, compelling drama from Australia."
0,"If you say you'd watch Cate Blanchett in anything, here's your chance to prove it."
1,"A small film with a big cast, Little Fish is notable for its performances."
1,"It's a tidy showcase for Cate Blanchett as a recovering drug addict struggling to throw off the shackles of her past, but Sam Neill and Hugo Weaving also shine ..."
1,"It's a sober, sensitive film ... about degrees of dependency, grief, guilt, recrimination and recuperation."
1,The actors give performances of intense naturalness.
1,It's assured filmmaking and proof that school isn't always the best days of your life.
0,"The milieu owes something to Lindsay Anderson's If.... , but Evil is less anti-authority than pro-confrontation."
1,Watching this time bomb tick away is never less than riveting.
0,The movie is as blunt as its title.
1,"Wilson is a powerful presence as the slow-burning but, when roused, very violent Erik, while Lundstrom movingly portrays the vulnerable Pierre."
0,Comes perilously close to making Erik's suffering at the hands of sadistic upperclassmen seem almost fetishistic.
1,Hafstrom ... keeps us guessing as he confidently builds suspense.
0,"Hafstrom never finds the shades in his morality tale, so while Wilson is an intensely charismatic actor, all he can do is respond to relentless, escalating tortures. It's immensely unpleasant for him, and, frankly, not a whole lot better for us."
1,"Although Evil eventually suffers from its heavy-handed treatment of its subject, it is a well-made and engrossing melodrama."
0,"The way it plays out, Evil feeds the audience's bloodlust as much as it decries the worst acts of its characters."
1,"Movies like Evil entertain us by serving sweet revenge on a platter, and director Mikael Hfstrm manipulates emotions more intelligently than most."
1,"Wilson, who plays Erik, had never been in a film before Evil -- which was nominated for a best foreign-language Oscar in 2004 -- and there's no reason that he can't make many more of them."
0,Hafstrm's dramatic sense is ... pedestrian and snail's-pace obvious.
1,"Extremely watchable, even if it never goes as deep as it should."
1,"The Devil and Daniel Johnston is a movie about a man whose demons live with him always, but who has somehow found a way of speaking that can still be heard above the din in his head."
1,"Pic is particularly well-crafted, managing to avoid the ambulance-chasing tenor that might easily have turned this into a voyeuristic freakshow."
1,The documentary holds no illusions about insanity as a career move; there's a whiff of the freak show in Johnston's latter-day concerts but never in Feuerzeig's approach.
1,The Devil and Daniel Johnston is a fascinating and lovingly crafted musical documentary that nevertheless misunderstands its own subject.
1,"Director Jeff Feuerzeig, extensively utilizing home movies, chronicles the eerie and oddly inspiring story of Johnston's ongoing battles to survive -- both as artist and human being."
1,The romantic cliche that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about the musician Daniel Johnston.
1,It's the way Feuerzeig walks with him on the line between creativity and madness that digs this haunting and hypnotic film into your memory.
1,Returns repeatedly to the tangled relationship between hipsters and the out-of-control oddballs they enable.
1,The Devil and Daniel Johnston is undoubtedly the best movie anyone could have made about this unwitting practitioner of 'outsider' art.
1,"As its title suggests, the picture is something of a ballad, an ode to an elusive character who's both quintessentially human and so outlandish he almost seems unreal."
1,Feuerzeig paints a loving portrait of the up-and-down life of the troubled 45-year-old -- sort of a poor man's Brian Wilson.
1,Everything a good documentary should be.
0,"Devil turns out to be too indulgent and worshipful a film to justify its length (one hour and 50 minutes, including an interminable section on Johnston in high school), much less hold our attention for the duration."
1,"[The film] may be a paean to a lost 'genius,' but it is also a gritty, involving, warts-and-all tale of celebrity and psychosis that leaves a likely unanswerable question: Were the naive songs of Johnston's youth a window into his soul, or his disease?"
1,"It doesn't condescend [to Johnston], it doesn't exploit him. It just tells us about his life."
1,"Whether Johnston is a genius or a wonderful anomaly remains to be seen, but director Jeff Feuerzeig has stitched together a detailed portrait of the artist's life and music that is never less than compelling."
1,"Feuerzeig's film is as good a portrait of the artist as a beloved basket case as you'll see, but it's kept from greatness by the questions it refuses to ask itself."
1,"Feuerzeig recounts it all with clear-eyed candor, turning to Johnston's battered friends and family for insight and empathy and to Johnston's tapes and drawings for an inside look at his illness."
1,"Regardless of how you feel about Johnston's art, The Devil and Daniel Johnston is worth seeing as a poignant portrait of a troubled life, still in the making."
1,"Johnston's fringe existence may not speak to the most universal of truths, but the man certainly isn't cut from a cookie-cutter mold."
1,"Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at Sundance 2005 for this film, has started with a subject who has filmed himself and been filmed by others for more than 20 years."
1,An inspired piece of work by someone who knows and admires Mr. Johnston but doesn't cover up the warts. It's also the rare documentary possessed with an artistry that transcends its subject.
0,"Perhaps Feuerzeig wanted to get away from the stereotypical 'talking head' interview, but by having the subject stop periodically to rinse and spit?"
1,"A searing, compassionate portrait of chronic mental illness."
1,"Devil leads us into that dark, uncharted valley where evil, genius, divine inspiration, insanity -- and other unfathomable mysteries -- commingle."
1,This well-done documentary will explain why Johnston has never been able to rise above cult status ...
1,"Feuerzeig was able to fashion such a thorough, engaging film partly because aficionados such as Lee Renaldo of Sonic Youth shot so much footage of Johnston performing and acting out."
1,"Like Capturing the Friedmans, Devil is loaded with revealing footage, rife with psychodrama, including a creepy home movie in which the teenage Johnston plays himself and his overbearing mother."
1,... an uncomfortably fascinating document of a man whose bipolar disorder and artistic ambitions are inextricably connected.
1,To share Feuerzeig's loving investigation is to share an insightful study of the destructive and creative capabilities of the mind.
1,"As a demonstration of how to put a life on screen, it is exemplary in its thoroughness and willingness to allow a multiplicity of views."
1,The troubled singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston is the subject of an entertaining documentary.
1,"Rock 'n' roll's capacity for recycling legend means the stories of Johnston's life, and the way in which they're told, could easily fall into clich. Instead they are original, engrossing and sometimes heartbreaking."
1,I found the documentary surprisingly diverting as a case study.
1,"A heartbreaking, yet strangely uplifting and inspirational, exploration of the fine line between genius and madness, and how sometimes, one becomes impossible to discern from the other."
1,The Devil and Daniel Johnston is an unflinching yet loving look at the outsider musician's life. It's also the most revealing look at genius and mental illness since Terry Zwigoff's 1994 documentary Crumb.
0,... there's the assembly-line predictability of it all.
0,... the extreme levels of gratuitous gore also make the picture ... difficult to recommend.
0,... the appropriately named Mr. Dark has no use for actors as anything other than body-bag fillers.
0,... generic and predictable ...
0,"Outside the wrestling hook, See No Evil is a boilerplate bloodfeast featuring the usual mix of stylish camerawork and screaming sound cues."
0,"The madman is played by the single-name professional wrestler Kane, who has all the acting skills of a fire hydrant. But why waste good acting on a contrived, unimaginative story?"
0,"Grim, bloody and relentless, without even a spark of fun or intelligence, Evil is barely good enough for late-night cable."
0,... I see no originality in See No Evil.
0,"With its run-down, abandoned setting, which is lousy with roaches, rats and flies, it's just dark, dirty and gross."
0,"Although much blood is spilled and splattered, precious little suspense is generated during See No Evil."
0,"If there were an award for mangiest set decoration, See No Evil -- a routine slasher film set in a condemned hotel -- might cop it."
1,"The gilt-and-grime setting is eerily atmospheric, and screenwriter Dan Madigan has a nicely sick sense of humor."
0,"See No Evil is proficient junk, which makes it something of an improvement over recent horrors like An American Haunting."
0,Comes coated in several layers of sleaze and grime...
1,The movie slices through the cobwebs of history to seek the heart of the young Austrian princess whom 18th century political diplomacy thrust into a maelstrom of court intrigue and poisoned personal relationships without even asking if she minded.
1,Let them have eye candy pretty much sums up Sofia Coppola's approach to her revisionist and modernist take on the famous royal airhead who in the end lost her head.
1,Ms. Coppola and her colleagues have also taken an anachronistic approach to her material with an anarchic pop-music score suggesting the complacent spirit of a contemporary spoiled teenager infatuated with the glistening surfaces of her generation.
0,"The overwrought director sees Marie as France's most misunderstood monarch, but provides nary one sane member of the court who misunderstands her."
1,"This is one of the most immediate, personal costume dramas ever made, and so it's not unseemly to consider how the writer-director and her heroine overlap."
1,"A graceful, charming, and sometimes witty confection -- at least for its first hour."
1,"Highly theatrical and yet also intimate and informal, Marie Antoinette lets its story slink almost casually through its lovingly composed and rendered images."
1,"A buoyant, passionately sympathetic dream-bio."
1,"Pouring Coca-Cola in the cabernet, Sofia Coppola's dazzling Marie Antoinette couldn't be more anachronistic if it showed the queen of France saying, 'Let them eat sushi.' Coppola works in weird ways, but the real Versailles was so much weirder."
0,"Dazed and confused, it feels like a teenager's diary, read aloud over some awesome mixtape."
0,"The one, transfixing virtue of Marie Antoinette is its unembarrassed devotion to the superficial. There is no morality at play here, no agony other than boredom, and, until the last half hour, not a shred of political sense."
1,"This mightn't be food for the soul, but it is a pleasurable sugar rush."
0,"This is a movie that never gets to the point, perhaps because it doesn't recognize what the point is."
1,The work of a mature filmmaker who has identified and developed a new cinematic vocabulary to describe a new breed of post-postpostfeminist woman.
1,"[Coppola] transports you to a place you've never been, makes you feel a sensation that's familiar, yet leaves you different than you were two hours earlier."
0,"Though Dunst looks the part and stunningly carries off foot-high powdered wigs and lavish costumes, her flat affect and simpering voice don't conjure up the requisite sense of arrogant power, corruption and narcissism."
0,"Marie Antoinette, which was shot at Versailles, looks absolutely sumptuous, but is, ultimately as substantial as a bonbon."
0,"A largely static, desperately pseudo-hip attempt to reconstruct the events leading up to the French Revolution from the vantage point of a 1980s punk rocker."
1,A startlingly original and beautiful pop reverie that comes very close to being transcendent.
0,"Just because the film's heroine has nothing to say about politics, revolutionary or otherwise, doesn't justify Coppola being similarly dumbstruck."
1,"What's surprising is that, by the end, Marie Antoinette, for all its folderol, is quite touching."
1,"Coppola brilliantly conjures the young queen's insular world, in which she was both isolated and claustrophobically scrutinized. While not celebrating Marie Antoinette's reign, Coppola clearly sympathizes with a girl who was less heedless than naive."
1,"Insouciant but never cavalier, Coppola's latest effort should prove definitively she's a talent in her own right."
0,"The movie falls apart when the peasants storm the palace in 1789, an event completely outside Coppola's frame of reference -- at least until the Cannes premiere."
1,"The prettiest movie of the year so far, Marie Antoinette is also one of the most thrillingly original."
0,Perhaps Marie Antoinette can best be appreciated in the haphazard way you savor a pop song that's about nothing beyond its own expression of energy and flash.
0,Is it possible to make a film that evokes both Barry Lyndon and National Lampoon's European Vacation? Sofia Coppola has had a decent stab at it.
0,It's history written with truffles.
0,"The director squanders a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to film on the grounds and inside the Palace of Versailles. It's the trappings we get, in richly reproduced costumes and all-over gilt furniture, at the expense of any substance."
1,"Little happens for much of Marie Antoinette, but Coppola is a visual storyteller, and with her first big canvas she creates a giddy world at Versailles in color and light."
0,"Coppola's queen experiences no inner transformation or redemption because, in this telling, she's in no need of it. She's cool to begin with."
1,"With lyrical intelligence and scrappy wit, Coppola creates a luscious world to get lost in. It's a pleasure."
1,"This is just a lark, a heavy-handed one without the heart of even the bad histories which gave us a Marie who said (as she never did) Let them eat cake."
0,Dunst plays Marie Antoinette as if she's seen the future and it's Paris Hilton.
1,"Instead of turning her inside out, Coppola illustrates just how ordinary she was and how her insular world prevented her from understanding the events that eventually would end her life."
0,"There's not much meat at this banquet, only sweets."
0,Here's one thing about Marie Antoinette: It sure is easy to watch. And here's another: It's even easier to forget.
1,"She was born into fabulous wealth and fame. By the time she was a teenager, her name was well-known to both the public and the well-to do. So is it any wonder Sofia Coppola wanted to do a movie about Marie Antoinette?"
0,"Although it is purposely devoid of substance, it is still devoid of substance."
0,"By the end, the sad, preposterous emptiness of the court has overtaken the movie and turned it from a potentially intriguing drama into a forlorn, muzzy daydream."
0,"The result is a silly piece of costume jewelry called Marie Antoinette, and no, the soldering of a new-wave-revival soundtrack with 18th-century Versailles is not interesting enough to save this bauble."
0,"The movie ends as it started, with Marie in a carriage, unaware of the fate we know awaits her. It's the last in a long line of things the movie neither shows or tells us."
1,Every criticism I have read of this film would alter is fragile magic and reduce its romantic and tragic poignancy to the level of an instructional film.
1,"Given Coppola's fashion-first approach, it's a miracle the film doesn't feel more like a long perfume ad. But the movie has atmosphere, beauty, spirit, and exquisite production design, photography, and editing."
1,Coppola's anthem for doomed youth has its own affecting cadence.
0,"It's very pretty and occasionally amusing but also dreadfully dull for long, long stretches."
1,Stunningly original...The masterstroke of Marie Antoinette is how Coppola connects the social order to sexual servitude.
0,"Sadly, there's no wit here. Once Rip Torn's Louis XV has departed the scene, you can't find an actor able to deliver a line without sounding embarrassed about having to mean it."
0,"The ultimate failing of Marie Antoinette, fun for all its emptiness, is Coppola's coy eschewal of the queen's public demise."
1,"Whatever the film's structural failings and historical gaps, it's great to see such a distinctive directorial vision coming out of Hollywood."
1,Drawn from Antonia Fraser's biography - or riffing on it - this slyly seditious comedy escorts sacred verities of French history and culture to the scaffold.
0,"Marie Antoinette is about confinement in a gilded cage, and, perversely or not, shows itself far more interested in the cage than in the prisoner."
1,"Sofia Coppola's giddy, girly and defiantly revisionist Marie Antoinette didn't deserve the reaction it got in Cannes earlier this year."
1,"Hardly a winner, but far from a bore draw."
0,A cliche-a-minute howler.
0,A slickly mounted slice of can-do nonsense set in the world of British soccer.
0,"Sometimes the first movie in a trilogy isn't that good, but it fails just nobly enough to still make you curious enough to maybe see the sequels."
0,Goal! The Dream Begins follows a young Mexican soccer whiz from Los Angeles to England and a tryout with Newcastle United.
1,"Even though Goal! takes its own sweet time getting there, the story of Santiago Munez (played by Spanish-language TV star Kuno Becker) finally arrives at the heartwarming uplift to which all sports movies are required to aspire."
1,"Hard to ignore the cliches and the in-your-face uplift. But the details, gritty and otherwise, feel right."
1,"Goal! The Dream Begins is an inspirational sports movie, but I liked it anyway."
0,"In the end, I can't think of a movie that matters less than Just My Luck. It's just negligible."
1,"Predictable Goal! The Dream Begins may not be the stuff of everyone's reveries, but the film is capably acted and somewhat inspiring."
1,"No matter where the film carries you, it always gets back to the love of the game."
1,The best American-made sports film since Miracle.
0,"Disney goes to the sports-movie-formula well once too often with Goal! The Dream Begins, which is essentially The Rookie or The Greatest Game Ever Played on a soccer pitch."
0,"It's hard to make Bend It Like Beckham look like high drama, but this movie almost manages."
1,"The pro-soccer circuit is convincingly portrayed, and at its best moments the dialogue is as bright as Newcastle's skies aren't."
1,Danny Cannon's Goal! The Dream Begins is a sports movie for people who may not care about sports but can't resist a heart-tugging underdog story.
1,Goal! is right up there with the terrific Akeelah and the Bee (another underdog now in theaters) in the way it draws you in and keeps you rooting for its lower class but highly talented hero.
0,"There's plenty of fat to cut from Goal!, which would have been a stronger story at a lean, mean 90 minutes."
1,"For all its familiar ticks -- of which there are many -- Goal! works some underdog magic in taking aspiring footballer Santiago Munez from Mexico to Los Angeles and then across the big pond to Newcastle, England."
0,"Handsomely shot and with a likable lead in Kuno Becker, it also suffers from a script so outrageously generic you could buy it at Costco."
0,"Goal! is dippy and predictable, and it never once surprises."
1,"Still works reasonably well in spite of itself, mostly due to the damnable reliability of these clich챕s when they're put across with enough skill and conviction."
1,"... it is good and caring work, with more human detail than we expect."
0,"Goal! is filled with cringe-inducing scenes we've seen before many, many times."
0,
0,Everything here is beyond predictable.
0,"The combination of button-pushing uplift, sundry sweeping helicopter shots and a bombastic score that sounds like it came on a free transfer from a Tony Scott movie proves as resistibly synthetic as the CGI-enhanced heroics on the pitch."
0,[The film] far exceeds the limits of how far a one-joke comedy can be extended.
1,"We can hear the French barking ""auteur"" already... Beneath the profanely preposterous premise, Stay is a rather sweet and conventional love story that perambulates around the notions of trust and acceptance."
1,"[Goldthwait] handles it beautifully, crafting from such rough stuff something astoundingly sweet and sharply funny about forgiveness, unconditional love, tenderness, and the things we hide just to get ourselves from one day to the next."
1,A scrappily funny and observant takeoff on the secrets that complete even the ''normal'' among us.
1,Goldthwait -- his motives always suspect -- has made a very watchable movie out of a very strange subject.
1,"The uncomfortable message sent by Bobcat Goldthwait's lean, subversive comedy Sleeping Dogs Lie is how easy it is to gross out people who think they're so swinging and cool."
1,"Rather than the escalating gross-out spectacular it could have been, Sleeping Dogs Lie is an unexpectedly thoughtful look at what it takes to make relationships work."
0,"Sleeping Dogs Lie is worse than offensive, it's boring, and these busy days that's really unforgivable."
1,Sleeping Dogs Lie does collar big laughs for anyone who isn't skeeved out by the whole idea.
0,"[Director] Goldthwait explores his themes more thoughtfully than you'd expect, but ultimately, we know just how things will end. And what's subversive about that?"
1,"Possesses a quick wit and an endearing tenderness toward Amy as honesty wrecks her life. It's sweet, doggone it."
0,"An inexplicable sleeper hit on the festival circuit, this one-joke movie's bestiality premise is all you'll remember after the credits roll."
1,"A warm, mature, thought-provoking film that is, at times, surreal, often hilarious and ultimately very touching. Nice one, Bobcat."
0,"It's not like Amy was a serial canine abuser, for crying out loud. Had she been, the movie would be much more disgusting but also a lot more interesting and potentially more funny."
1,"Improbably, the movie manages to regroup after its outrageous opening and turn into an unpredictable, almost sweet, romantic comedy about the limits of candour."
1,Plays into an almost primal fear that there's something so awful in your past that if you spill the beans the other person will split -- no matter how much he or she professes that nothing you could say would ever have that effect.
1,"An evenly paced, gently acted and subdued black comedy with a subversive moral at its heart."
1,Hamilton is wonderful as the bruised victim of an oedipal insanity for truth.
1,"Despite being thin on laughs and light on conventional romance, Sleeping Dogs manages to be both warm and witty."
0,The movie provides a good time but isn't wholly satisfying in the end.
1,"Blurs the line between risque and raunchy, often to hilarious effect."
0,A farce executed by characters who feel more like pawns than fully realized people.
0,"This is a mindless comedy about sex that is never remotely funny, with a cast that is never remotely sexy, and which, in one case, is downright revolting."
1,"A silly, amusing trifle."
1,"A feel good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm."
0,"Billy Kent's comedy makes much of masturbation and sexual aids, and, in that spirit, takes great pleasure from its broad, flat self."
0,"Eventually, the oh's becomes 'zzzzzz's.'"
0,"Ohio, and Cleveland in particular, deserve much better than this."
0,People who complain about the lack of good adult comedies will still be complaining after watching Billy's Kent's The Oh in Ohio.
0,"Despite this seemingly surefire premise and cast of veteran comedians - there's even a cameo by Liza Minnelli as a masturbation coach -- The OH in Ohio just lies there, without a single laugh."
0,"Sometimes a flop is simply a case of a movie taking a wrong step. In the case of The OH in Ohio, it's a case of never taking a right one."
1,"Satire is awfully hard to pull off, but screenwriter Adam Wierzbianski exhibits a flair for it."
0,The Oh in Ohio deserves a dubious distinction award: for turning a woman's quest to achieve her first orgasm into a lackluster comedy.
0,"Unfortunately, writer Adam Wierzbianski, who seems more steeped in the rhythm method of sitcom than the less predictable peaks of screwball, allows the batteries to run down prematurely."
1,"It's a thrill to watch Posey incorporate, at last, some true emotion into her exuberant screwball wit."
0,A C- sex comedy with a near A-list cast -- at least in terms of talent -- The Oh in Ohio is one of those movies that promises much but doesn't deliver.
0,"At the end of the day, Kent and screenwriter Adam Wierzbianski have given us a mildly amusing premise, but fail to turn it into a story that takes us anywhere pleasurable."
0,"Sex comedies often glean laughs out of sexual humiliation, but when the laughs don't come -- and The Oh In Ohio is devoid of even the mildest chuckles -- all that's left is the humiliation."
0,The Oh in Ohio would make a second-rate lover: You'll lose interest a while before it reaches its climax.
0,This is the slightest and slimmest of sex comedies.
0,"The script, which was co-written by director Billy Kent, has the forced 'raciness' of a mid-'70s dinner-theater sex comedy."
0,Posey's such a delight it's easy to appreciate her even in a film as fruitless as The Oh in Ohio.
0,I felt some of its heroine's pain. She's spent her life waiting for an orgasm. I spent the movie waiting for a plot.
0,"A vibrator may put the buzz back in the solo sex life, but it tends to suck the life out of any movie not rated with three Xs."
1,"Comedies for grown-ups, period, are now in such short supply that a good-natured little picture like The Oh in Ohio feels like an anomaly."
1,"The elements of this Native American comedy look cloying on paper, but first-time helmer-scripter Kate Montgomery has such a winning way with her adroitly assembled cast that these concerns don't apply."
1,A sweet-natured holiday comedy that derives no small amount of specialness and energy from the fact that the movie offers a glimpse of contemporary American Indian life.
1,"This is an emphatically old-fashioned and family-friendly comedy with an American Indian setting and cast. A spin on some very familiar material, it's aimed at those who like their movies on the warm side."
1,"It's genuinely funny and it has heart without the obvious calculation the word ""heart"" usually means in a Hollywood film."
1,There will be holiday pictures that are more high-tech than this one. But there may not be many with such good cheer.
1,"A holiday charmer involving mistaken identity, Native American enterprise, and critter-free gourmet cookery."
1,"Looking for a heartwarming, grown-up movie to get you in the holiday spirit? Christmas in the Clouds should fit the bill."
0,"With its schmaltzy romance, slapdash mistaken identity and heartwarming finale, Christmas in the Clouds belongs on 'Lifetime.'"
1,"Although nearly every aspect of the plot is predictable, Christmas in the Clouds produces a delightful surprise: a warm glow that you take home with you."
1,"Not quite laugh-out-loud funny, but pleasant."
1,"A spin on familiar material, it's aimed at those who like their movies on the warm side."
0,"While Vahle and Tosca are the most attractive people onscreen, they are the least interesting characters."
1,"While you may have seen the story before, the offbeat characters and the movie location make you feel like you're treading new ground."
1,Kate Montgomery's agreeably schmaltzy rom-com tempers its near terminal folksiness with stereotype-tweaking irony.
1,"The path of true love may not be smooth but it is predictable in Christmas in the Clouds, a wisp of a movie set in a Utah ski resort run by a Native American tribe."
1,"A surprisingly layered vehicle for a maniacally conniving Richard Gere, backed up by a superb Alfred Molina as his accomplice."
1,"Jaunty, likable and surprisingly relevant tale of one of the better scandals of the '70s."
1,"Ultimately, The Hoax seems designed to appeal to the larcenous impulse in all of us."
1,"So sure is Hallstr철m's pacing that you barely notice the withering moral of the tale: when the money is big enough, everyone is a mug."
1,"It's bracing to see a grand con-man comedy like The Hoax, in which our moral universe is affirmed, and yet the fabled trickster Clifford Irving -- who wrote a fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes -- is so darn likable."
1,A provocative and blackly comic portrait of a con artist who is ultimately a pawn in a much larger and more intricate conspiracy than even he can fabricate.
0,"As a movie, The Hoax isn't a fraud but it's not the real deal, either."
1,"Richard Gere, nearly unrecognizable with blackened hair and a fake nose, gives one of his very best performances as Clifford Irving."
1,The film is a timely reminder that even the savviest and most skeptical audience can get snookered by the natural desire for a great story.
1,"Director Lasse Hallstr철m, delivering his best all-around work since 1999's The Cider House Rules, manages to sustain a nimble pace despite a crushing amount of narrative detail."
1,"An amusing bounce through an unhappy period in American history, recalling the attitudes, fashions, politics and paranoias of the day."
0,"We never establish an emotional connection with Irving. Even though we're caught up in his derring-do as he beguiles entire meeting rooms of jaded publishers and editors, we're kept at a dissatisfying distance from Irving and the movie."
1,"The filmmakers catch the right glittery look and paranoid intensity, and they make gutsy speculations about the story beneath the story."
1,"The Hoax never wanders too far from its pitiful but somehow joyously deceitful center, and Gere captures the sheer electricity of a man who, even for only a few moments, seems to have made reality play by his rules."
1,"Richard Gere is less charismatic than Irving and Alfred Molina turns Irving's assistant into a buffoon, but the secondary cast is fun to watch."
1,"Lasse Hallstr철m isn't the first filmmaker I'd think of to exhibit such adult zing, but this is the best thing the director has done since What's Eating Gilbert Grape."
1,"Gere, who is always sharpest when he's playing double-edged personalities, is fun to watch, and Hallstr철m conveys a bit of the circuslike atmosphere of the times."
1,"The literary and journalistic frauds of the present era are small potatoes compared to the work of Clifford Irving, the subject of The Hoax."
1,Gere seems as born again as he did during the musical numbers in Chicago.
0,Consider it the ultimate bit of bad luck -- or an apt irony --that Gere's comeback is stolen by the consistently excellent Alfred Molina.
1,"Desperate times call for desperate measures, and Hallstr철m and Wheeler have a great time setting up and embroidering Irving's increasingly elaborate scheme."
1,Richard Gere is the ideal actor for the role.
0,Even Machiavelli would have raised an eyebrow at some of the double-crossings and dealings in The Hoax.
1,"The Hoax doesn't tell its stories as well as Irving does, but it's an enjoyable immersion into a master storyteller's frantically made-up world."
1,"It's an accomplished potboiler entertainment, as calculated and clever as the stories Irving spins to stay afloat in the growing sea of his own lies."
1,At least half of The Hoax is a giddy pleasure.
1,It's a terrific film.
1,A gripping little film that is well told and well performed.
1,"Hallstr철m stops well short of cheesy, however, and he never veers from the movie's central fascination: the author's obsessive melding with his subject."
1,Gere persuasively portrays a guy whose confidence blossoms as he makes the discovery that as his lies grow so does the ease with which he tells them.
1,... a serious and amusing black farce that does without obvious heroes or villains ...
1,A tremendous shaggy dog story that bounds capably between comedy and tragedy.
1,Looks good without ever really catching fire.
1,An amusingly tense saga of literary con-artistry.
1,"An elegant, entertaining parable of the emperor's new clothes."
0,"Like Irving's book, it doesn't hold up."
1,Meticulously evoked atmosphere adds to the experience.
0,A two-dimensional landscape.
1,"Ultimately, these smart, zeitgeisty riffs are just as implausible as the idea of an authorised Howard Hughes autobiography."
1,"I've never been a fan of Richard Gere, but he gives the performance of his career as Clifford Irving."
1,Highly entertaining.
0,It's hard to get a fix on what Hallstrom had in mind.
1,[It] works chiefly because they continue to simultaneously embrace and condemn the cruel superficiality of their self-absorbed losers.
1,Guest's track record is hilariously intact with this buzz-worthy send-up of awards-season histrionics.
1,Crisply made and highly entertaining.
0,"Although it scores some easy laughs, Guest's latest is a disappointment."
1,"Guest and Levy stick it good to the dark heart of showbiz, daring to suggest that the Oscar fever on which Hollywood thrives is a sickness of the soul."
1,"Jane Lynch does a stance, a television hostess stance that's so perfect, without saying a word, that's funnier than almost anything I've seen in most mainstream comedies this year."
1,Even more welcome than a new Bond is a new Guest.
1,"The gags may be hit and miss in For Your Consideration, but the performances often are comic gems. This gang has worked together so often that they blend together effortlessly."
1,"Hoopla in Hollywood isn't the real subject here, merely the pretext for another oddball ode to lovable losers."
1,"Truly, the level of tender, ruthless, inspired, lethally accurate study that has gone into the follicular expression of each and every character in Christopher Guest's latest hilarious cultural corrective is something inspiring to behold."
0,The theory of comedy that applies here is that even the most talented people in the world cannot turn back the clock on an outdated concept.
0,"For Your Consideration is the first of Guest's films to be filmed as a narrative rather than a mock-documentary, but somehow it still feels a little played out and in need of a rest."
0,"Hollywood is rife for satire, but it's been done before."
0,By now Christopher Guest's brand of satire has become so formulaic that it hardly matters that he disposes with the pseudodocumentary format this time.
1,"For Your Consideration will not go down as one of Guest's crown jewels, but it's nevertheless engaging."
0,"For Your Consideration is by far the broadest comedy Christoper Guest and company have made. Despite its merriment, it is also the flimsiest."
0,For Your Consideration rests on the flimsiest of jests.
1,"[The film] may contain as many riffs on ego, self-deception and corporate greed as Guest's directorial debut, but it also possesses something rarely seen from the director: a shocking degree of unforgiving misanthropy."
1,"Marilyn may not rate an Oscar nomination, but O'Hara certainly does."
1,"Enough happens in show business margins of the Hollywood milieu depicted in For Your Consideration, in which Coolidge shows up as a bubbleheaded producer, to make up for a somewhat soft center."
0,"Much of the movie just counts on its audience saying, 'I don't know what kugel is, but that sure is a funny word.'"
0,"While that title raises expectations for delicious humor, what we see of the movie itself is foolish and flat."
1,... a winningly successful movie about abject failure.
0,"Much of For Your Consideration feels shrill and off-base, like it's working too hard and reaching too far."
1,... a quiet but often giggly pleasure.
1,For Your Consideration becomes more effective as it gets more cutting.
0,"You would expect heady fun from Guest and company as they parody themselves, but the movie is considerably weaker than past efforts."
1,... Christopher Guest's aim in For Your Consideration is hilariously accurate.
0,The target is way too easy and the tone far too smug.
1,"Despite the dead fish floating in this latest barrel, the potshots in For Your Consideration do add up to a knowing jeremiad against the maddening phenomenon of awards-season hype."
0,"For Your Consideration is aimed straight at the heart of the Hollywood beast. Unfortunately, Guest's aim isn't what it used to be."
1,"Like Guest's other films, For Your Consideration is extremely funny and tinged with sadness and disappointment, the kind that accompanies all of our inevitable adjustments to dreams deferred and downsized."
1,"You have to admire the economy of Guest's work, his ability to work on a small scale and his deadpan skill at keeping his actors on the emotional reservation -- calmly facing down emotional chaos."
0,"Individual scenes come across as amusing, but Guest loses comic momentum when he shifts between the shooting of the lachrymose Home for Purim and the segments lampooning entertainment media."
0,Fans of Guest's brand of repertory-company character comedies will find a few reasons to grin. But even the fanatical will have to admit that this one is hardly worth considering.
0,For Your Consideration always seems a bit too tame for its own good: It never busts out the way you hope it would.
1,"[Director Christoper Guest] finds the absurd (and shares in the discovery with his cast) but always sees some human, tender truth behind the laugh lines. As a result, For Your Consideration is certainly worth your consideration."
1,"Much of the funniest material is mined from the attendant media hoopla drummed up by the vacuous hosts of an ""Entertainment Tonight""-style show hosted by predictably hilarious Fred Willard and Jane Lynch."
1,The real joy lies in watching some of the funniest actors on the planet nail their characters with penetrating wit and pitiless insight.
1,"Inside the awfully good comedy For Your Consideration is a purely awful drama, dying to break out."
1,"Guest and his co-writer, Eugene Levy, aren't afraid to chew off the hand that feeds them."
1,"For Your Consideration won't win an Oscar, but it probably will win some adulation from hard-core Guest fans."
0,"In order to stay ahead as a mocker these days, you must nail your subject for good."
0,
1,"True, Hollywood's not difficult to caricature, but For Your Consideration is more than willing to savage the hand that feeds it."
1,May be a small jewel but it is certainly better value than half the biggies around just now.
0,"The best jokes are the true jokes, and truth has not been best served here."
0,"Guest goes for big, crude laughs every step of the way, and only a few of them come off."
1,"The comedy is very unsubtle, and huge swathes of screen-time are given over to Fred Willard as a presenter on a dumb entertainment TV show - funny, yes, but not funny enough to justify the vast amount of time he is given."
1,"In the most bittersweet of ironies, O'Hara was tipped by some as a potential Oscar nominee for her performance in the film. You suspect that she handled the whole demeaning circus with rather more dignity than her character does."
0,"The point is that Hollywood types are--gasp!--shallow. If that news shocks anyone, check your pulse, because you may have been in a coma for 80 years."
1,[The] set-up is given a human face by fine performances and a physical journey that's often more interesting than the characters' emotional ones.
0,"Visually, Free Zone resembles a home movie in which an overly enthusiastic vacationer records every moment of a mundane trip."
0,"Per usual, Gitai largely eschews exposition, but his reticence sits awkwardly beside his penchant for saddling his deliberately stereotyped figures with trite, unwieldy speeches and symbolic-ironic biographical data."
0,"Amos Gitai's long-winded essay revolves around the interaction of three women, an American, an Israeli and a Palestinian, on a car trip from Israel to Jordan."
0,Gita has no real interest in who these women are beyond their symbolic resonance.
0,"Free Zone suffers from too-much-information syndrome, stalling out now and again from its tangled narrative wiring and an overload of emotional freight."
0,"It's a nice crying jag by Natalie Portman, but there's not much else here to recommend."
0,The film is diluted by the use of flashbacks superimposed over present-time scenes. The result is visual chaos.
1,[A] fractious film from thorny filmmaker Amos Gitai.
0,"The message is made clear within the first 10 minutes, leaving us with about 80 minutes of thematic repetition."
0,"Without fail, Gitai's determination to churn everything into metaphoric mud prevails."
0,"Too slight as a metaphor for the larger catastrophe of the Mideast, too preachy to work as an emotionally compelling drama."
0,"Much of the dialogue is didactic and pedantic. And when not didactic and pedantic, it's plodding and dull."
0,"The movie -- a metaphor for the tangled, impossible state of Israeli/Palestinian relations -- only intermittently clicks."
0,"A minor movie on a major subject, a drama with an almost unbearable lightness."
0,A rambling road movie with noble intentions and an excess of speechifying.
0,"Surfing the crowd in Altman-lite style, pic skims the surface entertainingly but goes limp in its stabs at seriousness."
0,"Don't send a gift. Send your regrets. This is one wedding invitation that can clearly, safely be declined."
0,"The aptly named Standing Still, about postcollegiate 20-somethings, has the dramatic momentum of a daisy-picking toddler."
0,Relentlessly shallow.
0,A movie as inert as its title.
0,"Standing Still wants to be an honest, earnest look at the difficulties of growing up and moving on, but it remains stuck in such a fantasy-laden milieu that the characters never feel particularly real, and their problems seem phony and arbitrary."
0,"Despite the best efforts of its energetic young ensemble, this soft focus romantic comedy cries out for a sharper edge."
1,This is a hit and miss romantic comedy with a few solid laughs and some pretty smart dialogue.
1,The Swiss-quartz comic timing of the film's ensemble cast makes its neurotic characters more compelling than your average cinematic slackers.
0,The film's weakest moments are also its timeliest.
0,"It's a movie for the inner 9 year old in us all. That's the age that most people move on from flatulence jokes, and sniggering whenever they hear the 's' or 'f' words."
0,"To call Superhero Movie a satire, or even a parody, of the genre specified in its title would be misleading, since those terms imply at least an attempt at wit. But no real mockery is intended by this mindless grab bag of slightly used gags."
0,By-the-numbers screen parody fails to resurrect an increasingly tired genre.
0,The gags are consistently weak.
0,"Superhero Movie would make a decent long-form short on the ""Funny or Die"" website, but at 85 minutes -- 15 of which are outtake-heavy end credits -- its powers of amiability wear off fast."
0,"70 minutes of good if unmemorable fun sure beats 80 or 90 minutes of excruciating parodies for dummies, a la Date Movie and Epic Movie."
0,"It's rather benign, actually -- never very funny, and never amusing for more than a few moments at a time, but not grating or clownish, either."
1,"With jokes packed as tightly together as sliced cheese, the flick's comedy axiom seems to be: Never give the audience a pause to second-guess their laughter"
0,"It's a bit late in the game for Superhero Movie, which was never going to fly, and barely crawls."
0,"It looks for all the world as if writer/director Craig Mazin took the screenplay for Spider-Man, propped it up next to his MacBook, and just went through it, inserting fart gags, pratfalls and the lamest of jokes."
0,"The very act of writing critically about Superhero inspires something of an existential crisis -- no one likely to turn out for it is reading this review, and anybody reading this review is probably not inclined to see it under any circumstances."
0,"Puerile and idiotic it may be, but Superhero Movie is nonetheless smarter than most of its lowbrow brethren in the Hollywood sub-sub-category known as the spoof movie."
0,"There are a few lively bits, and one joke with an edge: a slap at Stephen Hawking and his computer-drone voice. Mostly, though, this is super-lame."
1,
1,"Pete McCormack's script only occasionally yields to melodrama. Mostly it allows the characters to breathe freely, expressing a greater range of human emotion than just love and sympathy."
0,Feels as forced and sentimental as one of those disease-of-the-week melodramas that were once the mainstay of U.S. television.
0,"The patronizing, gratuitous sentimentality undermines what could and should have been a simple story of courage and beauty."
1,"It is a marvelously promising first film, and Australia continues to amaze us with its steady procession of deliciously appealing young actresses. What is going on in that outback anyhow?"
1,"An unassuming, unadventurous, but likable dramedy about dying and grief."
1,"Forging her own new path, animator Sarah Watt makes a delicate, empathetic live-action directorial feature debut."
0,Sarah Watt's film follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history.
1,The best parts of the movie are its occasional animated sequences.
1,The much-honored Australian dramedy Look Both Ways may be the type of film that provides a purifying rain just when its beleaguered characters need it.
1,It's not a perfect movie. But it's definitely not a filmed play.
0,"Look Both Ways works its way to an improbably cheerful ending, but getting there is a slow trip."
1,A pleasantly peculiar ensemble movie about melancholic people coping with random tragedy.
0,"After the first hour, it's clear the movie isn't going to offer any surprising new insights into messed-up modernity."
1,... a surprisingly (and inexplicably) uplifting meditation on the myriad ways life makes us all acutely miserable.
1,"... a fearless movie about a fearful subject, an unusually empathetic and quite funny film that deals with death and dying in the most offbeat and casually life-affirming way."
1,"I watched the movie in a kind of fascination. It is poetic and unforgiving, romantic and stark."
1,"An imaginative, humorous and truthful contemplation of human reaction to the inexplicable."
1,"Watt's characters ... laugh at themselves and their dark obsessions, and there's something optimistic in the filmmaker's clear-eyed, straightforward storytelling style."
1,"Though Watt's emphasis on coincidence and fate seems strained at times, Look Both Ways is rich in dreamy summer atmosphere and deadpan wit."
1,... deliriously inventive ...
1,The film itself is beautifully done.
0,The bottom line is that none of this goes anywhere beyond a droning funeral procession.
1,How each person copes with trauma and renewal adds up to a tender tale rich in memorable performances.
1,
0,"Filled with aloof and confused characters just treading water, and even if they are likable, it eventually becomes tiresome. It's like one big pity party."
1,"A black-humored screenplay, realistic performances, eye-catching artwork, and a few creative turns on some well-worn themes."
1,Lapses in judgement occasionally jar -- like the habit of playing middle of the road ballads over key scenes -- but the central romance is touching enough to lock us in while bringing out the moral of this story.
0,"While [director Sarah] Watt begins to offer an interesting study in paranoia, tinged with some good comic moments, her multi-stranded plot and last-minute recourse to romance ultimately lost the interest of this viewer."
0,Never completely finds its balance.
0,"Snowed under by misjudgment on every level, The Big White is DOA."
1,"Whether or not Bobby Kennedy was the man his supporters believed him to be, the film makes a persuasive case that something important in America was silenced when he was gunned down."
1,"A passionate outcry for peace and justice in America that becomes deeply involving by the final climactic scene, overlaid with one of RFK's most stirring speeches."
0,"[Estevez's] attempt to shoehorn what he sees as the grand themes of the period into a choppy, unsubtle and insubstantial script is embarrassing."
0,"Estevez means to eulogize the hopes of a nation, showing the night's impact on a group of hotel guests and staff cross-sectioned by age, race, and class. But his movie ends up buried under its stifling good intentions and dire execution."
0,"In the movie business, there's no such thing as 'truth in titling.' If there was, Bobby would be called A Bunch of Boring, No-Name, Cookie-Cutter Characters."
0,"Bobby coasts along on a dread, and sorrow, it doesn't earn."
1,"Every frame is informed and fueled by Mr. Estevez's impassioned mourning for a figure who came close to changing the course of American history. Bobby is exciting, involving and riveting."
0,An exercise in historical revisionism for folks who would rather be informed of breaking national crises through news feeds on All My Children.
0,"It's an ambitious film drenched in sincerity and oozing with nostalgia that, despite the energy provided by its title icon via archival footage, falls flat dramatically in nearly every other way."
0,"Estevez probably could have cut the cast in half and come up with a richer, stronger film."
1,Everyone in this film is powerful.
1,"With Bobby, Emilo Estevez tries to link the intimate stories of nearly two dozen characters to a large and consequential public event the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy."
0,Estevez means well. But having your heart in the right place is no excuse for insipid ineptitude.
0,[Bobby's] a sketchbook trying to pass as a tapestry.
0,Emilio Estevez's Bobby tests your patience to the breaking point -- maybe beyond.
1,"The archival Kennedy clips aside, the excited radiance of these young characters' faces (and many of them are just extras) may be the best thing about Bobby."
1,"Despite its flaws, its intriguing premise leaves us haunted by thoughts of 'What if?'"
0,"It is a cross-section of America, and of the Screen Actor's Guild."
0,"Bobby, which reportedly is going to receive a huge push for the Oscars, is one of the year's worst movies."
1,"For all its flaws, Bobby is a heartfelt and undeniably relevant project."
1,"Despite the clunkiness, Estevez's commitment to his father's generation's idealism (and its murder) commands respect."
0,"Estevez has made a vague gesture at a large, metaphoric structure without having the dramatic means to achieve it."
1,"Bobby does do a solid job of telling one generation what the world was like in the summer of 1968, and reminding another generation of a time when they believed a politician could change the world."
0,"All the actors get their Big Moments, but verisimilitude goes out the window."
1,"There are important movies and engrossing movies, but it's not often that both terms apply to the same movie. Bobby, which opens Thursday, is a fictionalized account of the day Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, and it's one of the exceptions."
0,An earnest and altogether silly piece of conjectural melodrama.
0,The most interesting person in this maze of a movie is by far the title character. And his absence leaves an inescapable void.
1,"If Bobby causes us to stop and compare what might have been to the leadership we currently have, one suspects Estevez would not mind at all."
1,"A daring, messy and strangely rewarding patchwork that's straining at the seams."
1,"Ambitious, uneven and deeply affecting drama."
1,"With one film, Estevez has transformed himself from a middle-aged joke into a youthful auteur who has made something beautiful, something he can be proud of, one of the best films of 2006."
0,"With so much brandishing of name actors in small roles, Bobby feels like a '70s disaster flick, with the disaster in the final minutes. While waiting, viewers must content themselves with playing spot-the-star."
1,"Always engaging, rarely revelatory, Bobby earns credit for its convictions and its ability to dramatize those convictions in the context of a man who embodied them."
0,What little plot Bobby has is overshadowed by the star spotting.
1,"It's this disconnect between historical reality and dramatic indulgence that keeps an otherwise worthy film from being completely satisfying. There are moments, though, where even the most hardened cynic may have to wipe away tears of regret and loss."
1,"Ultimately rises above its inadequacies; it's an earnest tribute to a time gone by, and to a symbol of hope."
0,"It's a tin-eared movie, in many regards, history rewritten by that C-student who tries to jam too many footnotes into every character."
0,"A lot of quick, character-defining cameos, which makes the movie play out like a pilot for a sprawling prime-time television show."
0,It's little more than a collection of half-glimpsed lives.
1,A compelling film of tender moral decency that boasts a number of moments not to be shrugged off.
1,"So keenly felt and so deeply imagined I couldn't help but be moved, even grateful for its bleeding-heart nostalgia -- which winds up feeling rather up-to-date."
0,"Ham-handed and TV-movie flat, it states the obvious, then states it again and again and again."
0,"For all his good intentions, Mr. Estevez has reduced history to a bad melodrama in which nothing much happens until a crazed assassin (of whom we catch only a fleeting prior glimpse) supposedly destroys the last great hope of a liberal renaissance."
1,"Using his haunting elegy for Martin Luther King over the final scene, Estevez makes most of what's gone before seem entertaining enough but fairly trivial. This is not, after all, Grand Hotel."
0,"You can understand why somebody would want to make a film about such a famous ""lost moment"" in American history, but this celebrity ensemble piece is misconceived and poorly managed."
0,"Few of the characterisations could fill the back of a matchbook, and, in refusing to see RFK as anything other than a liberal messiah, the film meanders through its political context with a white stick and a dopey smile."
0,"Liberal Hollywood may well be looking for a uniting, inspiring figure of principle in these troubled times. Bobby Kennedy is a dull choice."
1,"The profound grip of Bobby is that it's about the murder of a dream, an eloquent requiem for what might have been, and a tragic reminder of how much that bullet cost."
1,"Presents a blinkered look at the man and what he meant to Americans in the turbulent 60s, but nobody can accuse Estevez of lacking sincerity."
0,
1,Guerilla filmmaking at its finest.
1,"For a guerrilla-style, no-budget Yank indie to even tackle issues of jihad terror and naive Western thinking is noteworthy in itself, but Gamazon and Dela Llana inflame the issues with a gutsy, athletic filmmaking package."
1,"A paragon of guerrilla resourcefulness and a model citizen of the global village, Cavite is a more anxious and vivid experience than most movies with budgets literally a thousand times bigger."
1,"Cavite was shot on a microbudget, and that turns out to be a +. After so many overproduced blockbusters this season, it's nice to see a movie that's lean and mean."
1,"Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in Cavite, a gripping no-budget political thriller."
0,"It might have worked if co-director/star Gamazon had taken an acting class, or if the kidnapper didn't sound like a villainous GPS navigating device."
1,"Enhanced by the you-are-there immediacy of a hand-held digital camera, Cavite works up a visceral potency that overleaps the credibility gaps in the omniscient-terrorist device."
0,A last act full of reversals would have filled in the holes in Cavite.
0,"The hand-held camera work gives the film an effective documentary pulse, but it adds up to only half a movie."
0,A microbudget exercise in sensory overload that leaves you sick on all sorts of levels.
1,"One of those blistering no-budget thrillers, like Open Water or Detour, in which the film's economy of means is the trigger for its ingenuity."
1,"Though the film seldom deviates from its thriller format, Gamazon and Dela Llana astutely weave in matters of political, cultural and religious importance, elevating Cavite well above mere genre."
1,This is by no means a polished film. But it has an energy lacking in thrillers that cost hundreds times more to make.
1,"Cavite will go down in history as a classic of no-budget filmmaking, making such ingenious use of bare resources that it's a wonder the movie is an effective, even thoughtful thriller."
0,"Its herky-jerky camcorder style, jump-cut editing and sustained takes soon wear out their welcome."
0,"One of the more spectacular misfires of recent years, Land of the Blind's lack of originality is only slightly exceeded by its failure to work as political satire."
0,"The movie leaves you with lots of questions, mainly, what are Ralph Fiennes and Donald Sutherland doing here? Imagine Ed Wood attempting Brazil or Uwe Boll remaking V For Vendetta."
0,Political satire is so rare that it's a shame to watch the reliable Ralph Fiennes and Donald Sutherland lend their talents to one that is blind to its own incompetence.
0,Wrongheaded and bizarrely outrageous.
0,"If satire is the thing that closes on Saturday night, then political satire is usually doomed to close one night earlier. In the case of a pretentious monstrosity called Land of the Blind, it's a miracle it ever opened at all."
0,There's nothing particularly revolutionary about writer-director Robert Edwards' grimly satiric political fable.
0,"Robert Edward's satirical allegory shamelessly borrows ideas from Orwell's 1984, then tramples them into the dust."
0,"Writer-director Robert Edwards frantically throws in references to Orwell (Animal Farm and 1984), Lady Macbeth, Yeats, Mao, etc."
1,An indelible portrait of the contradictions of power.
0,About as subtle as its all too obvious title would suggest.
0,The only matter that interests is the question of Fiennes's presence in this political lesson for children.
0,"Sometimes it's best to leave those old scripts in the trunk, a view borne out by Coastlines,a melodramatic step backward for writer-director Victor Nunez after his last two pictures."
0,"Enough of the ingredients for a sultry downscale noir are in place in Coastlines, that once the film turns perversely goody-good, it leaves you feeling vaguely disgruntled."
0,"Nuez's idea of the characters' ordinariness translates to flavorlessness, and he lights and shoots his scenes with a high schooler's care, often not even bothering to match up sight lines."
1,"Nunez's multidimensional character development, with fine performances by Olyphant, Brolin, Wynter and Angela Bettis as one of Sonny's old flames, lends weight to the schematic plot points."
0,[The love triangle] plays more like canned heat than blazing inferno...
1,"It's a heartfelt movie that could have used a zigzaggier undercurrent, though Olyphant, in the sort of role that Paul Newman used to swagger through, has a star's easy command."
0,"As they say, two out of three ain't bad, and we look forward to more winners by Nunez."
0,Nunez's fans will appreciate his ability to evoke a palpable atmosphere. But there's just not enough spark in his scorched setting.
0,"The stuff of pulp, seriously at odds with what the writer-director has always done best. That is, show the inner workings of people, their needs, their fears, their small dreams."
0,A skeeter noir bogged down in the unconvincing pulp of a melodrama without conviction.
1,"Proves that while Ulee's Gold was an exceptional movie, it wasn't a fluke. Nuez just needs to search past the Panhandle for fresh material."
1,"Keeps you entertained throughout its two hours, which says a lot about Nunez's storytelling."
0,The third entry lacks the subtle power of the previous two efforts.
1,"The talent is still there, the film better than most. It just needs less crime, more love."
1,It's flawed but no less fascinating for its mood of simmering tension on the fringes of the American dream.
1,"A distinctive, sharp-witted and good-looking period comedy."
1,Unconscious is relentlessly wacky but robustly performed...
1,We should be thankful for the wit and style of Joaqun Oristrell's film.
1,"A well-observed, sideways portrait of the day, Unconscious is a little gem."
0,"[Director Joaquin] Oristrell's comedic sense only seems to succeed in spurts, and he often burdens the proceedings with a theatrical and contrived air that undermines the humor."
1,"The movie's message is clear: Freud's greatest contribution to society was not the idea that all little boys long to sleep with their mothers -- rather, it's the concept of the unconscious, a hidden place where our secret desires yearn to be free."
1,"Are the Spanish the only ones these days able to make movie comedies that are smart, sexy, wacky and graceful all at once?"
0,"The comedy is too broad, lacking the subtlety that the film's high-brow intentions require."
1,The Freudian farce Unconscious is paced so breathlessly that it keeps you panting to keep up with each new plot twist.
1,"The film is sustained effortlessly by the charismatic Watling and Tosar, who are among Spain's most popular movie stars."
0,"You've probably been to parties like this, even if you wish you hadn't: languid all-nighters filled with vaguely recognizable music and vaguely employed artists."
0,"There's nothing especially new or interesting about the guests, the party or the movie."
0,"By the final fade-out, there have been only two or three resolutions, positive or negative, to the erotic and emotional alliances made during the party itself; the rest is mere flirting and self-promotion."
0,It's all terribly self-referential.
0,"Don't go down to the basement, you idiot, there's a slavering hound waiting to attack you."
0,Dogs swimming aren't scary.
0,"Despite the presence of Wes Craven as a producer, this is really a pretty unscary effort."
0,The Breed is all bite.
0,"The script is at times, laughable, and generally it's the four-legged actors putting in the best performances."
0,"A mongrel killer-dog movie that takes us back to ~Cujo(TM) territory, where Man(TM)s Best Friend turns into his most ferocious enemy."
1,"A movie that's clever, hilarious and -- in its own stylish way -- ironic."
0,"A more deadpan, mock-solemn approach might have lent this concept a veneer of genuine wit. But Neremberg's jokey pastiche plays out in exactly the short-attention-span mode he decries in modern media."
0,Any film that credits itself as 'filmed and directed by the people of Iraq' deserves to be regarded with skepticism.
1,"By turns heartbreaking, amusing and disturbing, the film features people from different regions, economic classes and religions, recounting stories that are sometimes bleak, sometimes encouraging, but always compelling."
1,"If Voices of Iraq cannot claim to represent the political 'truth' about the war, it certainly provides an unprecedented glimpse into the texture of daily life there."
1,"An extraordinary, up-to-the-minute tapestry that ranges all over this country of 25 million people and carries the force of revelation."
1,A thought-provoking way to tell part of the present-day story of this war-torn country.
0,"As a true or accurate portrait of the real Iraq ... pic pales in comparison to various in-depth U.S. and European reports, and to Bahman Ghobadi's brilliant new drama on wartime Kurdish refugees, Turtles Can Fly."
1,"We don't get to stay with anyone long enough to feel the full power of their story, but a mosaic portrait of a diverse nation emerges."
0,"Despite a good amount of balance allowing for the expression of some anti-American sentiment, Voices of Iraq comes down squarely on the side supporting the war in Iraq."
1,It's an approach that even the war's harshest critics should find interesting.
0,"It's impossible to say if what the makers of this 'experimental documentary' have assembled is a representative sample of these home movies, but on balance it's vastly more flattering to the Bush administration than Fahrenheit 9/11 and its ilk."
0,The lack of more than a handful of Iraqis decrying their personal losses and the chaos that has ensued makes it hard to trust the sincerity of the filmmakers.
0,Maybe my skepticism comes with the timing -- the movie arrives just days before the presidential election.
0,"Little more than a slipshod, trashy, sometimes exploitative thriller."
0,The film's horrific and important subject matter is distilled into a lackluster lump of generic buddy-movie/road-picture components.
1,Trade is as gripping as it is important.
1,"As a movie, Trade is so-so, but as an expos챕 of how the new globalized industry of sex trafficking really works, it's a disquieting, eye-opening bulletin."
0,"It gets high marks for its lofty intentions, but it is only mediocre as a thriller and is clunky in its presentation."
0,"Trade's fictional drama is [hard] to believe, and impossible to justify."
0,"By introducing silly elements into a serious endeavor, the filmmakers undercut their own movie. In the end, we're watching a somewhat exploitative movie about exploitation."
0,"Trade has telegraphed the most sordid examples of the international child sex trade into a small, somewhat exploitative thriller."
0,"Other than showing how a trafficking pipeline might work, Trade is a total misfire, a strange attempt at making a buddy movie featuring a morose Kevin Kline and a 17-year-old Mexican boy looking for his kidnapped sister."
0,"It labors under the delusion that it's this year's revelatory, eye-opening Maria Full Of Grace, when it's little more than a B-movie with an overwrought conscience."
0,A routine crime melodrama with art-house message-movie pretensions.
0,"The story of the victims on the road is harrowing, but the tale of the kind cop and the teenager with an attitude is a string of big brother clich챕s."
1,This mostly effective dramatization paints a suitably ugly picture of the dehumanizing depths people are willing to go for money.
0,"Trade takes on a serious, under-addressed international crime against humanity in a style that is somewhere between TV melodrama and drive-in exploitation, undoing its obvious good intentions and some truly provocative moments."
0,"A nasty, vile business, made more slimy because director Marco Kreuzpaintner doesn't trust the intrinsic interest of his story, and pumps it up with chase details, close calls, manufactured crises, and gratuitous scenes."
0,The movie often seems to be exploiting as much as illuminating the problem.
0,"Human trafficking is an awful societal issue, and Trade happens to be an awful movie about human trafficking."
0,A straightforward and uninspired look at the sex trade.
0,"Comes off like TV-movie sensationalism, sidetracked by distracting backstories and hard-to-swallow plot twists."
0,"Jose Rivera창(TM)s highly improbable and sensationalized screenplay leaves its actors no room for authenticity. Marco Kreuzpaintner directs with commendable energy, but squanders Daniel Gottschalk창(TM)s gold-dust-strewn images on hyperventilating voyeurism."
1,I was moved.
1,"Grim, hard to take, and nightmare-producing, Trade is not for the faint of heart."
0,"The filmmaker tries to keep the energy up and the audience engaged by incorporating stylistic touches from the Michael Bay 101 crib sheet, whirling the camera around characters in crisis and lacing scenes with hack guitar rock."
0,"A documentary about sex trafficking might have been more powerful. Dramatizing the subject in this fashion, with a race-against-time road trip, breathless online bidding and a couple of different happy endings, simply cheapens it."
0,
1,"As cinema, 'Trade' is flawed: the script is functional and the dry characters are hemmed in by the machinations of an unremarkable plot."
0,"This cockeyed odd-couple road movie is well-intentioned, but it comes perilously close to feeding off the crimes it condemns."
0,Is it possible to agree with what a film is saying while disliking the way it says it? Trade leaves no arm untwisted and no message unrammed.
0,"Jose Rivera's script plays uneasily, as do some of the directorial flourishes: the shots of rose stems and caged birds are galumphingly emphatic at moments that need no underlining."

1,"Not only are slasher/horror/splatter films enjoying a sharp spike in popularity, right now they're also where one can find the best comedy."
0,"You keep looking for a sign that its young writer-director, Ryan Schifrin, is going for a tongue-in-cheek romp. But no, he seems to be deadly earnest."
0,There's no salvaging this.
0,"Despite pic's earnestness and obvious good intentions, narrative elements, carefully set forth though they may be, fall back on overfamiliar, underdeveloped tropes."
1,"Without overdoing the quirk factor or the melodrama, Lee shows a sure feel for family dynamics, and her light touch brings out the best in the ensemble's lovely, understated performances."
1,"Red Doors is so well-meaning, with such obvious affection for its characters, that it pleases nonetheless."
1,"Well-shot, well-written film."
1,"This agreeable, lightweight movie, written and directed by Georgia Lee, turns the malaises of a suburban family into bittersweet farce that teeters between cheeky humor and surface pathos."
1,"A few of the plot threads are woven more neatly than others, but the film makes for a promising debut."
0,... the script falls victim to the stereotypes and cliches so often found in movies about Asian-American families.
0,Red Doors feels like a first-time film; quirks are overplayed while themes remain underdeveloped.
1,"Named for the traditional Chinese color of good luck, the gentle indie drama Red Doors is really more in the rosy pink range of the color palette than a more primary emotional hue."
1,"A gentle, pleasant film about people you genuinely like."
0,"Not surprisingly, the three Wong sisters and their father could exist in separate movies -- their (short) stories are interesting but not convincingly knit together. Think of Red Doors as a promise, and hope that [director] Georgia Lee keeps it."
0,"For all its quirky touches, the comedy cleaves to formula in its depiction of how they challenge and change each other."
0,Forget 30-minute delivery -- this brand of indie quirkiness congealed in the late '90s.
0,"Thin, flavorless and heavily garnished with contrivance, this odd couple comedy serves up little but stale whimsy."
1,"Among slacker comedies, Pizza is never much more than mildly amusing; it isn't as witty as Slacker or as uproarious as Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, but it's a keeper."
0,"At the end of her spontaneous date, she says it's been the best night of her life. It will not be one of yours."
1,"A bittersweet, persuasively acted comedy whose tone recalls '80s teen films."
1,"It's Sparks (television's Complete Savages) and Embry (Can't Hardly Wait) who carry this dual coming-of-age tale with engaging, if often raw, performances."
0,"The Magus is an esoteric, talky, slowly-developing, sensitively-executed, and somewhat dull film."
1,"It is surprising how the movie (which was shot, incidentally, in Majorca without the Greek crisis in mind) is not embarrassing, but actually dovetails with yachtings and oppressions in contemporary Greece."
1,Pic relies on chemistry that fairly crackles between the principals to successfully deliver its teen hero from familial repression and rescue its pubescent lead from child-star roles.
1,"It may not pass with flying colours, but Driving Lessons still motors along likeably enough."
1,"Familiar fare, it has to be said, but the component parts are done reasonably well."
0,"Aiming for wacky and heartwarming, the film is, at its sporadic best, a mildly diverting coming-of-age story. At its worst, it feels forced."
0,"Driving Lessons follows the well-worn path laid down by other, better movies while making strained, ludicrous things happen toward the end."
1,Driving Lessons belongs to that hardy niche of British comedies designed as star vehicles for distinguished actresses (preferably Dames) of a certain age whose assignment is to win awards by devouring the scenery.
1,"This coming-of-age movie, unlike Evie's sleek old Citroen wagon, is a clumsy contraption, but it's nice to see Rupert Grint coming out from under that colorful thatch, and coming, not a moment too soon, into an appealing pre-maturity."
0,"It's sad to see actors like Walters and Linney mired in such undignified, one-note roles. The movie is an object lesson in the lack of good parts around for actresses, even on the indie front. Class dismissed."
1,"The mild British wackiness is more droll than funny, but the movie is a pleasant cup of tea."
1,"Linney hits a single note for her uptight character, while Walters travels the scale indiscriminately. Her outsized eccentric darts from amusing to grating. Only Grint is just right, as the boy they, and the film, can't do without."
0,Linney is too sensitive and capable an actress to play a stock villain like this. That everyone in the movie dislikes her makes you dislike everyone in the movie.
0,"A Scottish Harold and Maude, with none of the charm."
1,"With the aid of a charmingly offbeat story and a jolly good dialect coach, the stars leave you thinking, well done. Their spirited performances help cover up glaring holes in the plot."
0,Everybody in the movie is so tightly wound that Walters seems a model of actorly limberness.
1,"This ensemble delivers, engaging in repartee like Roger Federer plays tennis."
1,"Despite its slight and vaguely silly premise, Driving Lessons turns out to be sweet, never cloying, and amusing in an understated British way."
1,"Driving Lessons doesn't represent a zenith in the subgenre, and it trades on some feeble character ploys, but it's a kick to watch Julie Walters do a barmy-charmer bit on Rupert Grint."
0,The movie's life-affirmative agenda is ploddingly clear.
0,"That's not exactly a novel premise, which may explain why this British coming-of-age story inspires too little excitement."
1,"Amiable performances and a gentle, generous chemistry between Walters and Grint make the ride pleasant."
1,Offers a pleasant excursion down a familiar road.
0,It's an exercise in calculated high-quirk in which the most egregious forms of stereotyping -- particularly along gender and religious lines -- attempt to pass for 'human' behaviour.
0,[Brock] sticks to the inspirational formula of contemporary English sentimental comedies: that real life has little relevance.
1,"Driving Lessons, with perfectly cast actors, a poignant and often hilarious script and original music, is a study in how fun British humor can be."
0,Barely worth the trip.
1,Driving Lessons is a poignant miniature that offers [Julie] Walters a chance to be typically wonderful - saucy but deep - and [Rupert] Grint to stretch quite commendably.
0,"Writer-director Jeremy Brock has backloaded much of the hero's family conflict into the final scenes, which collapse under the weight."
0,Brock subscribes to the new school of British Imperialism: crafting cozy little trifles that conquer foreigners with preciousness.
1,Enormously absorbing.
1,"Ballets Russes, a graceful and fascinating documentary, chronicles the world of dance following the 1929 death of the ballet impresario Serge Diaghilev."
1,Directors Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine have done a fine job of locating old footage of the companies -- much in color -- but an even better one of locating the company's old dancers.
1,"Seamless, effortlessly grandiose and thoroughly entertaining."
1,An affectionate look at the legendary dance comany.
0,Enacts its drama with a light editorial hand and unavoidable sentimentality.
1,"Blessed with a surfeit of archival footage and dozens of marvelous, first-person stories, filmmakers Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine have created a rich, complex portrait of the legendary Russian Ballet."
1,"Geller and Goldfine have assembled a vital historical document, covering a cultural era now mostly lost, corrupted imperceptibly but permanently when fledgling ballerinas started dreaming about Broadway and Hollywood instead of Swan Lake."
1,"The archival footage is so breathtaking, the reminiscences so piquant, that even a stranger to dance can't help but be swept up by this peek into such exquisite, now vanished glamour."
1,A captivating if somewhat conventional documentary.
1,A daisy chain of touching now-and-then moments.
1,The stories and people presented here are involving enough to enthrall anyone.
1,An electrifying documentary by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine that lovingly and authoritatively brings to life an era of unequaled artistic excitement.
1,"Ballets Russes may not be the greatest dance documentary ever made, but it could well be the most accessible and touching."
1,"Dance fans will be dazzled by its treasure trove of archival dance footage. But those who know little of ballet will find plenty here to feed the soul, in the film's rich portraits of men and women nearing the end of a life lived in the arts."
1,"Geller and Goldfine orchestrate a ballet movie that is every bit as entertaining, gossipy and relevant as it is historically accurate."
1,Vintage footage and modern interviews and staged 'events' tell the tale of this important piece of art history.
1,Ballets Russes does an amazing job of unearthing footage of the famous ballet troupe from its beginnings in turn-of-the-century Paris through to its demise in the '60s.
1,"Capturing glimpses of those halcyon days, filmmakers Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine offer the documentary Ballets Russes, riveting in rare footage and poignant interviews with some of the dancers who brought ballet to the hinterlands."
1,"Enchanting, edifying and exhilarating."
1,"... a heartening affirmation of the spirit that helped many dancers to thrive in their heyday more than half a century ago and to survive as teachers, dance devotees and priceless raconteurs."
1,"A casual interest in dance is all it takes to enjoy Ballets Russes, an enchanting new documentary about the famed French ballet company."
0,"Despite some neatly understated yet complex performances by Griffiths and newcomer Everett, the film has a tendency to meander from scene to scene without ever sufficiently engaging the viewer."
1,Immensely engrossing.
0,"You can call it guilty of exploitation, tastelessness or insensitivity if you like, but its greatest failing is a certain deadly pointlessness."
0,"No audience, Canadian or otherwise, will learn anything here outside of the macabre facts. Worse, they won't feel anything either, not even -- and this is inexcusable -- for the victims themselves."
0,"Things in the movie, like the slasher movie music cues, hint that Karla has exploitation in its veins. The reasons for making it -- and seeing it -- remain more than slightly suspect."
0,"While it would like to be nimble, light-footed satire, too often Death and Texas stumbles on its own earnestness, wearing cement shoes when it should be tap-dancing."
0,An uneasy (and very unfunny) marriage of sports culture satire and death penalty polemic.
1,[A] magnificent piece of agitprop.
1,"Pitch-perfect central perf (by scribe and co-producer Damian Lahey), total lack of dramatic artifice and surreally situational humor make for a minor-key vignette of unmistakable, if unstable, authenticity."
1,"We may learn nothing new about the grasp of addiction, but the movie's lean 75 minutes is at least a genuinely fast track to oblivion."
1,"Movies about addicts are a dime a dozen, but Cocaine Angel does its own thing, mixing humor with bleakness and resisting the too-common urge to romanticize addiction."
0,Plays like a very special episode of The OC.
0,The only horror here is the script.
0,"Makes good use of its Washington state backdrop, plays around with some actual allegories and is taken seriously by all involved. But with material this ephemerally transparent, that does neither the movie nor the people involved any favors."
0,This latest recycling of foreign-grown frights shows less interest in horror than in healing.
1,"[This] wasn't screened for the press, perhaps because its poetic fantasy premise is so hard to understand. Yet originality and even a certain amount of obscurity are more appealing than formula."
0,"Layers of the story are jammed into the script, but what might work as a narrative device in a novel -- the spirit guiding readers through Nick's revelations -- is just plain ridiculous in a movie."
0,The Invisible is little more than an extended excuse for a soundtrack.
0,"Even ghost stories aren't allowed to be so ludicrous as to show a gut-shot character carrying on as if suffering from nothing worse than a mild wedgie, or a guy trying to drag his own body to safety."
1,"A fully felt, decently crafted teen B-movie melodrama, plenty preposterous in places but alive to the vibrant miseries of being young and misunderstood."
0,"The drama never comes together in a smart, meaningful way; indeed, most revelations border on the banal."
0,"If anything, the movie is too introspective, to the point that it doesn't build enough conflict or tension."
0,"Director David S. Goyer doesn't get half the skin-crawling mileage out of the ghost factor that he could. As a result, The Invisible really isn't worth seeing."
0,They should have called this Perturbia.
0,My screening presented the final reel upside down and backward; no difference whatsoever.

1,"In his ghoulish documentary, director Eric Steel examines the Golden Gate's dubious honor as the world's most popular suicide destination."
1,"This is a shocking film, but in its own way a profoundly humane one."
1,"It de-romanticizes the idea of suicide by italicizing it in all its bleak, brutal reality, while making palpable the tortured predicament of those left behind."
0,"Despite the proficient technique, after a while you may feel you're watching a particularly scenic snuff film."
1,"The Bridge is both a beautiful film and a disturbing one, and the connection between those two characteristics makes it the most disquieting of documentaries."
1,This eerie and indelible documentary about suicide juxtaposes transcendent beauty with personal tragedy.
1,"You leave The Bridge with a new appreciation for your (relative) mental stability and a vow to make the most of your brief, ephemeral life."
1,"It's disturbing, needless to say, but also affecting in unexpected ways."
1,"The interviews with loved ones keep the tragedies in context and help us process what we see. The true substance of The Bridge lies in their words, rather than the shots of the people they've lost."
1,"The Bridge does not try to milk these tragedies, which are often shot from a great distance and tastefully edited."
0,"One of (author Neale Donald) Walsch's precepts is that you should never make a living doing something you hate. If I'd known that, I might not have felt obliged to sit through every excruciating minute of this sanctimonious infomercial."
1,"The Bridge is brave and unflinching, unshakably haunting and deeply mysterious. I doubt I'll forget it until the day I die."
1,It may be the first poetic snuff film.
1,"By his use of interviews of friends and family of jumpers, Steel reminds us that no matter how alone some of these people felt, they weren't without people who loved them. It is a tender, powerful work."
0,"Aspires to humanize the people who kill themselves at the Golden Gate Bridge, but ends up mostly reducing its subjects to their flamboyant and very public deaths."
1,The whole thing invokes the bodies falling from that other architectural icon on 9/11 - but it's not clear what is achieved beyond disturbance.
0,It's gripping viewing but you feel like a voyeur of somebody else's pain. After a while you may feel that you're watching a particularly scenic snuff film.
0,This could be the most morally loathsome film ever made.
1,"despite the shocking, up-close look, we're no closer to a real understanding of the terrible urge to end it all."
1,"The Bridge avoids reducing its subjects to types, and if the portraits painted are often recognizable -- the person who talks so much about suicide that those around him fail to take him seriously -- they are not repetitive."
1,"Tales are dramatic; the interviewees poignant, and the images -- often following bodies all the way down to the water -- are startling and discomfiting."
0,"It's an agreeable enough tale right up until God butts in and starts talking; even if you can swallow the premise, it isn't particularly cinematic to watch a guy endlessly scribbling on legal pads."
0,"It's inspiring to see how Walsch conquered the odds, but at times Conversations With God feels like a subliminal advertisement for the book."
0,"OK, Lord... For starters, since when do you talk like Dr. Phil?"
0,There's nothing particularly objectionable about the film (other than its inert movie-of-the-week structure) until Walsch takes his God-spokesman role too far in the final act.
0,"Writer Eric DelaBarre and director Stephen Simon deliver Walsch's apotheosis without any trace of irony. But their treatment of his misfortunes has some of the ring of truth, even though the movie lingers far too long over its own epiphanies."
0,The film treats its subject to a hagiography rather than a dramatization.
0,"Conversations with God is a bad film about good things that many people will find enlightening. Its message is admirable, its filmmaking as bland as a communion wafer."
0,"If God did start speaking to some random homeless guy, wouldn't he come up with some better material?"
0,The 'God' in Conversations with God acts like a psychotherapist and talks in the buzz-phrases of self-help speak.
0,"God, if you exist, why do you keep letting morons like Walsch get rich?"
0,"One of Walsch's precepts is that you should never make a living doing something you hate. If I'd known that, I might not have felt obliged to sit through every excruciating minute of this sanctimonious infomercial."
1,"Watching Czerny's version of Walsch struggle, it's hard not to connect with him, even if you don't connect with his message."
0,I don't doubt that Walsch's book has touched people. I don't even question whether he actually spoke to God. I just wish the movie itself shared some of his miraculous message with audiences.
0,"The movie claims the 'God inside me' concept is rooted in compassion, but it plays like nondenominational narcissism to me."
0,"Spirituality is big business, especially on the printed page, but in movies we like the Big Message in the form of metaphor or allegory rather than a hammer over the head."
0,"The story of Walsch's travails never strains credulity, though helmer Simon's predilection for spiritual vistas with light breaking through clouds, arrested close-ups and endless long dissolves often skirts kitsch."
0,"What He does want, according to Walsch, is for us to have jobs we really like, and to make money. Lots of money."
0,This film adaptation of Neale Donald Walsch's best-selling book series plays more like an infomercial than a thoughtful exploration of religious issues.
0,"A terminally muddled movie, uncertain as to whether it's promoting Neale, God, Mammon, Putnam Books or the capitalist exploitation of spiritual need."
0,"Although Stephen Simon's film has the mawkish trappings of an inspirational tale, its unseemly emphasis on monetary matters makes Walsch seem less interested in the spiritual possibilities of his celestial networking skills than their financial benefits."
0,"A coda after the closing credits, encouraging divine dialogues in general, does little to dispel the hagiographic aftertaste."
0,"What would happen if a late-night, D-grade direct-to-cable thriller excised all of the raunchily enjoyable elements and managed to attract an A-list cast? The result might be shockingly like Perfect Stranger."
0,"Perfect Stranger is spam -- not only commercially generated, but irritating in the faith that buyers will be as dumb about Internet-based thrillers as the sellers are. My advice is to delete without opening."
0,"There's a vast, possibly bottomless pit reserved for thrillers that are neither good nor bad enough to be truly entertaining, and James Foley's Perfect Stranger tumbles right into it."
0,"Life is full of choices, and Halle Berry has made another bad one with Perfect Stranger, a perfectly off-putting thriller."
0,A cheesy affair that casts so many baited lures that they tangle each other and don't hook you.
0,"It might be selling itself as a ""sexy thriller,"" but the cheesy, smirk-inducing reality is that Perfect Stranger would have been on the direct-to-DVD fast track had it not been for the names Halle Berry and Bruce Willis above the title."
0,"By the time everything falls into place, it doesn't much matter. The best thrillers don't just show up for the closing credits, they are involving all along the way. That's where Perfect Stranger goes imperfectly wrong."
0,"A great thriller should be the model of simplicity. Perfect Stranger, like so many other thrillers nowadays, is often complicated just for the sake of being complicated. This more-is-better approach isn't more, and it isn't better."
0,This stupidly contrived thriller is all the more disappointing if you admire previous work by Berry and director James Foley.
1,"Considering the twirliness of the story, this is a fairly straightforward film that knows where it's going and how to get there. And there's much to be admired in that."
0,"Pink is the new black, 50 is the new 30 and, at the movies, confusion is the new suspense."
0,"All the hip technology, including e-mail hacking, tiny portable USB devices and fake IM accounts, is supposed to make us feel disoriented by the modern lack of face-to-face communication, but it feels played out and overexplained."
0,"The murder clues are trotted out in dishonestly protracted fashion by screenwriter Todd Komarnicki, who plants red herrings as malodorous as a fish market at 5 in the morning."
0,"Despite the presence of the luminous Berry, Perfect Stranger is really just another thriller, utterly disposable, in town for a few desultory weeks until it heads off to a mild afterlife on DVD and then richly deserved oblivion."
0,Fairly diverting until it starts becoming ridiculous.
0,"Perfect Stranger is one of those movies in which nothing and no one turns out the way they originally seemed. And, maddeningly, that's true of the movie itself, as well."
0,Its shiny plastic glamour serves to endorse the very phoniness it ought to be warning us about.
0,"Reportedly, several endings were filmed; perhaps some of them make more sense than this one."
0,"People with access to vital information just show up when the movie needs them, then vanish again."
1,"For those who are interested in Berry as both an actress and screen presence, this is one of the most satisfying films she has ever made. It capitalizes on her strengths and she owns the picture, from start to finish."
0,"That's right, it's a techno thriller that treats the already clich챕d topic of Web abuse with an idiotic sense of discovery."
0,"Layered with improbable plot twists and hypocritical commentary, the movie is lurid and outdated when it wants to be hip and provocative."
0,"Nothing can quite top the climax, which arbitrarily assigns a culprit in a way that makes you question almost every single thing that's transpired up to that point. And no, that's not a good thing in this case."
0,"People peek through windows, hack into computers and sneak into apartments without the slightest hesitation. We're guilty of voyeurism, too, since the primary pleasure to be found is in seeing three confident leads play off each other."
0,"Perfect Stranger isn't great art by any stretch, or even art by any stretch, but it is perfectly functional low-to-middlebrow entertainment -- a B movie at ease inside its own gaudy skin."
0,One of those formulaic thrillers loaded with a whole lot more plot than common sense.
0,"Everyone behaves like characters who are motivated not by emotion or logic, but the to and fro of a remote control or joystick."
0,Perfect Stranger soon begins to look like another setback for Berry.
0,"Perfect Stranger, the new thriller starring Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, is far from perfect and, lame as it is, not quite lousy enough to pan with joy."
0,"Just when you thought The Reaping was the most convoluted and overwrought flashback-riddled thriller starring an Academy Award-winning actress in theaters, along comes Perfect Stranger."
0,A laughably overheated thriller from the once promising James Foley.
0,"Even after it lurches from the far-fetched into the preposterous, Perfect Stranger leaves a clammy residue of unease."
0,"Instead of eroticism, there is tacky sub-porn; instead of twists, there are knotty plot problems which may or may not have been fixable with script rewrites."
0,Some films are marred by absurd endings; this dire journo-thriller is like one big mar.
0,A tangled mess.
0,"There is entertainment to be had here, but it's mostly at the expense of the film's rambling, increasingly ridiculous plot."
0,"The movie would perhaps like to say something serious about the ease with which modern communications allows us to be multiple personalities, but that effort is lost in ineptitude."
0,A rarely suspenseful thriller with a twist ending of the worst kind: It takes too much explanation.
0,The movie shows that the only thing worse than a generically screwy thriller is one with a selective narrator -- and one that doesn't give viewers a fair chance to play along.
0,This one's DOA.

1,Pic is a fine example of old-fashioned story-telling and also will dance wherever detailed character development and leisurely-paced drama are appreciated.
1,"Although a tad sentimental, Vitus is charming and smart in how it deals with its fascinating central character, a very young child prodigy, and the problems he experiences because of his overheated brain power."
0,"To those of us for whom there can never be enough film dramas with a classical music backdrop, Vitus comes as a bit of a disappointment."
0,"There are few movies more infuriating than those that completely misjudge our reaction to their main characters -- and Vitus, alas, is at the head of that class."
0,"If writer-director Fredi Murer had sparked a more rebellious spirit within the project, he might have made a truly memorable fantasy for both children and adults."
0,"This was Switzerland's entry for the 2006 Oscars, and you can see why. Like most award-seeking crowd-pleasers, it places uncomfortable impulses in opposition then dramatizes them in the most unchallenging way imaginable."
1,Murer is a skillful director and has crafted a crowd-pleasing story that will have particular appeal to mature 'tweeners.
1,"Vitus, a fizzy domestic fairy tale from Switzerland, gives you a lift, as it revels in the oddball joy of genius as kid power."
0,Directed with a conspicuous lack of inspiration.
1,"We're supposed to be convinced that [Vitus has] proved himself a normal kid in spite of his virtuoso skills, not because of them. It's a bit of a stretch, but he's got the long fingers for it."
0,"Director Fredi Murer strains too hard for it to be something more, a magical opus about childhood and taking flight, in this instance literally and figuratively. You wind up feeling manipulated instead of emotionally moved."
1,"Vitus's cool intelligence, knotty narrative and precise performances make it a pleasure to watch even when it sends mixed messages about the true nature of its protagonist."
0,Gheorghiu's bad-seed severity has a creepy undercurrent.
1,"While the metaphor here may be too literal for some tastes, Murer shows how our families also give us the wings to fly."
1,"The cast is superb, especially the young actors who portray Vitus; [Teo] Gheorghiu is a real-life piano prodigy, lending an extra frisson to the intoxicating music that plays throughout the film."
0,"There are some likable elements to this unusual, erratic, ultimately frustrating film."
1,The more sentimentally inclined in the audience may even feel like applauding.
1,"[A] celebratory, family-friendly fable."
0,"Vitus freaks you out, but its makers seem to have no idea that it does."
1,"It's a simple, gentle tale that pulls its audience in almost imperceptibly; by its end, you just might be blinking away unexpected tears."
1,"A good example of making the differences work for you. Deep down, this is a film about childhood dreams and the determination to make those dreams come true. With such a positive message, you can't help yodeling on your exit from the theater."
0,"Oh, yes. I loved the music, but it's almost impossible to go wrong with Bach and Schumann."

1,"Definitely, Maybe is a surprisingly rewarding romantic comedy."
0,The romantic banter between Will and his three paramours strains for sparkling wit and only occasionally achieves it.
1,"Brooks' take on the ups and downs of modern romance and the unexpected turns it takes is smart, funny, and (above all) uncommon."
1,A romantic comedy that manages to be cute without sending viewers barrelling into the bathroom to toss their cookies.
1,"No one's a cartoon villain, and no one's beyond reproach, either. Everyone speaks like a grown-up."
1,"As the movie is about a character's growing into his own truth rather than discovering some preordained truth, Definitely, Maybe is hard to outguess. For once in a romantic comedy you won't be able to tell after 5 minutes who will end up together."
1,"Reynolds provides the perfect foil for these spiky women. Quietly masculine and so relaxed in his effects that he could be prescribed for anxiety, Reynolds exudes an elusive charisma that suggests Ryan O'Neal by way of George Gobel."
0,"[Adam] Brooks' movie has romantic ambition, something lacking in Hollywood romantic comedies of late. But he has made a slow-footed, long-winded comedy with more grins than laughs, an arm's-length romance with a real eye-roller of an ending."
1,"Definitely, Maybe has charm and some depth, even if it's ultimately more a third-base hit than a home run."
1,A surprisingly clever romantic comedy that starts brightly but unfortunately loses its spark at the end.
1,The picture does have a certain unimpeachable charm.
1,"Definitely, Maybe is definitely a cut above your standard-issue genre fare, maybe way above."
1,"Definitely, Maybe is a romantic comedy you don't have to feel embarrassed to embrace."
1,"It's no accident that the producers Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, are the pair responsible for such romantic comedies as Love Actually, About a Boy, Bridget Jones's Diary and Notting Hill, all starring Hugh Grant."
1,"Despite one of the more contrived framing devices outside an actual frame shop, Definitely, Maybe keeps you interested in its characters and isn't afraid of complicating your sympathies a little."
0,"Definitely, Maybe isn't a particularly good movie. It's hard to make either romance or comedy out of relationship wreckage, not to mention career ennui, and the pace is often meandering and sulky."
1,"Put simply, the film excels most at not being awful."
0,"[Reynolds] is -- once again -- better than his material, which relies too heavily on obvious sentimentality and lazy '90s nostalgia."
1,"Is Definitely, Maybe the best romantic comedy released so far this year? Definitely. Should you go see it? Maybe."
1,"Definitely, Maybe, written and directed by Adam Brooks, is a nimble and winning little romance."
1,"A romantic comedy with brains as well as heart, Definitely, Maybe is that rare studio release that feels like it was written by a human being, not by committee."
0,"To sum up, Definitely, Maybe is crap with compensations."
1,"There's really nothing terribly wrong with Definitely, Maybe, but there's nothing strikingly right about it, either; it's as good as it needs to be, and no more. It'll do in a Valentine's Day pinch, until something better comes along."
0,"It is, I suppose, a premise, of sorts, but as writer-director Adam Brooks's Definitely, Maybe galumphs along, it is not a particularly romantic or comedic one."
1,"It could use some editing toward the conclusion, but it's generally enjoyable, amusing and more sophisticated than most films in this genre."
0,"Releasing a movie on Valentine's Day can mean only one thing and, yes, Definitely, Maybe has it in big fragrant bouquets. Love, heartache and dollops of schmaltz."
1,"The big question isn't ""Does love exist?"" but ""Does love last?"", a resigned philosophy that shares the stage with crisp, sharp jokes and insightful moments of recognition"
0,"This slick romantic comedy has several things going for it, including an interesting premise and an attractive cast. Getting all its elements to cohere, however, is too often just beyond its grasp."
0,"The creative team here has ties to that Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones crowd, which may explain why so many of Ryan Reynolds's lines sound as if they might have been better delivered by a young Hugh Grant."
1,"The big news here is the intelligence, the balance, the real romance in Definitely, Maybe. No, it doesn't follow the formula. And really, how cool is that?"
1,"It won't be on anybody's 10-best list at the end of the year. But it's agreeable and engaging and real enough in the right smallish ways, and it has an emotional maturity at odds with the high-grade plastic from which it's constructed."
0,Everything feels derivative and nothing rings true -- it's The Way We Weren't.
1,Is this movie the best romantic comedy of the year? Maybe not. Do you walk out with a smile on your face? Definitely.
0,"Definitely, Maybe isn't terrible exactly, but it's bland, and in some ways that's worse. It's a romance posing as a detective story in which the solution is obvious and not worth the fuss."
0,This highly uneven comedy by writer-director Adam Brooks might be easier to take if it were less infatuated with its own cuteness.
0,"Will's eventual fate is of academic interest only. Definitely, maybe? Who cares?"
1,Tthe performances are very strong.
1,"Definitely, Maybe, which was written and directed by Adam Brooks, has charm and spirit."
1,It's sweet natured and brightly played.

1,"This over-the-top, ultraviolent, hyperkinetic action thriller pretty much has it all."
1,"Like it or not, Wanted pretty much slams you to the back of your chair from the outset and scarcely lets up for the duration."
0,"What looks set to be a boyish, pop-eyed fantasy warps into a welter of bloodletting."
1,Wanted has the kind of irresistible summer-movie allure that makes studio executives drool in anticipation. Even its title must swim before their eyes and transform into 'Want-to-See'.
0,"As the body count rises, so does the portentous tone, and the relentlessness of Bekmambetov's overamped style becomes oppressive."
1,"It's trash, but I love it anyway."
1,"Sure, you've seen plenty of this type of amped-up nonsense before... That doesn't make Wanted any less enjoyable."
1,"Wanted may be the most absolutely stone bonkers, crazy-good movie of the century. Or it may be a gargantuan piece of trash. Chances are it's a combination of the two. But man, does it rock."
1,"Before Wanted reaches the end of its wild course, the violence that's been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive."
0,"Wanted is an assaultive roller coaster of a movie that would be more fun if the violence weren't so nasty, and if the script made any sense."
1,Wanted is kind of unintelligible and idiotic. Also kind of nasty and brutish. And also undeniably kind of fun.
1,"It carries a bitter aftertaste, but by those low standards, it's a considerable success."
1,"A one-word review of Wanted would be ""Wow."""
0,"Timur Bekmambetov makes his U.S. debut with this big, cruel, stupid actioner about an office dweeb (James McAvoy) who gets recruited into an ancient cult of assassins."
1,"Wanted demands a high level of credulity, but in exchange it offers some rewards: improbable car-chases, gritty hand-to-hand combat and the sight of Angelina Jolie poured into her pants and packing a pistol."
1,A genuine thrill ride that has the added bonus of being an action movie you don't have to turn your brain off to enjoy.
0,Wanted hurtles past our eyes and ears too fast to register as much more than a video game.
1,The thrilling stunts and hyperkinetic action scenes are the undisputed stars of this surprisingly entertaining film.
1,"Jolie, thin as a wraith and as still as alabaster, reigns supreme as the queen of great screen objects, and Freeman has one of the film's funniest (if profane) lines."
0,"If you went for Sin City or Shoot 'Em Up, you'll probably enjoy Wanted. I like my trash with a little less fetishism when it comes to instruments of slaughter."
0,This is cinema for people who slow down at car wrecks.
1,"I've watched a movie that, while fiercely entertaining, made me fear for the emotional health of my gender. You have a problem with that?"
1,"If the graphic-novel-style hyperviolence of Sin City or 300 is your thing, go ahead and knock yourself out. Or let Angelina do it for you ... It feels so much nicer that way."
1,"Directed at a pitch of gritty giddiness by the Kazakhstan-born Timur Bekmambetov, this hard-R splatter-fest about a team of sanctified assassins is also the summer's zazziest action movie."
1,Director Timur Bekmambetov's gimmicks and the A-list cast sell the nonsense.
0,"Ultimately, watching Wanted feels like being privy to somebody else's unwholesome fantasy, one you'd rather not know about."
1,"Wanted is fast-moving and bloody, enjoyable even within its unapologetically generic limits. But McAvoy is its real secret weapon."
1,"It's a goofy, giddy bit of escapism."
1,"That Timur Bekmambetov's amped-up action flick Wanted makes absolutely no sense is entirely irrelevant. Your brain, in fact, can take a two-hour hiatus. But your adrenal glands will be working overtime."
0,"When the characters are on the run, Wanted can be a bloodthirsty crowdpleaser, a passable action flick to while away the summer hours. When they're explaining themselves, you almost wish they'd stuck to their original calling and made rugs, not war."
1,Wanted's hyperkinetic antics are sometimes weighed down by a surfeit of adolescent misanthropy. But the adrenaline-overdose strategy works for viewers as well as hit men.
1,"[Bekmambetov] hasn't just made a thriller with Wanted, he's redefined the genre."
0,"It's a chance to watch a bullet explode from the forehead of a killer -- and an invitation to laugh at the spectacle. See what you do, then tell me who's sicker: Bekmambetov or us."
0,The film's high proficiency is at the service of a concept that can most accurately be defined as sadomasochistic.
1,"Wanted is quite happy to judge a man by the size of his gun. The irony is that the biggest one here belongs to Jolie, and her Amazon smile indicates she knows exactly how nervous that makes the boys."
0,"Wanted shows life in the killing lane with lots of zippy effects, action and exploding heads."
1,This is a blockbuster busting out of the block; this is a Hollywood staple served up on a European platter; this is summertime fare with a wintry verve.
1,Wanted manages to deliver what action fans crave while still maintaining a veneer of artfulness.
1,Slams the pedal to the metal and never slows down.
1,"A 12-armed heavy-metal drummer of a movie, kicking and flailing through two hours of impossible. The car chase of the year."
1,"It's made for fans of films that really just want to see some great visuals, some amazing sequences and some terrific performances."
0,Bekmambetov made better films in Russia with far less money and more ideas.
0,Bekmambetov's movie evaporates pretty quickly after it's consumed.
1,"Wanted is too bloody, too over the top, too silly, and too special effects driven. It's also excessively entertaining and fun."
0,"Few movies ever have gone to such a length to tell so slight -- and, worse, unengaging -- a story."
0,"Vacuous, arid and terminally dull."
0,"If there were an award for the gloomiest movie of the year, Silk would win hands down."
0,"The stilted dialogue makes all of the actors sound as if they're being dubbed into English, badly, especially the English-speaking ones (Alfred Molina, looking seriously bored)."
0,What we're told in Silk is that Michael Pitt is a French 19th-century silkworm merchant in love with his wife but obsessed with a mysterious woman he glimpses on business in Japan. What we see is a mopey fellow without the energy to comb his hair
0,Limp satire.
0,"[Director] Girard confuses pretty scenery doused in ponderous music with epic visual poetry. Impenetrable musings intended to evoke ineffable romantic longing leave you scratching your head as you wait, ever more impatiently, for something to happen."
0,"Faithful to the book but much less stylish, it succeeds only in demonstrating that Michael Pitt can cause anyone's eyelids to droop when he's handed the leading role."
0,"The main problem is the casting, with Michael Pitt and Keira Knightley evidently competing to see who can be more attractive and vacuous."
1,"As sensuous as its title, Silk is an exquisitely felt love story that unfolds as delicately as a blooming flower. And as slowly."
0,"[Alfred] Molina, as Baldabiou, is the only cast member who transcends the material -- as he always does -- and his scenes are considerably more invigorated than the rest of the film."
0,"Although the period-piece film has all the trappings, from beautiful people to an obligatory sense of tragedy, it never follows through. In fact, its love story needs a shove -- it just lies there."
0,"Silk is a languid, too languid, story of romantic regrets, mostly ours, because romance is expected to carry the film without explaining it."
1,"Francois Girard's adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's novel is a visually arresting period piece, set in the 1860s, that addresses memory and loss."
0,It's a perfect example of how awful direction and performances can ruin an adequate screenplay.
0,Silk isn't just bad. It's utterly mad.
0,"Sensual but profoundly silly, Silk is ultimately little more than softcore porn with arthouse trappings, a moony, dopily romantic Red Shoe Diaries variation for the NPR set."
0,"Franois Girard's Silk is not merely painterly. It might as well be a painting, for all that it eschews storytelling, forcing the viewer to scan the lush imagery in search of clues to what, if anything, might be going on."
0,"Though elegantly staged, Silk is badly written and indifferently cast."
0,"Tremulous eroticism a-go-go, but it's all completely lifeless."
0,Dralon is more like it.
0,Crashing bore of a movie.
0,"Francois Girard's film proves a cross-cultural yawn, as if taking its cue from Pitt's blank-faced blandness and Keira Knightley's anaemic support."

0,"Unleashing Robin Williams in the least flattering possible manner, License to Wed squanders the modest chemistry between its appealing central couple uniting its elements in an astonishingly flat romantic comedy."
0,"Comedies don't get much lamer than License to Wed. Working from a flawed premise with characters lacking credibility and plot turns more moronic than funny, the movie flatlines in about five minutes."
0,"Somewhere along the way, somebody should have pulled this License, at least until the writers found funnier stuff for everybody to do."
0,License to Wed is another lamebrain Hollywood comedy in which a peanut gallery of the shrill and the narcissistic conspire to drive a wedge between two innocents.
0,"There's bad, there's awful and there's horrible, and then somewhere beyond that, in its own Kingdom of Lousy -- where all the milk curdles and the jokes aren't funny -- is License to Wed."
1,"It's highly amusing and its cast is extremely persuasive, playing the kind of roles that kill most careers: genuinely nice people."
0,"The movie is plodding, predictable, formulaic and, worst of all, not funny."
0,"All it does is make you wish [Robin Williams] never discovered movies -- or, at least, stuck to voicing cartoons and doing the odd, occasional drama."
0,"The movie is a pastiche of tortured slapstick, groan-inducing dialogue and a lethal dose of treacle, apparently awaiting one of Williams' trademark sprees of riffing and vamping to save the day. That moment never comes."
0,"It is only the latest attempt by a Hollywood studio to pander to prurience and piety in a single gesture, and to avoid giving offense by treating all possible factions of the public equally, which is to say like idiots."
0,Will Robin Williams ever divorce himself from the unholy union of silliness and sentimentality?
0,"Just another mediocre addition -- worse than the best sitcoms, better than the worst -- to the expanding list of movies that make Netflix a far more appealing option than going to a theater."
1,"Krasinski affirms that he can carry more than a desk job on The Office, and Moore plays straight gal in a film that improves, at least, on her last role in the ugh-inducing Because I Said So. License to Wed doesn't fail her this time."
0,The creepy-faced robot twin babies are funny (for a while); the rest of the film is not. It's like Meet the Parents with Dr. Phil as the officiant from hell.
0,"It's supposedly a romantic comedy, so imagine a couple of hilarious physical jokes -- you know, a guy takes a baseball to the face, ha-ha -- and channel in a few moments of Robin Williams doing his improv shtick around some key words."
0,"Anyone who has been through the process of church-mandated marriage preparation counseling should get a chuckle out of License to Wed, that is if the comedy weren't so badly handled."
0,"You'd never know from License to Wed that Krasinski is a big asset to The Office. Here, playing an unappealing male lead, he merely smugs his way through the assignment."
0,"This is the sort of lobotomized, condescendingly lazy movie that leaves you resentful of Hollywood."
0,"All poor Krasinski can do is sigh, look to the camera, and beg for deliverance."
0,"No matter how hard I try, I'm finding it difficult to write anything positive about License to Wed. This movie is bad from top to bottom, front to back, and start to finish."
0,The inert License to Wed shambles along one lame scene after another.
0,"...even if I could have put up with the unpleasantness of this as comedy, I still would have balked at the eventual portrayal of this monster [Williams] as an angel in disguise."
0,"I have rarely seen a movie with less self-knowledge than License to Wed, an awful comedy made ever so slightly fascinating because of its dual personality."
0,A blitzed-looking man stumbling out of a screening of this dreadful excuse for unromantic comedy volunteered that the best part of the movie was when Robin Williams got socked in the jaw. Couldn't agree more...
0,"Despite its fuzzy, getting-to-know-you message, the movie itself offers zero motivation for any of its protagonists."
0,"Like some weddings, License to Wed is a long sit and a bland buffet."
0,This assaultively unappealing 'romantic comedy' could well mark the opening salvo in a whole new Hollywood campaign against movie piracy. Anybody who'd steal this dud would stink just from carrying it around.
0,I hereby pronounce you a flop.
0,Williams is the worst offender. Even he finally seems to be tired of his own act.
0,"Forget about Saw, Hostel and all the other films in the new, notorious torture-porn genre. If you're looking for a really sick movie, check out License to Wed."
0,"Robin Williams is merely annoying in this comedy with a few lively laughs, but a nonsensical and uninvolving plot."
0,The worst film I've seen so far this year.
0,Robin Williams is back in this horrifically embarrassing and misconceived wedding comedy.
0,"Josef Goebbels had a home movie made of the failed 1944 Hitler assassins being hanged from meathooks with piano wire. It probably had more laughs, more fun, more feelgood moments than this family comedy."
0,Divorce is more fun than this film.
0,You end up loathing the Reverend so much that he leaves himself no room to bring you round to his side in time for the obligatory feelgood finish.
0,"It's exactly what it looks like from the commercials -- a one-joke movie, and that one joke isn't even funny to begin with."
0,Not a flake on the ground and we already have our first lump of coal.
0,"With Santa Claus movies like Fred Claus, who needs Ebenezer Scrooge?"
0,"The exceptional cast -- Vaughn, Giamatti, Kathy Bates, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz -- is an embarrassment of riches for a script this thin and this beholden to family-fare protocol, with its mushy-minded moral and slick sentimentality."
0,"The burden of having a famous sibling seems fraught with comedic possibilities, but whatever potential existed has been squandered and then some in Fred Claus, dumping coal into everyone's holiday stocking."
0,"Veers awkwardly from shrill, slapsticky physical humour to diabolical meanness (courtesy of Spacey as an efficiency expert) to reheated, snuggly sentiments about the importance of love and family."
0,"Constructed like a rattling Santa sack of stocking stuffers, most of them plastic, doled out with little confidence about what adults want from a jingle-bell comedy (we want Elf!), and even less about what engages a kid (they want Elf!)."
0,"Even though Vaughn knows how to build a pretty good performance out of little more than exasperated eye-rolling, he's just coasting here, and his scenes with Giamatti have no weight and no energy."
0,Bah. Humbug.
0,"This movie takes a good thing and runs it deep into the ground, leaving behind a frothy trail of sentimentality."
1,"Re-teaming with Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin, Vince Vaughn plays the eponymous character, Santa's crankier and considerably less charitable older brother, while doing all the riffing his PG straitjacket will allow."
0,An insipid Christmas comedy.
0,"Fred Claus seems a clever installment, not a seasonal classic, a buffet whose many nibbles you sample, move on and quickly forget."
0,"Vaughn's con-man jive doesn't get much play in this one; he spends most of his time as a bitter creep, and the writing (by Dan Fogelman) isn't sharp enough to make the hipster-at-the-North-Pole theme pay off in any meaningful way."
0,The film's multitude of flaws might be more easily forgiven if the movie didn't overstay its welcome by at least a half-hour.
0,"As derivative and predictable as any of the holiday comedies of the past few years, providing audiences with at best a handful of laughs. Most of it is uninspired."
0,It senselessly dims an idea that should shine as brightly as Rudolph's nose.
1,Vaughn gets plenty of mileage exploring both the painful and fun sides of Fred.
0,"A complete bust, derivative and uninspired, boring and dull, not funny, not moving and about a half hour too long."
1,"Fred Claus turns out to be not bad for a Santa movie, which I suppose could be interpreted as either faint or excessive praise, depending on your view."
1,"Friend, you may find yourself wondering how we ever survived the holidays without a Christmas dose of Vince."
0,"The satire on globalism and downsizing is also as old as the Clinton administration, but that doesn't stop director David Dobkin from selling it like fresh goods."
0,"There is more plot in the average Geico commercial, so the movie pads itself with detours into sketch ideas that don't develop past the basic concept."
0,About as funny as a sack of coal.
1,A pleasant little seasonal gift.
0,"The movie's constantly shifting timbre takes some getting used to, and it's hard to escape the feeling that a whole lot of actors (Rachel Weisz, Kathy Bates, Miranda Richardson) are wasted in a whole lot of roles."
0,An amiable but awkward Christmas bauble that depends too much on charm substituting for timing.
0,The eggnog quickly turns sour as the movie alternates between moments both heartwarming and bizarre.
1,"There's no more fleet talker flapping his lips with free associative aplomb than Vaughn, and he uses his edgy powers for good here."
0,"Like so many secular, big-studio Christmas comedies, this isn't naughty enough to be funny or nice enough to be uplifting."
1,[Vaughn's] naughtiness has never seemed so approachably nice.
0,Fred Claus is a tacky would-be comedy about family dysfunction that fronts some Scrooge attitude only to dissolve into slobbering sentimentality and canned uplift.
0,"Freely mixing reality therapy, fairy tale and satire, Dobkin's film does not maintain a consistent tone."
0,[Fred Claus] has apparently studied Elf and figured out everything that could have gone wrong with its fish-out-of-water Christmas fable.
0,Fred Claus ends up closer in spirit to Eugene O'Neill than it is to Dr. Seuss.
0,"The movie is less ho-ho-ho than uh-oh, or oh-no."
1,"There are some scattered big laughs and a sweet message here, so I'm giving it a mild recommendation."
0,What seems like fertile comedy territory turns out to be as barren as the North Pole.
1,"Dobkin's film is lit up by a couple of genius scenes: first, a siblings support-group attended by Frank Stallone, Stephen Baldwin and Roger Clinton; second, a superb in-joke triggering Spacey's redemptive thaw-out, stoking a festive glow against the odds."
0,"Fred Claus tries desperately for a Bad Santa meets Elf vibe. Five minutes in, the man sitting next to me was sound asleep."
0,"The actual effect of films such as this, however, is to put you in an entirely non-Christmas, non-joyous and non-charitable mood."
0,An archly mirthless comedy.
0,Fred Claus is in the grand tradition of a certain type of Yuletide farce - one that's about as funny as a crushed bauble in your egg nog.
0,The spirit of Scrooge surges strong within me having watched this chillingly cynical and unfunny Christmas movie.

1,Alvart does put the viewer through a gripping experience with a final twist few will see coming.
0,"Not content with a straight psychological police procedural, Alvart mixes in distracting -- and unconvincing --Biblical symbolism in a curious bid for weightiness."
1,"Steeped in religion yet shot through with moral ambiguity, this disturbing psychological thriller breathes new life into the moribund serial killer movie."
1,"It's a frightening, cleverly scripted picture that has much sport with the supposed contrast between the fresh innocence of countryside and the inherent corruption of the city."
1,"Like Hannibal Lecter with dentures, Antibodies lacks bite but still disturbs."
1,"The film's pace is brisk enough to maintain our full attention. Antibodies is not so much an art house movie as a well-made, commercial thriller that happens to be in German."
0,"Instead of reinventing the procedural mechanics of the serial-killer drama, filmmaker Christian Alvert adds to its current state of retardation with desperate atmospherics and a cheap disquisition on sex and religion."
0,"Antibodies brings together a philosophically minded serial killer, a devoutly religious cop and a cynical filmmaker clearly itching to go Hollywood."
0,A German thriller that isn't shy about ripping off The Silence of the Lambs.
0,
0,"As the film progresses, it becomes painfully clear there's no real point to the story; what we're witnessing is a cool, intellectual exercise, as devoid of character and motivation as the two psychos themselves."
1,"While I would stop short of calling Funny Games brilliant, I think it's forceful, unforgettable, and thought-provoking."
0,"I would absolutely defend Haneke's right to relaunch his broadside on our voyeuristic vices, but he's not keeping up with the times; he's behind them."
0,"Without ever acknowledging his own sadism, Haneke self-righteously lays his aesthetic and moral cards on the table."
1,Can a movie be gripping and repellent at the same time?
0,"You know what garbage is, but until you see Funny Games, a bucket of swill by Austrian wacko Michael Haneke, you have no idea how bad it can smell."
0,"Haneke's been quoted as saying he wants his movies to make people think, but Funny Games is 110 minutes of pure reptile-brain jolts (fear, mostly), with a couple of meta-narrative finger wags thrown in."
0,"Funny Games, Michael Haneke's first English-language film -- and a compulsively faithful replica of his notorious 1997 German-language feature of the same title -- subjects its viewers to a long spectacle of wanton and gratuitous brutality."
1,"A chilly and extraordinarily controlled treatise on film violence, Funny Games punishes the audience for its casual bloodlust by giving it all the sickening torture and mayhem it could possibly desire. Neat trick, that."
1,"[Director Haneke is] an adept manipulator who goes one better by calling attention to his manipulations, questioning them, and then, still, managing to freak us out in the coldest, cruelest ways."
1,"While the movie's star -- and ruler, and ship's captain, and grand poobah -- is Haneke himself, his actors are sublime."
1,Funny Games is about as hostile a jest as has ever been aimed at American audiences by a foreign director. The joke wouldn't be half as galling were it not so expertly written and executed.
1,"It's not a fun ride, but Funny Games forces us -- almost against our will -- to examine its characterization of violence and our response to it."
0,"In addition to being borderline unendurable, Funny Games is inexplicable, and I don't mean in any philosophical sense. Who thought the world needed a shot-for-shot English-language version of Mr. Haneke's 1997 German-language film?"
0,"While Haneke is attacking our culture for being drawn to violent fare, he is also relishing in presenting it to us, in prolonged and detailed fashion."
1,The performances are outstanding across the board. The direction and writing are masterful.
1,not what it appears to be on the surface.
0,A sour project that defines anti-imaginative.
0,Are you complicit for watching the stuff? Would you be less of a jerk if you walked out? Is [Haneke] wallowing in the thing he's critiquing and consequently a bigger jerk?
0,"There's no denying Austrian director Michael Haneke's skill as a filmmaker, but Funny Games is just a vile cinematic exercise."
0,"It's a pity the movie is so smug, gimmicky and heartless."
0,Michael Haneke hates you.
0,"Basically torture porn every bit as manipulative and reprehensible as Hostel, even if it's tricked out with intellectual pretension."
1,"If you're interested in intellectual abstraction, you might find Haneke's games intriguing. Just be warned: When the movie ends, you'll definitely feel like you've been played."
0,"Both versions of Funny Games force the audience to eat it, really eat it, and while they're eating it, to think about the mechanics and the narrative tropes of a typical revenge drama."
1,"The experience of watching Funny Games, be it the original or this version, is never forgotten, whatever your ultimate impression of the film."
0,"The worst of the violence occurs off-screen, but Funny Games is still a vicious, vicious movie."
1,"It's not exactly entertainment, but it casts a poisonous spell."
1,"You will be deeply disturbed, but you will watch obsessively. You will be haunted, and manipulated, and angered, and you will suffer pangs of guilt, too."
0,"It's one big ball of icky attitude, violence and nihilism."
1,All the things we hope from in a fright film with characters we recognize as very much like ourselves are toyed with.
0,"This isn't a movie, it's a thesis."
0,"The earlier release helped make him a critics' darling with its meta-movie touches and baldly articulated strategy of implicating the audience in the violence; replayed a decade later, those stunts feel both rhetorical and redundant."
0,Director Michael Haneke abhors mindless cinematic violence as much as you do. He just has a different approach: high-minded shock therapy.
0,"The fact that it features fine performances, talented direction and some moments of genuine suspense only makes the end product that much more grotesque and appalling."
0,"Haneke's assault on our fantasy lives is shallow, unimaginative, and glacially unengaged -- a sucker punch without the redeeming passion of punk."
0,That this relentless barrage of psychological and physical torture is extremely well made and powerfully performed -- Watts hurls herself into her physically demanding role with heroic conviction -- somehow makes it worse.
1,It's not a reassuring vision but that's not the name of Haneke's particular game.
1,"It's a tawdry kind of horror movie plot, given new meaning by Haneke's considerable intellect."
1,Registers more strongly than the original as a film about privileged white people...
1,"So whatever the shortcomings of this literary construct, it remains a joy to experience a movie so in love with good writing."
1,"Cast is first-rate all around, unafraid to play up the annoying, insensitive or self-pitying aspects of their nonetheless likeable characters."
0,The Jane Austen Book Club is an example of how a movie can follow the general plot of a book yet fail to capture the spirit.
1,"There's comfort to be had in the plot geometry of The Jane Austen Book Club, a photogenic adaptation of Karen Joy Fowler's 2004 best-seller."
0,"There's a difference between connecting to a writer's work and reading too much of yourself in it, and the banal film version of Fowler's book crosses the line six too many times."
1,"Swicord has a playful sense of humor and a good ear for dialogue, and the movie pleasantly accomplishes what it set out to accomplish."
1,"It's a funny conceit, and the actors -- who include Kathy Baker, Maria Bello, and Hugh Dancy -- are fun to watch. But the entire enterprise ultimately seems designed to turn Austen into a self-help guru."
1,"The Jane Austen Book Club is an admirable mix of heady and fluffy, the kind of wish-fulfillment fantasy that needn't make filmgoers ashamed of what they wished for."
0,Surely you must know you're still better off reading Austen on your own.
1,Austen devotees are sure to lap up the central premise that her notions of love and friendship are as relevant today as ever.
1,There isn't an actress here who isn't perfect.
1,"The Jane Austen Book Club is worth watching primarily for Blunt, the delicious scene-stealer from The Devil Wears Prada."
1,"This is a comfort film, the on-screen equivalent of mac and cheese -- though with a splash of truffle oil to class things up."
1,"[Swicord] has created characters who really do seem to have read the books and talk like they have. And she has created a book club that, like all book clubs, is really about its members."
0,The movie equivalent of a toenail-painting session.
0,As a friend said on the way out: At least no books were harmed in the making of this movie. And he's right. But that's only because no one really tried.
1,"An entertaining, carefully assembled piece of clockwork that imposes order on ever more complicated gender warfare."
1,"Despite its flaws, Book Club leaves viewers with that best result of Austen films: a wonderful ache to fall in love. It didn't pierce my soul, but it definitely lifted my spirits."
1,The cast alone makes The Jane Austen Book Club good -- though not great -- entertainment for at least the bookish moviegoers among us.
1,"Everyone is given their due and dignity in this funny, sexy, humanist film that, if it is a chick flick, gives the genre a good name."
1,"The script might have slipped into caricature, as often the adaptations of Austen's novels have, but Swicord opts for characters in whom we might see ourselves."
0,...Things never rise above the competent chick-flick level.
1,"The episodes roll by in smooth progression, and the talkiness has the round, impassioned tones of readers ignited by fiction."
1,The Jane Austen Book Club could be the start of a genre.
1,"The acting ensemble is as colorful, and thorny, as a garden of Austen archetypes."
1,Leave it to the Godmother of Chick Lit to inspire the best chick picture in many an age.
1,"This marvelously intelligent romantic comedy will captivate even those who don't know or care much about Austen, although there's undeniably an extra layer of pure delight to be found if you do."
1,"Unlike so many chick flicks that celebrate female solidarity as a concept without ever making us feel it, The Jane Austen Book Club is convincingly feminist in a nonpolitical way."
0,The real disappointment is the paint-by-numbers flatness of the contemporary stories and characters; it's hard to care much about Sylvia and Prudie with Elizabeth Bennett and Emma Woodhouse hovering in the wings.
1,Worth attending.
1,"Beyond the premise, there's nothing too surprising about this film from writer/director Robin Swicord, but it is perfectly agreeable."
1,"Just fine in a sentimental, mainstream kind of way. Although by constantly referencing Austen's sharp wit and characterisation, this can only ever come up short in comparison."
0,This is a rom-com that tries to be sassy and true but ends up ridiculously unlike any kind of reality at all.
0,A twittering soap opera about five Californian women using Jane as an agony aunt for their love problems.
0,The women are so seemingly at ease in their roles that the movie drifts towards its happy-ever-after finale without a missed beat.
0,"The contrivance is horrible, the schmaltz unpardonable."
0,"The Jane Austen Book Club, based on Karen Joy Fowler's bestseller, offers a distinctive vision of hell - a plane of being where there are only six novels that matter, and they're consulted like all-purpose agony aunts."
0,
1,"Tenderly depicting his characters' human foibles with low-key visual humor, Gillespie never condescends or goes for an easy joke."
1,"Lars might at first sound like a movie you wouldn't want your kids to see, but it has a heart of gold."
1,"Through small gestures and bold choices, [Gosling's] created a character you begin feeling sorry for and end up rooting for and almost envying, simply because he's found something (someone?) that makes him feel whole and alive."
1,"Lars and the Real Girl is an example of how even the most ridiculous premise can be used to construct a smart, touching motion picture."
0,Will no one talk to Lars honestly about the pitfalls of dating a golem?
1,Lars and the Real Girl is a tenderly observed and affecting Capra-esque fable that is well-acted and gently funny.
1,"Before you recoil in horror at the apparent grossness of yet another Hollywood high concept, you need to know that Lars and the Real Girl is anything but an exploitation film."
1,"What's remarkable about Lars and the Real Girl is the tightrope that [screenwriter Nancy] Oliver finesses, aided by her director and winning cast, between improbability and reality, edgy absurdist humor and melting tenderness. It's a tonic."
0,"There's nothing particularly 'real' about Lars And The Real Girl, just a couple layers of quirk several stops removed from the world as we know it."
1,"Directed with patient, low-key sensitivity, it never goes for a cheap laugh at its protagonist's expense."
1,"Lars is played by the endlessly fascinating Ryan Gosling, who perhaps has too much of a taste for damaged characters, but manages the tricky task of both playing Lars' feelings and hinting at their motivations."
1,The script by Six Feet Under writer Nancy Oliver eschews cheap laughs for character-driven humanist comedy.
1,"Working with a doll can't be easy, but Gosling actually makes it feel emotionally real."
1,This is a film whose daring and delicate blend of apparent irreconcilables will sweep you off your feet if you're not careful.
0,"Lars and the Real Girl is part comedy, part tragedy and 100 percent pure calculation."
0,I didn't connect with it.
0,You'll pardon me if I feeling like urping just a tiny bit at screenwriter Nancy Oliver's blend of pathos and heartland condescension.
0,"Even [Gosling] can창(TM)t guide us to the pulse within this pat material, and you have to keep reminding yourself which of the title characters is the plastic one."
1,"Gosling's performance is a small miracle, not only because he's so completely open as a man who's essentially shut off, but because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes."
1,"Almost impossibly sweet, a tale of love and kindness that's funny without being snarky."
1,"It's a premise as fanciful as Jimmy Stewart's Harvey, and yet the movie has a sweetness that manages to be pixilated and plausible at the same time."
1,"One could be led to expect something arch and knowing, but the film is anything but that. It's an emotionally invested movie about loneliness and the lingering scars of early trauma."
1,"Only after the movie is over do you realize what a balancing act it was, what risks it took, what rewards it contains."
1,Lars and the Real Girl is poised on the line between earnestness and farce.
1,"It's nothing less than a miracle that the director, Craig Gillespie, and the writer, Nancy Oliver, have been able to make such an endearing, intelligent and tender comedy from a premise that, in other hands, might sustain a five-minute sketch on TV."
0,The central gimmick of the film remains just that -- a gimmick -- as genuine emotion gives way to shaggy-dog shtick.
0,"The movie is convinced that its man-loves-mannequin premise is uplifting, when actually it's just kinda gross."
1,"Often howlingly funny, and the actors are a treat."
1,"Sweet, moving and heartfelt aren't necessarily the first words that come to mind when describing the tender tale of a young man and his sex doll, yet all three apply to Lars and the Real Girl."
1,Initially sounds perverted but ends up being just the opposite.
1,"It's the script by Nancy Oliver, the very idea of the thing, that steals your heart. Kink has never felt so sweet and decent."
1,"The most poignant, well-acted and weirdly funny movie you'll see this year."
1,"Both hilarious and poignant, with a Capraesque humanity that caught me completely off guard."
0,"Lars and the Real Girl remains suspended somewhere between perversity and pap, with only Gosling hinting at the mingling that might have been."
1,"A sweet little fable about how a delusional man-child is helped by the loving ministrations of his family and community, the kind of throwback flick where human nature is seen as inherently good -- a notion so quaint that it feels damn near buoyant."
1,...we're surprised to find that it's possible to feel a real emotional attachment to an anatomically correct girl made of quality plastic.
1,"Under Mr. Gillespie's admirably directed seriousness of tone, the performers, particularly Mr. Gosling, Ms. Mortimer, Mr. Schneider, Ms. Clarkson, Ms. Gardner and Mr. Reid, never miss a beat."
0,"While the film pulls a few punches, its off-kilter sweetness is as inoffensive and likable as a tepid cup of cocoa."
1,"Sweet and honest, but not much more."
1,
1,
1,"The film is often very funny. The acting is first-class, especially Gosling, who never patronises his character."
1,"Methodically relating the story -- as told by several of the U.S. soldiers involved -- whose leak to the media badly damaged U.S. credibility, Ghosts of Abu Ghraib makes grim but worthwhile viewing."
1,"Not only does the film thoroughly and skillfully explain the context in which something as heinous as Abu Ghraib could happen, it attempts to understand the psychology of those involved."
1,... the real lesson of Ghosts is that torture coarsens the torturer. We end up screaming at ourselves.
1,"The dramatic conflict is clearly enough etched and provides a sufficient feast of acting for this to work offshore as a specialist, upscale item."
1,Jim Broadbent perfectly captured Lord Longford's ability to get it all a bit wrong.
1,"Broadbent is excellent as a brilliant man whose heart eventually overrules his head. (Morton is stunningly good too.) What transpires is a tragedy, really, and wonderfully nuanced, and you must watch right to the end to feel its full, powerful impact."
1,A refreshing take on an overused theme -- dysfunctional father-son connections -- starts gently and gets more compelling as it glides along like a woodworker's sharpened plane over smooth surfaces.
1,"Possesses wisdom that is rare for film these days, let alone a debut."
0,"Yes, there's craft in Nealon's writing, but it seems more suited to the riffing non-sequiturs of episodic television than the narrative arc of a film."
0,The film and its makers simply try too hard. Director and co-writer Judy Hecht Dumontet can't stop 'helping' with overactive editing and scoring.
0,As flat as a tortilla and consid-erably less nourishing.
1,A classically made yet personally accented fable about the clash between old and new in a strange Andean village in Peru.
1,The assured debut of 29-year-old writer-director Claudia Llosa operates on several different levels.
1,"A familiar clash between old and new is rendered fresh and alive, with an edge of menace that slowly gets under your skin."
1,"10 mph, with its wit, beckoning shots of splendid landscapes, and impromptu interviews, might have you humming Woody Guthrie, This land is your land, this land is my land."
1,"Seen on an Imax screen, the now-familiar imagery of the devastation in New Orleans and other areas takes on a new resonance as the sheer size of the affected areas is felt more fully."
0,"While it attempts to be apolitical, the filmmakers short shrift of what happened during and after Hurricane Katrina weakens an otherwise worthy film."
1,"The devastation left by Hurricane Katrina has been well documented, but seeing it on a giant Imax screen makes it hit home in a way other media can't match."
1,It effectively showcases the indomitable spirit that has held the area together over the last year.
1,A convincing and entertaining argument for the importance of preserving Louisiana's wetlands.
1,"A classic 'before and after' document, terrific images of what was once there, actual footage of the storm itself, moving TV news coverage of the disaster and a conclusion that's more optimistic than it has any right to be."
1,"The smart, classy Hurricane on the Bayou preaches an invaluable environmental lesson for children and parents: Don't monkey with the ecosystem without expecting payback."
1,"Despite its split personality, Hurricane offers more good than bad, including a lively soundtrack featuring Benoit, the Neville Brothers and Fats Domino."
0,"Katrina will end up changing the entire South, from Houston to Florida, for decades to come, yet Bayou still insists on its upbeat gospel ending."
0,"The narrative is built one happy cliche at a time until the story of Katrina ceases to be about appalling environmental neglect, or the colossal failure of the federal government to manage a disaster."
0,"Unfortunately, there isn't much insight into this possible bleak future, nor is there anything new in this 89-minute film, which plays more like an episode of 20/20 or Dateline NBC."
0,You'll want to avert your eyes from this intense and intensely unpleasant drama about rape and revenge.
0,[Rosario Dawson] could have provided a 100-minute closeup and revealed more about human nature and anguish than all of Descent.
0,A well-acted trifle straining to be a hard-hitting morality play.
0,It's indie provocation trapped between shock and blah.
1,"It's a lot like a '70s exploitation movie, with its determination to seduce and shock the viewer with alternating currents of electrical stimulus, and its weird combination of arty arch-decadence and neo-Victorian moralizing."
0,"Look-at-me-I'm-a-filmmaker photography, pacing that has all the thrills of waiting in line at the post office and an utterly predictable plot combine to make the movie even worse than the hacky chick revenge fantasy now showing on channel 186 of your box."
0,No moviegoer has done anything to deserve the images that director Talia Lugacy would throw in their face.
1,[Dramatizes] the experience and the psychological aftermath of rape with a vividness I've never seen in an American film.
0,"Though a clearly gifted new filmmaker, Lugacy doesn't get a handle on the combustible material, and she gets scalded in the process."
1,"It's been a while since we saw a demagogic feminist exploitation revenge drama, and Descent, while top-heavy with 'agenda,' is shrewdly done."

1,"In A Peck on the Cheek, we get Ratnam at his best, albeit with a few glitches."
0,It backfires grandly.
1,"Rally Round the Flag, Boys! is no epic. But it's good for laughs."
1,Some of the gags are elaborate and as carefully timed as a dance sequence.
1,"Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman, who generally lend their talents to more serious roles, essay comedy here with just as satisfactory results."
1,"The 15th film in 35 years written and directed by Henry Jaglom, that love-him-or-hate-him iconoclast of American independent filmmaking, is also one of his warmest."
0,"It's a clunky, slack, directionless film that ultimately heads in a meaningful direction, but makes much of the route there seem unnecessary."
0,"Better pruning and different choices might have helped to shape the film into a more cohesive piece, instead of one so desperate to be funny that it sacrifices its honesty."
0,"Amateurishly put together and reverently self-referential it's hard to imagine this movie having much appeal for anyone beyond its own cast and crew. Given the apparent size of its budget, though, that's probably enough to make it profitable."
1,"Hollywood Dreams is a must for Jaglom fans. For other viewers, it will depend upon how much they can take of Jaglom's improvisational style and Frederick's over-the-top, tear-filled acting."
0,"The biggest problem is inexperienced lead Tanna Frederick, who overplays every scene."
1,"Knowing but never jaded, Hollywood Dreams is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching."
0,"Hollywood Dreams is meant to be an insider's tale, but it feels like it comes from the cinema of hangers-on."
0,The movie caves in on the issue of charm.
1,"[Director] Jaglom's scruffy style doesn't carry it through. He puts enough toxic insincerity on screen to singe, though."
0,The balance of this indie production (Jaglom's 14th) consists of his usual weakly improvised relationship comedy.
1,Jaglom's Hollywood Dreams are far closer to reality than they might seem. Unfortunately.
0,"It's the Hollywood dream factory as seen through [director] Jaglom's lens, and it's often out of focus."
1,"I've been among the unbelievers, but Hollywood Dreams turned me around -- to a point. Perhaps it's because the film is among Jaglom's best, love him or leave him."
1,This is one of Jaglom's most curious and oddly moving films.

0,"Poor writing, an indifferent production and sincere but often wooden acting make Season one big strikeout."
0,"There's not quite as much corn in The Final Season as there is in the Iowa farm fields that run through it, but it's close."
1,"The Final Season is as corny as an Iowa farm field, but as the World Series rolls around, fans of the sport might want to check out this tried-and-true tale of overcoming adversity, beating the odds and banding together for a righteous cause."
0,As corny as Iowa and as predictable as an intentional walk.
0,"The film's climactic baseball game does crackle with nail-biting energy, but the 90-minute lead-up is full of hokey sentiment and unearned gushiness."
1,"Star and executive producer Sean Astin must have hoped for another Rudy with this based-on-a-true-story sports picture, but The Final Season is actually an impassioned plea against school consolidation."
0,Sports movies have become so generic and so common that it takes something unusual or affecting to spark an audience. The Final Season has neither.
0,"Stereotypes are meant to exalt small-town values, but The Final Season is proof that it's hard to paint masterpiece in broad strokes."
0,"Perhaps if Disney had gotten their hands on it, The Final Season would have gotten the spitball polish it needs."
0,Why is it enjoyable to watch sporting events depicted when we know how the games will end -- how they have to end? Where does the tension come from? Why do we care when we know already?
0,"Belying the claim there's no longer any truth in advertising, The Final Season is exactly the formulaic, by-the-numbers movie it appears to be. These Tigers deserved better."
1,"Remarkably, the movie rights itself once the actual season begins, focusing on game strategy more than the usual heart-stopping pep talks."
0,"The US corn sur+ is in no way eased by The Final Season, an Iowa high school baseball saga that goes heavy on the inspiration, sports-movie cliches, and high-fructose syrup."
1,"An exciting family picture, worthy of viewing, if only for the warm-fuzzy feeling."
0,"Akin to hip-hop culture's misappropriation of Scarface as a tale of gangsta empowerment, writer-director Michael Caleo crudely latches onto the surface misanthropy of David Mamet's work to fuel his forgettable first feature."
0,"For all the good work that went into it, the movie is as phony as a game of three-card monte."
0,"While his cast is first-rate, director-writer Michael Caleo doesn't know quite what his movie is about."
0,[Writer-director] Caleo isn't able to sell The Last Time -- not the affair and especially not the ludicrous twist ending.
0,"Feels like a script that was written backwards, as if the twist ending occurred to [writer-director] Caleo first and he then filled out a story to get to it. Fair enough, except getting there in this case is just no fun."
0,Strives for contemporary noir in tone but feels closer to an ineffective parody of James M. Cain filtered through faux David Mamet dialogue.
0,
0,"Oliver wants to defend restorative justice, but his interest in this form of victim-offender mediation registers only as an afterthought."
1,"Dramatically, however, Take consistently works, and, with such a story, that's an amazing thing."
0,A woefully earnest indie about a crime and its aftermath.
0,It's like a full-length public service announcement.
0,"If there is anything the cinema needed less than another angst-ridden, cross-cutting tragedy about crime, fate, memory and redemption, it's the kind shot in an ugly monochromatic palette like Take."
0,"Obscured by ugly, dark photography, a jumbled script, mumbled performances, and clueless direction that make it impossible to see or hear a lot of what's going on even if you cared, the result is a film of monumental incompetence."
0,"This melodrama about capital punishment has no shades of gray, only beige."
0,Take is too enamored of its time-shifting gimmick and cheap suspense to ultimately have much impact.
0,"The talky redemption element, however, ultimately feels artificially tacked on."
1,Stylistically as well as thematically complex.
1,"Oliver's film manages to grapple with some knotty questions about justice, even if it is not nearly as bold or ironic as Lee Chang-dong's ""Secret Sunshine"""

1,Enjoyable low-budget black comedy.
1,Yet another hilarious cinematic depiction of a professional hit man's angst.
1,"With an eclectic mix of strong-minded thesps all pulling in slightly different directions, this shape-shifting genre hybrid successfully commingles 12-step therapy, romantic comedy and hit-man thriller."
0,"[A] precious, inert dud of a hitmen-are-people-too comedy."
1,"We've seen the inner lives of hit men and mobsters rendered innumerably in recent years on film and television, but You Kill Me does it in a satisfyingly comedic way, loaded with easily identifiable idiosyncrasies."
1,It has its amusements.
1,One of those rare occasions where going too low-key means missing many comic possibilities.
1,"You Kill Me may not look like much. But you root for it anyway, if only because it tries so hard to do the right things in a different way."
1,This crime comedy has such a goofy script and such an eccentric cast that it kept me curious about what would happen next.
1,"When Leoni's character learns what Frank does for a living, her look of puzzlement is marvelously subtle. You Kill Me has a lot of little moments like that."
1,"A completely amoral world delivered with wit and incisiveness, and great twists."
1,"For an hour and a half it exerts its own preposterous reality, making you believe it -- and like it."
0,"In the moment, You Kill Me is never less than mildly entertaining, and it's almost never more than that."
0,Eventually it's just too much of a bad thing -- and only leaves you wondering why you began it at all.
1,"You Kill Me really belongs to Kingsley, whose character's deadpan reactions to his new environment are priceless. He really kills."
1,John Dahl returns to the quirky black-comedy genre where he began his career in the late '80s. It's good to have him back there.
1,A film that manages to find sunbeams between the corpses and drunks.
1,Who knew there was such a high burnout rate in hit men? And who knew they suffered from so many varieties of treatable neuroses? And who knew they were such amusing guys?
1,"Leoni is a welcome sight here, temporarily giving up attempts at sunny-sexy blond roles and going with her sarcastic nature."
0,"No offense to Sir Ben, who does a mean deadpan, but his performance here is frequently more dead than pan -- which, given the material, was probably the wisest acting choice."
1,"With its shadows and gallows humor, You Kill Me goes about as dark as a comedy can go before turning into tragedy or self-parody."
0,"The story's grasping, eager-to-displease setup never establishes enough depth to be fully engaging, let alone metaphorically significant -- and why else make a movie about a psychotic kicking hooch in order to be a better killer?"
1,Everybody hits just the right notes...It's just a lot of fun.
1,"Along with the splendid principals, [the secondary cast] round out an extraordinarily accomplished ensemble."
1,"An unpredictable, enjoyable mob comedy."
1,"A strong performance by the reliable Kingsley, and a tartly sweet one from Leoni, keeps You Kill Me from turning into the bad joke the title implies."
1,A film whose deft blend of action thrills and gallows humor packs a jaunty kick and a firing-range boom.
0,"With strong lead performances and sure-footed direction, You Kill Me isn't terrible, it's just not nearly as smart or interesting as it should be or as it seems to think it is."
1,It's a predictable but acridly pleasant 12-step bonbon: self-help noir.
0,"Given a choice between a dark film with comic elements and a comedy that purports to be edgy, the filmmakers took the easy way out."
1,One of those self-consciously quirky indie films that will strike some as comic genius while leaving the rest of the audience scratching their head.
1,A lot more clever than it initially appears.
1,Surely there aren't many emotionally fragile mobster stories left in the Hollywood arsenal. But at least Kill is a pretty good shot with the laughs.
1,"The film isn't without its flaws, but in defying Hollywood convention, it manages to reach parts other comedies cannot reach."
1,"Domesticating the mobster within society has become almost a commonplace, thanks to The Sopranos, but Kingsley's tight-lipped gruffness gives a lift to the mordant ironies of the script."
1,"Ben Kingsley brings a batty, basilisk wit to You Kill Me, a black comedy about a dipsomaniacal?뎗itman."
0,"A badly written hash of a film, which will struggle to please even the most devout Sir Ben fans."

1,[Director] Bose embeds her history lesson in a drama with authentic emotional mother-daughter conflict.
1,"Good intentions do eventually trump mediocre drama and the climactic flashbacks of the riots, as Sikhs are torn out of homes and trains by murderous mobs, are the stuff of nightmares."
0,"Too bad first-time writer-director Shonali Bose's juxtaposition of the personal and the political often feels forced, and like many didactic history lessons, this one's about 20 minutes too long."
1,In Shonali Bose's tightly constructed debut feature (2005) a young Indian-American woman from Los Angeles returns to Delhi for the first time since childhood to visit her relatives.
0,Fails to grab the imagination as it unfolds in familiar TV-movie fashion.
1,"[Director Bose] has a genuine gift for atmosphere, making the many wordless scenes, in teeming streets and on crowded trains, the movie's best."
0,"The flat, pat talk is symptomatic of Amu's overriding problem: It has no sense of personal style."
1,"Amu, the ambitious debut feature by Shonali Bose, wears its political heart on its sleeve and is unafraid to tackle big topics: identity, history, truth, injustice."
1,"[Amu] is clearly a labor of love for the activist filmmaker, as she breaks all the traditional inhibitions of Bollywood to remind the world of -- and, for most of us, reveal for the first time -- one of the most shameful episodes in Indian history."
1,An admirable labor of love that stumbles dramatically but gets along on its sincere good intentions.
1,Less about finger-pointing than a plea for India to confront its past.
1,Shot with remarkable confidence and an understated eloquence.
1,
0,"With its recycled themes and muddled storyline generating a cascade of unanswered questions, the film is more about style than substance."
1,"An explosive, nearly sociopathic perf by Tom Sizemore anchors tyro helmer Michael D. Olmos' Splinter"
1,"Hardly earth-shattering, but illuminating nonetheless."
1,"If nothing else, 11/8/16 showcases the sad fact that there is no such thing as ""too soon"" any longer, because it captures not just a moment, but uniquely, a single event that changed the past, present and future all at the same time."
1,"A slow-burning psychological horror story, a portrait of a country in the moment its people all finally understood just what they were capable of."
1,"It's a tightly woven series of closeups of a diverse, divided populace."
0,"Too much of ""11/8/16"" feels superficial and unmemorable, despite the range of talents of the filmmakers and the interviewee demographics."
1,"The film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled. Judging by most people here, that won't be soon."
1,It's not an unsuccessful adaptation. But it rarely catches fire as one of Shakespeare's most popular plays should.
0,"Kenneth Branagh gamely continues to put Shakespeare on film, and audiences continue to ignore them."
0,"Kenneth Branagh is in danger of becoming the next Kenneth Branagh, in a career of serial self-replication as our last unstoppable screen Shakespearean."
1,"Branagh's direction is fluent, surefooted, a little broad sometimes; his ingenious Japanese staging recreates the wrestling match as a wacky sumo contest. It's elegant and Howard is very good."
0,"Faced with As You Like It, one of the Bard's more tiresome plays, Branagh's direction loses conviction and his storytelling lacks the engaging enthusiasm of his previous Shakespeares."
0,"With the director setting such a leisurely pace, the seventh step into total inertia takes hold well before the curtain drops."
0,Branagh's fifth foray into celluloid Shakespeare brings us this rather stodgy version of the Bard's wise comedy of old Japan.
0,"Unfortunately, Shepard's approach takes the movie into Jason Bourne territory and away from the black comedy he seemingly wants to make, making the film fall between the cracks in terms of boxoffice appeal."
0,"Alternately glib, superficial and amusing, pic vainly attempts to absorb some degree of Serbian irony into a story that's unavoidably lessened by its privileged American vantage point."
1,"Like many of the best movies about war and its lingering echo, The Hunting Party is full of dark humor."
1,Just brilliant.
1,"I left feeling a bit uncomfortable, but the fact that Shepard gets away with it at all is a testament to his talent."
0,"Compared to a great war zone movie about reporters such as Under Fire, The Hunting Party is thin stuff."
0,"A smart and tense diversion, albeit in a vaguely irresponsible way."
1,The strength of The Hunting Party is its shaggy-dog quality.
1,"Although Gere and Howard's characters are invented, they feel the truest of all. They are often more foolhardy than courageous, less brave than simply stubborn. They are not real heroes, in the classic sense. But they are simply real."
0,The film comes off more like a drunken recollection by a war correspondent than something that might actually have happened.
0,The opening credit disclaimer for writer-director Richard Shepard's The Hunting Party -- 'Only the most ridiculous parts of this story are true' -- didn't help me much. Everything about this political thriller is ridiculous.
0,"The biggest problem with the movie is the tone, which is by turns preachy, silly, mawkish and dark."
0,"The Hunting Party is a misfired, misguided would-be satire set in postwar Bosnia."
0,"The Hunting Party is a not dark enough, not comic enough dark comedy about the aftermath of the Serbo-Bosnian War."
1,"Politics aside, The Hunting Party is a breezy, occasionally bumpy ride that ultimately becomes a satisfying journey."
1,"[Director] Shepard strikes just the right absurd, satirical tone until near the end, when he allows the film to wrap up a bit too conveniently."
1,"A sour, disenchanted war comedy that affects a breezy style, The Hunting Party was originally called Spring Break in Bosnia."
1,"On paper, there's no way that The Hunting Party should work. But onscreen, it defies the odds."
0,"If the director traffics in the realm of black comedy, any attempts to win us over or encourage sympathy or empathy with the rollicking hell-raisers on screen tend to give off a bad odor."
0,"A forgettable contribution to all those movies about tormented, gonzo newsmen, stranded in some hellish outpost (in this case, Bosnia), who drink to drown those terrible memories but are committed to news, news, news."
1,...The Hunting Party still is a movie worth chasing down.
0,"The Hunting Party is a complete bust, but the ways in which it fails are interesting."
1,"...it does make room for the latest, loose-screw character part in the reinvention of Gere's career."
0,"The Hunting Party has good aim, but just misses."
0,"When something seems too bizarre to be true, that's generally how it plays onscreen."
1,"As they say, the difference between movies and real life is that real life does not have to make sense. And that is what it takes to make crazy times real to us in a way that the truth cannot convey."
1,...The Hunting Party derives much of its tension from watching seemingly 'normal' people doing seriously insane stuff.
0,"By the time the end credits roll, you're still not sure what kind of movie The Hunting Party is supposed to be, other than just queasy."
0,The action plot is lousy with cliched suspense scenes of back-road executions halted at the last possible instant.
1,"Ludicrous, bewildering, and largely true (at least the ""most ridiculous parts"" according to the film's preface), it plays like an adventure story written by Kafka"
1,"Wilson makes it clear that he doesn't share Moore's political beliefs, but the film isn't about ideology as much as accountability. The theme is: How does he get away with it?"
1,"Now despite that mean-spirited and unfair title, this is an honest attempt by one young filmmaker to examine Moore's controversial methods and to question his politics."
1,It's kind of a sweet movie in it's own way it's not really angry about anything.
1,"Far more jocular, good-natured and thoughtful than Moore partisans might expect."
0,"Visually dull, without an ounce of cinematic purpose, pic will work most effectively on the small screen."
0,The film's plea for tolerance is commendable but would have more weight if only it were executed with more panache.
0,The tone is good-natured enough to make a simple movie semi-watchable.
1,"Looking for plot holes? You can't miss them. But if you go in hoping for a good time, you'll find that, too."
1,"Mr. Jamal's direction ranges from clumsy to competent. Fortunately, even as Mr. Jamal's characters hit notes reminiscent of a half-baked television pilot, they disclose eccentricities that his cast spins into comic gold."
0,"Overwritten and under-directed by Maurice Jamal, the movie contains several honest moments but remains too awash in clich (C)s and stereotypes to take seriously."
1,"After a lacklustre start, Evil Aliens builds up a crazed momentum."
0,"Before he started turning out $200 million fantasy epics, Peter Jackson used to do this sort of thing while napping, and he was much better at it."
0,When Lee's finally called upon to yell the trademark 'Alllllvin!' it feels like a forced whimper that only reminds us how stale the decades-old material is.
0,"There's just not enough here for a movie. It's almost as if some ideas were meant to live for three and a half minutes each Christmas season, not to get stretched to the breaking point for 50 years."
1,The sight of enhanced Alvin and the Chipmunks in the movie of the same name is far less squirm-inducing than one might have feared.
0,"What happened to Alvin, the rodent counterpart of Dennis the Menace? Was he declawed in the translation to CGI?"
0,"The characters are underwhelming in their appeal, lacking the charm of their previous animated incarnations."
1,A harmless and frequently humorous trifle.
1,It's a fine-enough kids movie. Cute. Nice lesson. And better than you'd think.
1,"Thanks to Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Fab Fur make a comeback any pre-K kid would love."
0,"Alvin, Theodore, and Simon have the only good lines or recognizable emotions, with Jason Lee and David Cross straining to flesh out their cardboard roles."
0,"Hollywood continues its tired milking of old television properties with Alvin and the Chipmunks, a slick updating of the musical-cartoon franchise."
0,"Alvin and the Chipmunks goes in one eye and out the other, featuring a CGI Alvin, Simon and Theodore interacting with a human-ish world."
0,"Sure, rodents are hot this year. But unlike Ratatouille's chef prodigy Remy, these mischief makers bring nothing new to the table."
0,"Me, I want a hula hoop."
0,This film features what look like living +h toys.
0,"Between the occasional amusing joke and catchy musical number, this Alvin update is a very soulless movie."
0,"For adults, it's like being hit over the head with a mallet every 10 seconds for 90 minutes. Two days later, I still had a headache."
0,"Oh, come on. Do you really care? And even if you do, you shouldn't."
1,"Dang it, the little animated rodents are cute. Not as cute as the 체ber-rendered daemons of The Golden Compass, but they'll do."
0,"Ah, nuts."
1,"Young viewers will enjoy the slapstick, while parents will relate to Lee's amiable frustration as the trio's surrogate dad."
0,"I was also grateful that Alvin wears a red sweater with a big 'A' on it as an aid to identification, since otherwise all the chipmunks seem to be identical, like Mutant Turtles or Spice Girls."
0,The script leans heavily on the pranks and big-eyed cuteness of the li'l guys and leaves the live actors with unfunny dialogue and nothing to do.
0,"By the end of the movie, even the Chipmunks' youngest fans will find themselves wishing that Alvin and the boys would get back to where they once belonged: a tree."
0,
0,It's fairly awful.
0,"With such a thin plot, the CGI here is adequate yet underwhelming, and the same can be said for the gags"
0,The musical numbers are initially appealing - think close harmonies and smart foot stepping to the likes of 'Funkytown' - but the novelty is likely to wear thin for adults when the 'munks get kitted out as a street boy band.
0,It's one of those movies where the wretched actors have to pretend to know what's going on as the CG effects take place beside and around them. They do their best. But it's Alvin and co that toddlers will appreciate.
1,"An endearing effort that will appeal to under-10s with its slight tale of the three all-talking, all-singing rodents."
0,Pure hell.
0,Is it for kids? Adults? Marsupials? Martians? Who can tell. Jason Lee from My Name Is Earl stars - if that is the word - in this thoroughly brain-dead semi-animated family comedy.
0,It's the kind of family entertainment that makes you reach for the shotgun.

1,"As Verhoeven's film makes clear, many thousands of surviving German veterans, along with a disturbing quotient of their children and grandchildren, are much too eager to make excuses."
0,"The film eventually becomes one long therapy session for the German nation as it struggles to understand how its brave and good soldiers could have done such bad, bad things."
0,"Once the film gets mired in specifics, it begins to seem like any other Holocaust documentary and loses the sense of relevance and engagement with the now that at first makes it so intriguing."
0,Story would be easy to take more seriously if the technique weren't so unpolished.
1,"Amid a recent flurry of low-budget independent productions, Coffee Date is a standout with its strongly developed central characters, complex themes and polished look."
0,"Coffee Date has lots going on, and its message -- there are all kinds of love - is an earnest one. But the script relies too heavily on stock characters and overused plot devices to make any real impact."
1,"Coffee Date is a likable, extremely goofy piece of fluff."
0,"It's so full of bland good will, the story goes nowhere in romantic-comedy terms."
1,A warmhearted tale carried by genuine affection and a charming cast rather than cutting one-liners and turbo-charged plotting.
0,"Leaving no clich unturned, Coffee Date provides cheesy music, chats about gaydar and the obligatory are-you-looking-at-mine? urinal scene."
1,It's clever and sweet and pretty consistently funny.
1,"Dennis Quaid scores an emotional touchdown in this sturdy, factual football drama."
1,"Rob Brown's performance in the title role is solid and static, but Dennis Quaid's portrayal of coach Ben Schwartzwalder provides a convincing metaphor for a nation going through a crisis of conscience."
1,Combines and surpasses both genres by virtue of its honest-to-gosh goodness.
0,"Davis deserves to be remembered, but as professionally crafted as The Express is, the movie is an almost instantly forgettable version of his life."
1,"Has Dennis Quaid really never played a college football coach before? With his handsome, craggy face and likable intensity, he was born for the job."
1,"While Ernie's on-field accomplishments were extraordinary, it was the environment in which he struggled to achieve them that makes him the worthy subject of a motion picture."
0,"We're not asking for another Brian's Song, but does Davis's tale have to seem like a rehash of Remember the Titans?"
0,"Based on a Davis biography, Gary Fleder's account is a noble attempt at humanizing the myth, but it succumbs to the worst sorts of sports-movie clich챕s."
0,"The Express eventually reaches its triumph-of-the-human-spirit climax, but it yanks too hard on the heart strings during the long journey there."
1,"The Express finesses a cinematic hat trick: It's entertaining, deeply moving and genuinely important."
0,"The Express raises the following rhetorical question: Was Davis' life really that by-the-numbers bland or have the filmmakers airbrushed out all the prickly, complicated details?"
1,The Express is involving and inspiring in the way a good movie about sports almost always is.
1,The Express tells the true story of college-football star Ernie Davis. It's such a naturally compelling tale that one wonders why it hasn't been filmed before.
1,Consider that a virtue in a movie content to teach familiar messages without overstating them.
0,"No matter what the very capable actors do to shake up the characters, they stubbornly remain types."
1,"The player, coach and even the wise grandfather figure played by Charles S. Dutton have at least one more dimension than the typical sports-movie stereotypes."
1,A far more intelligent movie than the ads might make it seem.
0,"Sadly, however, this is all too familiar, which is something nobody could say about the real Ernie Davis."
1,"Packages a real-life story of athletic triumph and social progress into an accessible, rousing melodrama that is no less potent for being almost entirely predictable."
1,"The movie might be a bit more interesting if Davis had more to him than simply graceful gumption and victimhood, and if the spaces around him could be filled with something."
1,"At times stirring, inspiring and thoughtful."
1,The Express plays for our sympathy -- and wins.
0,The Express is a somewhat ordinary movie about an extraordinary life.
1,The Express delivers visceral gridiron energy. Fleder and his crew capture the moments so many athletes refer to as 'being in the zone.'
1,"Davis is played winningly, without a single false note, by Rob Brown. His coach, the irascible but decent Ben Schwartzwalder, is brought home beautifully by Dennis Quaid, who has quietly become one of America's finest actors."
1,"Director Gary Fleder does an end run around the genre's cliches, and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau plays with desaturated color and highlights for a rich period feel."
0,"Aside from managing to get made at all, the movie doesn't do Davis's legacy any favors by giving us the store-brand version of his life."
0,"Looking for a safe investment in this wildly sliding economy? Well, don't bother flipping to the ROB because here's a tip you can take to the bank: Buy shares in the Clich챕 Factory."
0,The Express may prove valuable to movie historians since it's a compendium of virtually every sports movie clich챕 ever contrived.
0,"The film does the job, in its conventional way. But it's geared to throw the prime screen time in the direction of the guy playing the guy coaching the guy who's supposed to be running the movie."
1,"Despite appealing performances and kinetic football scenes, the storytelling is mostly conventional, except for two outstanding set pieces."
1,Rob Brown did a nice job.
1,"Football fan or not, definitely be sure to see it."
1,The sports-movie template is capable of absorbing any story and delivering the same uplift.
0,"Full of stirring speeches and manly chins quivering with emotion, every frame is a clich챕."
1,"Gary Fleder's sporting drama has its heart in the right place but, sheesh, that title grows more ironic with each crawling minute."
1,"A tidal wave of corn syrup hardly mars this old-style, populist entertainment."
0,"Steams ahead with express-train determination, scooping on to its cow-catcher any cinemagoer hoping he can outrun yet another true-life drama about black sportsmen overcoming bygone bigotry."
0,"The screenplay is stewed in such pieties, served up as warm and homely as apple pie - only there's no taste to it."
1,"Mesmerizing morality play, rich in rare archival footage and complete with heroic Allied saviors."
1,"Fortunately, historical facts far outweigh psychological speculation in The Rape of Europa."
1,The doc is an excellent survey of the techniques employed by the Third Reich to not just demoralize but de-historicize the countries they invaded.
1,A fascinating account of art's fate during the rise of the Third Reich and the Second World War.
0,The movie doesn't dramatize this crime -- it catalogs it. With deadening monotony.
0,"The directors (Richard Berge, Bonni Cohen and Nicole Newnham) have their hearts in the right place. But their film is uninspired in style, and Joan Allen's narration is dry."
1,This meticulously rich documentary chronicles the cultural scavenging of the Nazis and the heroic efforts of art patrons and ordinary citizens to hide the treasures.
1,Much of the documentary shows in gripping detail the efforts to save Europe's treasures from Hitler's clutches and the ravages of war.
1,"All in all, an exciting and terrifying new perspective on an era you probably thought you understood."
1,"Europa starts to lose its tight focus and becomes a cinematic cataloguing of events across seven countries. Given the moral imperative at the heart of the movie, however, perhaps more is more."
0,"Not helping matters are Joan Allen's blanched tones as narrator, or the general flatness of the talking heads."
1,Surprisingly vast and involving.
0,"This one has focus trouble, canvassing too many countries, too many issues, and the filmmaking is on the ordinary side."
1,A startling documentary.
1,"Filmmakers Richard Berge, Bonni Cohen, and Nicole Newnham do a superb job of telling this neglected story in vivid detail."
1,"There is a heart-rending feeling to this documentary, in part due to its sense of irretrievable loss."
1,"As thorough as the movie is, it could easily devote another hour to cases like this."
1,"This is a vast subject, ideally suited to a series of films. It's at its most moving when focusing on the small stories of individual artworks taken from their owners and restored to the families decades later."
1,"It's long for a documentary, almost two hours, but it has a big story to tell."

0,One begins to pity Graham for having walked into such a transparent booby trap.
0,The only thing more tired than a tarted-up movie about junkie codependence starring attractive performers emoting junkie-like is a tarted-up movie about losers in an all-night diner. Broken combines both clichs.
0,"Tiresome and turgid, Broken has nothing to say and says it slowly. Even the sex scenes are a bore."
0,Ideas aren't enough to overcome a badly organized structure and often stilted acting.
1,"If Broken defies basic credibility, it is at least well acted."
0,Heather Graham's would-be singer-songwriter in Broken is a walking clich in a film overstuffed with them.
0,"Broken is a pretentiously time-fragmented, tedious slog."
0,'Why?' you may wonder as the end credits roll on director Alan White's Broken.
0,"[The] script is so uneven that the result is like watching four different, equally bad, movies."
0,Formulaic soap opera has the makings of camp but the heart of an after-school special.
0,"Great title, shame about the movie."
1,A strange and compelling Kafka-esque account of an American artist caught up in Bush's war on terror.
1,Younger filmmakers should be looking to Hershman Leeson for lessons on how to reinvent old forms while at the same time telling an urgently topical story.
1,"Filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson spins an essay on art, government, play-acting, and paranoia; it's easily her best film yet."
1,The real-life events chronicled in Strange Culture support the argument that the federal government is more inclined to create fear than contain it.
1,"Echoing the 2006 Oscar-winning German film The Lives of Others, Leeson's film is a scary testament to the power of fear."
1,"Slipping in and out of character, variously embodying, studying, and commenting on their counterparts, the actors manage both dramatic reenactment and its deconstruction with aplomb."
1,A terrible personal tragedy and a penetrating case study in the intolerance and paranoia that still surrounds avant-garde art in America.
1,"Somewhere between documentary and dramatization, fact and impression, Strange Culture molds one man(TM)s tragedy into an engrossing narrative experiment."
1,"As sad as it is to realize that youth activism in this country is dead, it's sadder still to find yourself agreeing that they have a point."
0,Outrage overkill that gives as much weight to the government trashing Steve's house and locking his cat in the attic as it does their desecration of the First Amendment.
0,The personal and mass chaos that would result if the human race lost its sense of vision is conveyed with diminished impact and an excess of stylish tics in Blindness.
0,Earnest and dreary.
0,"As the players enact the fall and rebirth of civilization, Meirelles suggests that even a society gone to hell looks better with a little music-video-like pizzazz."
1,An absorbing (if admittedly flawed) thought-piece. It engaged me throughout and I found the ending to be surprisingly hopeful.
0,"Blindness feels at once honorably serious and way too pleased with its own soothsaying. You stagger from the dimness of the cinema, beaten down and longing for the light."
0,"Fascinating as sci-fi, paltry as a parable, Blindness is one of the movie year's most daring failures."
0,"The extremes are so barbaric few audiences will sit through them, and despite the allegorical intentions, the apocalyptic literary views in the Jos챕 Saramago novel upon which it is based fail to translate coherently to the screen."
0,"There's a good movie here, but we get it in pieces that are sometimes hard to decipher."
1,Blindness is a face-first dive into the horror of human nature -- call it Lord of the Blind Flies -- with several memorably harrowing scenes and a compelling cast.
0,Blindness is provocative cinema. But it also is predictable cinema: It startles but does not surprise.
0,"It is an allegory about a group of people who survive under great stress, but frankly I would rather have seen them perish than sit through the final three-quarters of the film."
0,"In his effort to make a grand statement, Meirelles piles on the drama, as well as the affectations. The resulting effect dilutes the film's power."
0,"Blindness is a glum, ugly film, and pretentious in the bargain. But, perhaps least excusable, it is a fundamentally ill-conceived film, the visual depiction of a world without sight."
0,"It's a beautiful car that never quite cranks up. The book is deep allegory, lost in time and place, describing a suffocating little world. It's hard to get at that in cinematic form."
0,"The film is an often thought-provoking metaphor. But as a thriller, it becomes dreary."
0,"This film rests uneasily between art and thriller, putting a huge burden on the actors, especially Julianne Moore, to convey the larger meaning of the story."
0,Fernando Meirelles' Blindness is film as punishment; a literate and thoughtful work that's nonetheless so relentless in its bleached-out misery that you want to look away.
1,"Too many scenes strike the same note, and, at times, Blindness seems like a premise in search of a story, and an allegory in search of a meaning. But in its methodical and uncompromising way, it gets where it needs to go."
0,"Dully written, ponderously paced and full of one-note characters acting exactly as we'd expect."
0,"I kept hoping the meaning would click into place, but it never quite did. The story seems designed to apply to whatever fear is nibbling around your subconscious."
0,"For all its pretension and artiness, Blindness is more like M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening (which at least had the decency to be fast-paced and short), right down to its upbeat and inane conclusion."
1,"Fernando Meirelles' awkward, repulsive yet richly imagined film uses sightlessness as a trigger for the breakdown of society."
0,Doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before.
1,Blindness leaves indelible images and unnerving feelings about physical and social disintegration. It is not easy to stomach.
1,"A perversely enjoyable, occasionally harrowing adaptation of Jos챕 Saramago's 1995 disaster allegory."
0,The figures in Blindness have no names; that's how deep into the Valley of Allegory we are.
1,"The descent into barbarism ??hallways fouled by human waste, cruelty 'round every corner ??is both the device and the point ..."
0,"Murky and grainy, and showing human beings at their grimmest -- thievery, rape, betrayal, murder -- Blindness is no barrel of laughs. But it is a barrel of pretentious metaphorical musings."
1,"Blindness is not a great film. But it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like."
0,"If you've read Lord of the Flies or Animal Farm, you'll know how things progress."
1,It's the rare movie that dissects the blackness of the soul; rarer still are ones that manage to find the darkness beautiful.
0,"Set in a nameless English-speaking city where people are suddenly stricken with sightlessness, it's an allegory that never rises to the level of believability."
0,A sour and unexpected shock.
0,"Stilted, claustrophobic and more stylish than substantial."
0,"Sadly, 'Blindness' may realise its director's worst fear: to produce not only an exploitation B-movie but one, paradoxically, spoiled by its own integrity and misplaced 'artistic' mise-en-sc챔ne and intentions."
0,"His actors do their best, and Moore certainly remains a powerhouse presence whenever she's on camera. But mostly they struggle to be seen beneath the leaden messages."
1,"Meirelles, along with screenwriter Don McKellar and cinematographer Cesar Charlone, have created an elegant, gripping and visually outstanding film."
1,"There is much to admire about Blindness, but this striking work is all too often undermined by its sense of its own importance."
0,Rhubarbed melodrama.
0,"It's prurient, sentimental, and baffling to boot."
0,It's a nightmarish vision but also a bit of a mess.
0,"I have to admire a mainstream movie that's so overwhelmingly bleak, but that's the only real distinction of this dystopian sci-fi drama."
1,"The film is far from dull or careless but it's not convincing as a lesson in human frailty. If you're going to subject us to this much degradation, it has to be irresistibly believable, not just relentless."
1,
0,"This strained heist comedy about three cash-strapped femmes is watchable enough for a few reels, but lacks the requisite wit and amoral energy to capitalize on its get-rich-quick premise."
0,[An] improbable and generally unfunny comedy.
1,"While it's all so breezy and zippy and girl-power peppy, it's Keaton who makes Mad Money worth a few bucks."
1,A mild comedy that penetrates its see-through cellophane wrap with a few good laughs and many performances that are even better.
0,Mad Money strains desperately for laughs.
0,The big problem with Mad Money is not that the situation is implausible -- this is a caper; it's supposed to be over the top -- it's that it doesn't do the work necessary to con us into believing it.
0,"The scheme works for a while. Sadly, the movie never does. As a heist film, it relies on the trio of felonious females besting a system that seems laughably easy to outwit."
0,"Mad Money is a comedy caper where the caper's not interesting and the comedy's not funny. Take away those elements and all that's left is a tepid female buddy movie and, like its male counterparts, we've had enough of those to choke a critic."
1,"Mad Money, a sisters-in-greed heist comedy that's like Fun With Dick and Jane crossed with Set It Off, may be a formula flick, but as directed by Callie Khouri, it gives you a good, infectious dose of its heroines' money fe"
1,"Mad Money is no Rififi, but Khouri and Gers invest it with an individuality and generosity of spirit that lift it into the realm of guiltless pleasure."
0,It's all in service to a workaday script that leads to a cop-out of an ending that makes the whole thing seem even more generic than it should.
0,"This movie is designed to be fun, and its intentions are signaled to us over and over again, as when the women jump around on a bed, giggling and flinging old, dirty money around in a wanton display of pure idiocy."
0,"Speaking of recycling, this script by Glenn Gers reeks of it and not in a healthy, eco-minded way."
0,Moviegoers will come up empty.
0,It's not that much fun.
1,Mad Money is small change that somehow manages to add up to a satisfying sum.
0,"This is an odd, disposable movie; it melts away as you leave the theater, leaving nothing but vague dissatisfaction behind."
0,"It's just OK, one of those decent little movies that get released in January."
0,It's just a lot more sane and tame than its 'mad' title would have you believe.
0,"Holmes, with Alice Cooper hair and crazy Jim Carrey eyes, looks terrible and acts worse, unless this movie is unintentionally a lobotomy documentary. Whatever could have happened to her in the last couple of years to zap the talent out of her like this?"
0,"When someone takes our money without offering much in return, don't we have every right to get mad?"
0,"If you're going to make a heist picture, then at least have the decency to make the heist itself interesting."
0,This leap might be a bit easier to take if the robbers involved weren't all straight from the female stereotype handbook. And if any of their male companions were given an ounce of credibility.
1,Leaves one pondering the ways audiences abet amorality tales.
0,The best thing you can say about Mad Money is that it has a good cast. The worst thing you can say about it is that the cast is extremely ill-used.
0,"he stars phone in their expected personas (Keaton testy, Latifah earthy), except for Holmes, who's unconvincing as a gum-chewing trailer babe."
0,This movie scared me. What is it saying about us? This is basically a bunch of rich people celebrating pathological greed. There's nothing satirical about the film.
0,This movie is awkwardly structured.
0,"There is little suspense, no true danger; their plan is simple, the complications are few, and they don't get excited much beyond some high-fives and hugs and giggles."
0,A likable and completely dispensable heist film.
0,"The pocketing of tired bills headed for the shredder, the producing of tired movies headed for the theatre -- it's all just recycling."
1,It's better than I expected it to be.
0,"There's an old saying: 'I wrote you a long letter because I didn't have time to write a short one.' In the case of Mad Money, I'll write a short review because the movie won't sustain a long one. (It barely sustains itself.)"
0,"The latest vibrato performance of Diane Keaton's late career shame has her playing once-wealthy housewife Bridget Cardigan, whose twee name and dithering hysteria are equally insufferable."
1,
0,A 'true story' of ghosts and illness suffers in comparison to the director's attention-getting short Ward 13.
0,A based-on-fact ghost story that's long on atmosphere yet short on dramatic tension.
0,About as scary as a shower that suddenly changes temperature when someone flushes the toilet.
0,"The writers, ""true story"" or not, were plainly recycling Amityville story structure. So credit editor Tom Elkins with the scares that work."
0,"The eerie buildup is mostly pro forma... But the backstory of the haunted house, revealed slowly in sepia-toned hallucinations, really is creepy."
0,"What started out reasonably scary, if derivative, just drags on and becomes silly."
0,"Despite well-designed scare shots, the laborious telling of this elaborate ghost story ultimately fizzles under the weight of too much effort."
0,"The movie bumps along from low-grade scare to scare, and it's not lousy, mainly because Virginia Madsen prevents it from being so."
1,"It was with considerable surprise that I found myself flinching more than once while watching Peter Cornwell's ghost story, The Haunting in Connecticut."
0,"As a piece of storytelling, The Haunting In Connecticut is pretty lazy. As a horror movie, it's lazier still, bringing out every annoying shock-cut and disorienting sound-design trick of the last decade."
0,The Haunting in Connecticut is another movie based on a supposedly true paranormal occurrence -- perhaps you haven't entirely forgotten 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose or An American Haunting from 2006.
0,Good performances and an eerie atmosphere can't save the flick: I'd wait for the DVD.
0,"The combination of emotional impact and brutal imagery is initially potent, but the second half of the movie wallows in occult cheese that's hard to swallow."
0,"If the movie has a flaw, it's too many surprises."
0,Madsen barely emotes during the ensuing flood of hokey scare tactics.
0,"Haunting suffers for its need to be sold as a straight-up horror film, and the fact it has been seemingly retrofitted as such."
0,Connecticut: not very haunty.
0,"Eventually the whole thing ends as these B-movies usually do -- with false denouements, sudden conflagrations and forced happy endings that leave the audience groaning and prematurely grabbing for their coats."
0,[W]hite people haven't learned much in the quarter-century since Eddie Murphy's classic disquisition on The Amityville Horror.
0,"Ho-hum, one more slapped-together exercise in pre-fab horror."
0,"It's boring to pick apart a movie's inconsistencies one by one, but The Haunting in Connecticut contains so many insults to the audience's intelligence, it doesn't offer much choice."
0,It's just such a thoroughly typical ghost story.
0,It loses steam once the wraiths become fully visible: they're just not scary enough.
0,"Creaking floorboards, slamming doors, flickering lights -- you've seen it all before, and it's all here again."
1,Director Peter Cornwell and writers Adam Simon and Tim Metcalfe set up their version of the Connecticut haunting with remarkable efficiency and credible atmospherics.
0,"Gives you the creeps, the giggles and the groans in almost equal measure."

1,Haunted-house movies would be nothing without the odd frisson of scepticism. This is the best in quite a while.

1,Billy the Kid is a heartbreaking v챕rit챕 documentary by Jennifer Venditti about a misfit Maine teenager -- a film that makes you think about (and question) what fitting in really entails.
1,"I have seen more than 25 documentaries this year, and after a while they all start to run together, both structurally and thematically. Billy the Kid is utterly original in both respects."
1,The documentary Billy the Kid presents the world according to a troubled teenager in Maine.
1,There's something to be said for Venditti's ability to build the kind of trust with a subject necessary to get full participation.
1,I don't imagine any adult could watch Billy the Kid without sharp pangs of recognition; everyone who passes through the crucible of teenage-ness feels at least momentarily as awkward as Billy.
1,"Nobody ever said growing up a small-town geek was easy. I know from personal experience, and so does Billy Price, the subject of director Jennifer Venditti's affecting documentary Billy the Kid."
1,"Billy the Kid, a movie that's as interesting as it is dewy-eyed, may be the rare snapshot of an adolescent 'outcast' who is really the guy made for fame, with a built-in radar for how to present himself in front of the camera."
1,"Billy's resilience, though, is nothing short of amazing. Not to mention part of growing up."
1,The best documentaries take you places you don't normally have access to.

1,"Polson maintains an unsettling tension throughout the narrative, building his slow-burn thriller to a climax that deliberately runs counter to the in-your-face genre principles of which he proved such a master with his first two thriller outings."
0,"Cormier himself called Tenderness a tough book written in ""a minor key"" and perhaps Polson was inspired by the description. But if so, he doesn't come close."
0,"Crowe's lumbering presence is a relief from all the gothic heaviness, but director John Polson's elliptical storytelling style quickly becomes an irritant."
0,"A movie undone by its formulaic plot conventions, and its need to give its star more screen time than his characters merits."
0,"Crowe, who spends the movie trudging along ... and waxing lyrical about pain and pleasure, must be hoping no one sees this mawkish blunder. He will probably get his wish."
1,"Director Ron Howard and his crew have worked hard to make Professor Robert Langdon's return a thrilling, faster-paced walk in the park."
0,The streets of Rome haven't run this red since the Inquisition.
0,"Its twists, turns and revelations are just as ridiculous as those in the first film -- perhaps even more so -- and it breezes through arcane details with just as much dizzying speed."
1,"Angels & Demons barrels along with a confidence -- and, more fundamentally, a pulse -- missing from director Ron Howard's first encounter with the best-selling novels of Dan Brown."
1,Ron Howard and sheer stupidity go well together.
1,"It's doesn't quite pay off, but Angels & Demons does a much better job of balancing the blasphemy and blood, heresy and heroics that were Brown's ticket to eternal wealth if not eternal life."
1,"Credit where it's due: Director Ron Howard, also back from Da Vinci, keeps things moving fast enough -- the clock is ticking, after all -- that you don't linger over the implausibility of the story."
1,"The movie clips along, tricked out with state-of-the-art hardware and a hotter, brighter partner for Hanks."
0,"An odd kind of a slog that manages to keep you partially engaged, even at its most esoteric or absurd, despite an endlessly excitable choir and Hans Zimmer's pitiless score."
0,"Angels & Demons is better, though not by much, than 2006's Da Vinci Code. The story, however, is less interesting and even more far-fetched."
0,"Like its predecessor, Angels & Demons manages the miraculous feat of seeming to plod while racing at breakneck speed, the tempo set by Hans Zimmer's blusterous score."
0,"If nothing else, Angels & Demons proves that, as McGuffins go, a cylinder of antimatter is more fun than the Holy Grail."
1,"Without pretensions to profundity, the movie can be enjoyed for the hell-raising hooey it is."
0,This movie takes preposterousness to new levels; there are times when the proceedings become so ludicrous that one is tempted to laugh aloud at the sheer audacity of the plotting.
1,"Angels & Demons slips away pretty quickly after you've watched it, in the way of most blockbuster movies, but it's diverting enough while it lasts."
0,"Ultimately, the film tries so hard to strike a balance that it ends up standing stock-still."
0,"Nail-biting, God-fearing and unfolding at a breakneck pace -- a little like The Da Vinci Code on celestial speed -- ultimately everything wilts under the weight of the complicated story lines of its many saints and sinners."
0,"It's too lurid, too long. Too much is telegraphed."
0,"Though complete redemption of Brown's fiction may not be possible, Howard's new film at least represents an upgrade from a mortal to a venal movie sin."
0,"The result is dizzying enough to make you think you're entertained, although the moment you stop to think about Angels & Demons for even a second, the movie becomes ridiculous and preposterous enough to be laughed off the screen."
0,Howard simply isn't as good a filmmaker as Brown is a blissfully terrible writer.
0,"At half the length, and with half of Hanks' sneering pretension, this would make a pretty terrific action film. Anyone up for just plain Demons?"
0,"Howard's fluid camera movement, Salvatore Totino's old master-ly cinematography, and the Gregorian rants of Hans Zimmer's score cannot redeem the Hardy Boys plotting of Dan Brown's source material."
1,"You won't remember many of the stops after the movie ends, but at least you'll enjoy the ride."
0,"Angels & Demons, without being particularly good, is nonetheless far less hysterical than The Da Vinci Code."
1,A movie that's more streamlined and action-packed than the original.
0,"The problem here, as in The Da Vinci Code, is that the puzzles don't invite the viewers' involvement."
1,"This kind of film requires us to be very forgiving, and if we are, it promises to entertain. Angels & Demons succeeds."
1,"As transparent as this device is, Angels has elemental satisfactions in its blend of movie genre that could appeal to wide segments of the audience."
1,"Angels and Demons is an OK action film, but only the humorless will find it heretical -- or educational."
1,"Angels & Demons has some exciting sequences, a spectacular ending with a terrific twist and a grounding in the debate about science versus religion that could hardly be more timely."
1,"Angels and Demons is a truly handsome production, seamlessly mixing real locations with beautifully detailed sets. There are a few good performances here, and some thrills. Yet there's a flatness to the plotting."
0,"Ron Howard's follow-up to the stiff, stately 2006 The Da Vinci Code, might have been classy, entertaining junk -- if only it were entertaining."
0,"A future camp classic. Where Howard wants us to make the sign of the cross, we're slapping high fives."
0,"[T]he film does not conclude with Langdon being elected Pope himself, but, watching the spiraling inanities of the last 20 minutes, one might be forgiven for thinking it would be the next logical step."
0,"Howard seems to count on audience goodwill toward Hanks carrying over to Langdon, filling in the hero's many blanks."
0,"[It's] not anti-Catholic. It is, however, anti-exciting, anti-sense and anti-involving."
0,What the movie is supposed to accomplish -- laying out a fairly complex mystery in a way that creates suspense -- is precisely what it doesn't do.
0,"Presumably in response to criticism that The Da Vinci Code was static and talky, director Ron Howard has made Angels & Demons frantic %u2014 and, well, talky"
0,"Saying that Angels & Demons is a lot better than its predecessor, The Da Vinci Code, is like saying that this swine flu outbreak isn't nearly as bad as the last."
0,"The re-creation of St Peter's and the Sistine Chapel on the Hollywood backlot is a production achievement, yet the movie's about as exciting as looking over someone's shoulder while they finish a crossword."
0,"This graceless and overwrought piece of storytelling will probably earn a Pope's ransom at the box office, despite its many flaws."
0,"If the film is never quite as inert as The Da Vinci Code, I hesitate to call this a thriller. It's big, bombastic and glossy - but it is also stiff and sometimes ludicrous."
0,"What pleasures there are in Brown's orgy of Catholic intrigue could only be called accidental, and tend towards the guilty - you may want to take a whip."
1,"So the film isn't entirely without faults, and those of the faith will pick many holes in it. But I was entertained, and I may even read the book."
1,"[It] not only doesn't suck, it is positively enjoyable. And fun."
1,"Ron Howard directs a pell-mell script (David Koepp, Akiva Goldman) with more agility than he showed in Code. Though the story suffers intermittent daftness."
0,"Angels and Demons proves every bit as swollen and portentous as The Da Vinci Code. It is, however, nine minutes shorter than that film, so there's something to be grateful for."
0,"Angels & Demons, the fantastic ongoing saga of Brownism might make us feel short of breath in the company of something that is beyond belief. That's Dan Brown I'm talking about."
1,"A slick, speedy thriller that cuts between mystery and murder at an agreeable enough tempo to make two hours go by."
1,"It's a noisy ride and what you're looking at is pure hokum but for non-believers like me, there's more fun to be had from this express tour of Brown's obsessions than there was in The Da Vinci Code's ponderous progress."
0,This is not a good movie.
0,"We're left to wonder, who in the Vatican can really be trusted? And also, will Ron Howard continue to make movies about a character who comes alive on the page, but sputters on the big screen?"
0,"If these movies made any damned sense, the public response might be no more than a yawn."
0,"At one point Hanks can be glimpsed gasping for air, mid-endless-sentence. Has there ever been a flatter movie character played by a more innately likable star?"
0,Why are quality pros like Howard and Hanks involved in this enterprise? Do they need the money? Angels and Demons is sure to make plenty. But their artistic souls will do hard time in purgatory for it.

1,The film certainly plays well enough as a melodrama-cum-revenge thriller.
0,Jackson undermines solid work from a good cast with show-offy celestial evocations that severely disrupt the emotional connections with the characters.
0,"So infuriatingly coy, and so desperate to preserve the modesty of its soulful victim that it amounts to an ongoing clean-up operation."
1,When else has the obscenity of child murder been the cause of such gravity and grace?
0,"[Ronan] captures the uncertainty and intensity of thwarted teenage passions perfectly but, set against the artifice and the manipulative tendencies of the story, her admirable performance is rather swamped."
0,The real let-down is its heavy reliance on overblown special-effects sequences to represent the celestial limbo.
0,"How do you literalize heaven? It's a problem moviemakers have struggled with forever, and Jackson hasn't solved it."
0,The Lovely Bones has been fashioned as a holiday family movie about murder and grief; it's a thoroughly queasy experience.
0,"Part Disney's Alice in Wonderland, part Fritz Lang's M, the movie is horrific yet cloying, alternately distended and abrupt, sometimes poignant and often ridiculous."
1,"The New Zealand director's trademark recipe of fantasy, realism and computerized visual effects turns The Lovely Bones into a thrilling adventure."
1,"The repulsive yet redemptive story is harrowing, but director Peter Jackson's visions of heaven feel like a My Little Pony version of Lord of the Rings."
0,"In Jackson's simplified, sweetened, and ?쭯GI-besotted telling, The Lovely Bones is a sad-but-hopeful, dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens."
0,Jackson crafts lovely but ineffectual dreamscapes of the afterlife that eviscerate much of the human side of the story.
1,"Loved the book by Alice Sebold. Admired the bold effort by Peter Jackson, even if the otherwordly scenes sometimes miss the mark."
0,"Jackson's film takes us on a journey of loveliness, but without the hard, stark strength of bone beneath it to give it the direction and purpose Sebold used to drive her story into the heart."
0,"For all its successes, Bones remains more crafted than sincere, more meant to look achingly pretty on the screen than to resonate in the heart."
0,"The movie strikes clashing tones, veering from lightheartedness to heavy-handedness."
0,"Scene by scene, the movie alternates between prurient violence and sentimental uplift."
0,"With his garish, pointless and downright inept rendering of Alice Sebold's 2002 novel, The Lovely Bones, Peter Jackson has hit a new low in the annals of movie adaptations."
1,A victim obsessed with the lives that go on without her is at the center of The Lovely Bones.
0,"Color me relieved. There is no need to fear death, even the most horrifying kind of murder. Because the afterlife is exactly like the album cover for a 1970s progressive-rock band."
1,"The novel never flinched, the movie does. But Jackson, who builds jolting suspense when Susie's sister enters the killer's lair, is drawn to a spiritual dimension."
0,"The result is dumbfounding and ludicrous in equal measure, a too-muchness that makes the excesses of What Dreams May Come seem downright spartan."
0,"Jackson is too enamored with the idea of mixing heaven and the heebie-jeebies, so he's made the skeevy equivalent of a Mitch Albom book with some pulp fiction pressed between its covers."
0,Everything that's good is undermined by an overemphasis on one part of the story that is essential but has been allowed to overflow its boundaries.
1,"It is unusual, emotionally satisfying and, in an echo of his early exploitation splatterfests, darkly funny."
1,"Peter Jackson has successfully filmed hobbits in middle earth and aliens in South Africa, but struggles to combine the visuals of a teenage girl in limbo with the ordeals of a family in hell."
1,Jackson takes a more scenic route. It looks like a New Zealand tourist poster animated with CGI and touched up with borrowings from Dali and Magritte.
0,"Despite significant cuts and instances of condensation, the plot's skeleton tracks well with Sebold's book, but therein lies the roots of a problem: the movie features wild swings in tone and fails to draw the viewer into the story."
0,It's a competently made movie -- in Jackson's hands it could hardly be anything but -- yet rarely a moving one.
0,"Jackson overwhelms the thoughtful, introspective nature of the material with whistles and bells -- heavenly effects that scream ""overkill."""
0,"The Lovely Bones is difficult viewing, a meticulously crafted experiment that, it turns out, wasn't worth it."
0,"There was no reason to make this book into a film -- and many reasons not to -- so you have to admire Peter Jackson for trying. Unfortunately, he's the wrong director for the job."
0,"The miscalculation on almost every level is perversely thorough. It's as if the filmmaker, faced with an endless series of daunting creative choices, proudly took the wrong road each and every time."
0,"Tonally, visually, conceptually, The Lovely Bones is all wrong."
1,Peter Jackson's adaptation of Alice Sebold's best-selling novel hovers just this side of Ghost Whisperer kitsch but remains compulsively watchable.
1,"So much about The Lovely Bones is so skillfully orchestrated, from the chillingly methodical villainy to the thrillingly paced manhunt, we can accept that we're in the hands of a higher power."
0,Sometimes a major director becomes enthralled with the cinematic prospects of material for which he is not ideally suited.
0,A movie that has been tinkered and fussed with until there is no spontaneity left -- no warmth or life or messiness.
0,"The Lovely Bones is a deplorable film with this message: If you're a 14-year-old girl who has been brutally raped and murdered by a serial killer, you have a lot to look forward to."
0,"Some books should stay between their covers, and The Lovely Bones may well be one of them."
1,"Understand, the film still has power, just not as much as it should."
1,The movie is often wise.
1,"This is a distractingly busy movie, so in love with its own considerable craft that it can't stay still long enough for anything to settle in."
0,"Jackson's grand, computer-generated vision of Susie's Dali-like ""in between,"" while occasionally gorgeous, leaves the viewer feeling stuck between two worlds, too. The story suffers."
0,"Most often, Jackson's magical other world resembles the land of Oz on steroids or, in one scene, a feminine hygiene ad."
0,"Tone is the first thing sacrificed in this shapeless, overlong, mawkishly muddled pop-up illustration of a movie."
0,"Alice Sebold's evocative best seller proves to be more unfilmable than Tolkien's sprawling fantasy trilogy - a disappointment, yet it's impossible for anyone to do it better"
0,"Under the hammy direction of Peter Jackson The Lovely Bones has lost its poetic bone structure. What was a complex, quirky novel has been turned into a movie mishmash of Lord of the Rings and High School Musical, with a serial killer thrown in."
0,"Instead of a compelling nightmare, he has created a bland, girly-sparkly dream."
0,"It's an extraordinary folly. A turkey, a pig's ear, a mad cow of a film. Its treatment of bereavement and familial grief is crazier than anything Lars Von Trier came up with in Antichrist."
0,"The delicacy and finely-wrought characterisation of Alice Sebold's novel has been removed in favour of a beyond-the-grave whodunit, subtlety be damned."
0,"Jackson seems more at home in the afterlife than in this one, rendering this off-kilter project creepy and pretentious."
0,"Jackson's version achieves a different, less palatable kind of novelty. It is a ""heart-warming"" film about murder."
0,"It is the kind of film that falls over itself trying to dazzle us, and makes an unholy mess of the vital workaday stuff. It is silly, tedious, tasteless and utterly false."
0,"The imagery kills the fear. In a film which is essentially about a child serial killer, the constant blossoming of visual possibility leaves the reality of what happened to Susie both hidden and cold."

1,"What could have been a standard-issue coming-out, coming-of-age movie develops a remarkable intimacy."
0,Well-acted but rife with clich.
0,"Shelter is a gay movie like other American gay movies. Boy meets boy. Boy comes out. Boys fight opposition. Opposition caves. If there's life beyond the closet, too few movies know it exists."
1,"Shelter rises very high indeed, thanks to a superb performance by Trevor Wright in the lead role, a strong supporting cast, very good cinematography and, most of all, emotional authenticity."
1,"A confused young artist is torn between his family and his future in Shelter, a sensitive romantic drama from the writer and director Jonah Markowitz."
1,"Shelter may only be shoreline deep, and its ending fanciful, but the film captures the beauty, thrill and ache of young love and extracts a casual joy out of the process."
0,"A coming-out, coming-of-age movie that is mediocre and very well-intentioned."
1,Pic succeeds to an impressive degree.
1,I really enjoyed this film.
1,"A sweet, tender, slightly satirical slice of the showbiz life."
0,"The cast is speckled with lively souls like Steve Zahn and Griffin Dunne, but the only person who wakes the movie from its slumbers is Emily Blunt."
0,"Despite the presence of some A-list performers, The Great Buck Howard can't shake the feeling that it's more on the level of made-for-TV than something destined for theatrical greatness."
1,"The Great Buck Howard is in love with kitsch, the backwaters of showbiz, and true magic. It's ?쮉 wee charmer that left me enchanted."
0,"Like the has-been it celebrates, this gentle comedy wears out its welcome by embracing mediocrity."
1,"It sidesteps ultra-saccharine territory, emerging as sweetly nostalgic and gently satiric, if lightweight, entertainment."
1,"When an actor finds the perfect role, a rare sort of magic happens. And you can find it onscreen right now, in The Great Buck Howard."
1,"Malkovich, mixing the magician shtick with a dogged resiliency, a dab of pathos, and more than a bit of mystery (did he really just hypnotize 300 people?), is simply a joy to watch."
0,"Malkovich refuses to make his arrogant, prickly has-been remotely likeable, but the movie isn't as uncompromising as his performance, which gets drowned in a sea of schmaltz."
0,It's the movie equivalent of handing us a business card.
1,The Great Buck Howard is cheekily observant about celebrity self-importance while still conveying Buck's commitment to entertaining regular folks.
1,The film is funny and perceptive in the way it shows the humiliations for a man with Buck's tender vanity.
1,"Just as in Burn After Reading, the craftsman's pursuit of character, warts and vulnerability intact, is adamant. He makes it hard to pass up this Buck."
0,"Malkovich keeps Buck an enigma -- part fool, part unheralded genius -- and if the film moves in expected ways it also hits some subtle grace notes."
0,What Malkovich really needs are actors opposite him with a few more tricks up their sleeve.
1,"The film is a small-scale charmer that provides a tailor-made role for Malkovich, who is always fun to watch."
1,"[Director] McGinly, working with a modest budget, balances the film's sense of mockery with its more somber moments and doesn't allow the story's considerable nostalgia and sentimentality to overwhelm it."
0,"Under the direction of, say, Alexander Payne or David O. Russell, Malkovich might have flourished in a deeper, darker, more madcap version of the film."
1,"Writer-director Sean McGinley based his title character on the Amazing Kreskin, and it provides a suitable mainstream vehicle for Malkovich's bruised aloofness."
1,The Great Buck Howard is an agreeable show business satire with a warm heart.
1,Any synopsis of The Great Buck Howard is going to make it sound more than a little like My Favorite Year. ... But that film had a compellingly poignant center.
1,"To their credit, Malkovich and McGinly never make sentimentality easy--when Buck's career starts picking up, the first thing he does is get a facelift."
1,"The movie, which was written and directed by Sean McGinly, is consistently good as long as it centers on Buck and his seriocomic travails."
0,The film feels painfully thin.
1,A modest snapshot of a performer.
1,A pleasant enough comedy in the My Favorite Year mold.
1,"This is not a rare movie, but it does have a warm red center. It's likable, and its appeal grows as it recovers from a shaky start and finds its footing."
0,"Malkovich's titular mentalist is the primary focus of attention%u2014and sadly the source of many of the film's unique problems. In a career of strange performances, Malkovich turns in a true curiosity here%u2014and maybe it's because he is not, for once,"

1,"Director Roger Donaldson keeps the suspense crackling. By the end, you'll want to know more about a heist that literally did shake the empire."
1,An engrossing if underwhelming period thriller.
1,"The tone is strangely erratic, aiming for the breezy high-jinks of Ealing comedy in the first half, then collapsing into dead-eyed sadism, then back to cheeky cockney chappies for a reasonably rousing climax."
0,"Tautly mounted, it all looks authentically old fashioned, and there are a few nuggets of amusing dialogue amid the occasional violence, sexual debauchery, political corruption and overall hedonistic atmosphere."
1,"In short, this is not a very distinguished film, but it does have a good enough plot to keep you watching and wondering what is the result of good research and what has been constructed by intelligent guesswork."
1,"As a spectacle of ingenious larceny, it's not up there with Rififi, or even Sexy Beast. But it's not bad, either."
0,"While other countries do state-of-the-art schadenfreude, we are stuck in the steam age. We feed coal into the engines of old-fashioned heist thrillers."
0,Cinema by numbers.
1,"Roger Donaldson, the Australian-born director who, in recent years, has become the kind of solid pro that Hollywood developed in the nineteen-thirties and forties, has made a straightforward, tight-knit crime thriller."
1,Terrific film. Quite a surprise.
0,This sluggishly paced caper flick fails to score.
1,"It's all sufficiently brisk and engaging as it's going on, and afterward you certainly won't feel ripped off. But you won't feel any differently, either."
1,"The Bank Job is smart, well-paced, exciting entertainment for adults -- something that is more of a rarity than it should be."
1,"The Bank Job shapes up as one of the liveliest entertainments of the year and, in its twisted way, a genuine feel-good movie."
1,The story is filled with new dimensions that separate it from a run-of-the-mill heist flick.
1,Fascinating.
0,The Bank Job would probably go down a little easier if there weren't so much potential for seizing on a ripe cultural moment. Some stories are too good for mediocrity.
1,The Bank Job is fun to watch while both the heist and its often bloody consequences unravel in front of you.
1,What makes director Roger Donaldson's movie greater than zany heist fare is that this particular robbery really happened and that this episode illuminated an almost moral clash between the haves and the have-nots of Great Britain.
1,"Watching The Bank Job, you buy the heist, and you also buy the entertaining layer cake of British society -- the black radicals, smut lords, and MI5 agents who treat cops like janitors, all fighting for their piece of the action."
1,Any heist film containing the line 'I will not be lectured by the porn king of Soho!' is on the right track.
1,"It gets right the twists, the humor, the tension, the sexiness and, yes, the violence of a really fun, taut British thriller."
1,The Bank Job is a solidly built and entertaining Brit B-movie about a heist that goes wrong. And right.
0,It's something new for heist pictures: a movie that can't even rip off its predecessor with any panache.
1,"The Bank Job is nothing more than an efficient time-killer with the added bonus of being based on a real misadventure. But, unlike its benighted cast of characters, it gets the job done without a hitch."
1,"A tight, classic-feeling film about losers banding together for one big score, then scrambling furiously as they realize they're in over their heads. It's fast, nifty, sharp and sweet."
1,"Thanks to the twin pens of screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, what a jam-packed and misanthropic fiction this is."
1,Longtime screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have woven a masterful narrative full of odd twists and dark humor from which Australian director Roger Donaldson and a prime cast mine plum characters and a tight plot to satisfying effect.
1,"With its cockneys and coppers and the caper that comes a cropper, the movie is fully engaging on several levels."
1,The workmanlike title The Bank Job is a nice fit for this wham-bam caper flick.
1,"There's nothing here as lively as In Bruges or as arty as the recent London to Brighton. But if we are in a mini-renaissance of U.K. thrillers, even the so-so The Bank Job is a good reminder of what made them work to begin with."
1,"All in all, the film written by Dick Clement and Ian LaFrenais feels both absolutely of the 1970s and absolutely fresh."
1,"You need the right actors to make a movie as intelligent and as engaging as this one is, and [director] Donaldson knows how to make each character in this rather complex ensemble seem whole and distinct."
1,"The movie plunges into this rank, choppy water and churns through it with a busily whirring story line and clear sense of purpose. The ride becomes its own satisfying reward, complete with the bumps and lurches along the way."
0,No worse than its generic title. And no better.
1,"Blending suspense, humor, period detail, interesting characters and bringing together a complex plot in an immensely satisfying way, [director Roger] Donaldson really pulled one off this time."
1,"The Bank Job engages us fully with a tale that's well-fashioned more than anything else, a fascinating study of morality at several levels of English society, and of honor, or the lack of it, among implausibly likable thieves."
1,"Well-paced, smartly told and unpretentious, this solid British heist thriller also has moments of invention and imagination"
1,"This may be just another bank job, like many you've seen before, but here's the payoff: it's a heist that actually looks real for once."

1,"At 38, Kevin Smith is still making foul-mouthed adolescent comedies, but a bit of adult sweetness and romance now creeps in."
1,"The bluntly titled Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a cheerfully vulgar love story or a sweet-hearted sex farce, however you want to look at it."
1,The funniest movie of Smith's I've seen since Clerks. It's When Harry Did Sally.
0,It's written and directed by Kevin Smith -- and hats off to him for being savvy enough to go for a piece of the Apatow action! Too bad he doesn't rise to the occasion.
0,"Of course, what Zack and Miri actually make -- and what Rogen and Banks power their way through with a cherubic energy above and beyond the call of duty for a premise so inconsequential and puerile -- is another Kevin Smith comedy."
1,"Audiences know what to expect from Smith, and he does not disappoint."
1,"Rogen and Banks make an extremely likable comic pair, even though they're an unlikely romantic match (or perhaps because of it)."
1,It's hard to imagine this film succeeding on any level without Mr. Rogen and Ms. Banks as the leads.
0,"Nothing about Zack and Miri feels terribly fresh, much less transgressive."
1,"Seth Rogen specializes in comedies where sex comes before love, a practicality that happens far more often on earth than in shiny, starry meet-cute romances."
0,It's a funny concept whose execution does not live up to its potential.
1,"At 38, the grand old man of raunch talk has figured out how to make a movie that's sweet, funny and (a little) sexy."
1,"Rogen and Banks, both terrific, bring out the sweet and spicy best in each other."
1,It's all vintage Smith -- if you can say that about a 38-year-old -- just pushed a little further.
1,"Smith ties the love story to the idea that his leads pull out of their life slump by embracing their creative, industrious sides."
0,This one's for the Smith cultists.
0,It's a slow-footed film that confirms that Smith may never be able to lift his game to that 40 Year Old Virgin level of heart and romance. He's just too juvenile to pull it off.
1,There's a warm Boogie Nights-style vibe to the little family of oddballs Zack and Miri recruit to help them.
1,Will this movie offend you? Somehow Kevin Smith's very excesses defuse the material.
0,"If this film were about teenagers, it might seem less like an outrageous comedy and more like a mundane slice of life."
1,"Zack and Miri ends up as an interesting hybrid: a sweet, feel-good comedy that makes you feel like you need a shower after you've watched it."
0,"That combination of raunch and heart isn't impossible to achieve -- at his best, Apatow can pull it off -- but it requires a nimbler pen and a sweeter soul than Kevin Smith brings to this movie."
1,Everyone on screen seems to be having so much fun.
0,"Seth Rogen is totally out of control. He's been marvelously funny in the past, and will be again, but get that party animal back in his cage."
0,Zack and Miri isn't very funny. Laugh-out-loud bits here are as rare as real breasts in an adult film.
1,"The audience where I watched the movie laughed so hard that we all probably missed a third of the lines, and it was still one of the funnier movies I've seen this year."
0,"The jokes are forced, almost mechanical, in their crudeness. They're so carefully placed that they feel a little precious rather than spontaneous, which ends up defying that impulsive, animal thing inside us."
0,"The mood lurches around a bit, and the film itself feels a bit diluted -- as if Kevin Smith were doing Judd Apatow doing Kevin Smith. And Smith, and his fans, are far too original to settle for that for long."
0,"Without the wit, raunchiness tends to feel uncomfortably forced. And the moments when Z&M works are, almost without exception, the ones that are more sweet than shocking. All the rest, frankly, feel like Apatow Lite."
1,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno is crude and raunchy, but it's also a great date movie. See it with someone you love -- and want to grope."
0,"Despite all the waggish raunch-talk, it's just not especially funny. And despite all the agile intercourse (originally rated NC-17), it's frankly kind of a bore."
0,"There may not be a special movie rating for this kind of coyness, but it definitely feels like emotional porn."
1,"There are laughs. Big, loud laughs. Laughs of self-recognition, laughs at social duplicity, laughs at prejudices of all types. Lots of laughs about the most basic of human functions. And many, many laughs at our own inhibitions."
1,"[Rogen's] funny, it works."
1,"While I wouldn't call the role of cheery, foul-mouthed Miri nuanced, Banks and Rogen click in a way that Rogen and Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up did not."
1,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno, in spite of its lewdness, follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel."
0,"Other peoples' emotional intimacy can be downright embarrassing. Here, sadly, it's also boring."
0,"The adult film reenactments are fairly gross and explicit and, worse, humorless."
0,It's one thing for a movie to be dirty; it's another thing altogether for it to be plain sloppy.
0,"Kevin Smith turns out to be reverent after all: he wants to separate true love from mere copulating for money, but his story mixes romance and porn so inextricably that he seems confused, and the movie trips over its own conceits."
0,"Smith may have pioneered this kind of upfront sex chat, but the Apatow team refined it. 'Zack and Miri' feels uncomfortably like a gruesome game of filth-talk oneupmanship, and it's hard to care who comes out on top."
0,This is the most soppy and unsexy 18-certificate skin-flick ever made.
0,"This is a very ordinary comedy script, and the presence of Smith's trusty repertory players in minor roles makes this for fans only."
0,Or: Kevin Smith makes an icky and secretly conservative sex comedy.
1,"I won't spoil the twist by revealing it, though you may not want to spoil the film by sitting through it. My suggestion, not wholly frivolous: see the first hour, then go to the pub."
0,"Rogen does his man-child-slob shtick dependably, and Elizabeth Banks is a good sport as well as a decent comedian. One only wishes that the whole thing were funnier."
0,"If this is part of our comedy culture, there's definitely something wrong somewhere."
0,"There remain some scatological touches I am still trying to forget. It's all done with great glee, yet falls far short of being hilarious."
0,"A well-meaning, foul-mouthed misfire."
1,"All in all it's a modern-day, Kevin Smith fairytale: a big-screen bearing, perhaps, of his soul at its sincerest and wittiest, if not filthiest."
1,
0,Everything about the movie is as clunky and unimaginative as the title.
0,"While not horrifically bad, it's as mediocre a motion picture as you're likely to find in a multiplex this season."
0,"Over Her Dead Body may be the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen, although I hesitate to make such a resolute pronouncement about a movie that's so barely even there."
1,For what it is -- a romantic comedy about the rivalry between a jealous ghost and a flaky psychic for the love of a veterinarian -- Over Her Dead Body is not bad.
0,A harebrained rom-com diversion offering few laughs and little romance.
0,A one-eyelash-above-average supernatural rom-com.
0,What's really spooky is that even the weakest Desperate Housewives episode packs more heat than this tepid romantic comedy-fantasy.
0,"Writer-director Jeff Lowell could have gone many different ways with this idea -- the screwball comedy of Heaven Can Wait, say, or even the wistful, unabashed romanticism of Ghost -- but he takes the low road more often than not."
0,"None of it makes sense -- logically, emotionally or dramatically."
0,This stale comedy about a vengeful ghost would be depressing if it weren't so disposable.
0,The line is fine between cute and annoying.
1,"This is no career high, but it's impossible to actively dislike Rudd."
0,"Even the worst movies are capable of bending the laws of time. Still, there's something really special about the way Over Her Dead Body makes its 93 minutes seem more like nine hours."
0,You may remember Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. This is Bleh Spirit.
0,"The kindest context in which to put Over Her Dead Body, which was written and directed by Jeff Lowell, is that of a training film, a public display of people trying to master their craft. The best way to see it is not at all."
0,The tale [falls] short on imagination.
0,"Writer/director Jeff Lowell settles for a story that takes a little too long to tell, concocted situations a little too implausible to buy and repartee that occasionally hits the dartboard but never gets close to the bull's-eye."
0,The worst night at the movies in this young year.
0,"You can't even feel sorry for Henry, because anyone blind enough to want to marry Kate is clearly delusional and deserving of any misery that comes his way."
0,Unfortunately wit-deprived.
0,"For what is essentially a screwball comedy, Over Her Dead Body is surprisingly uninspired, a frothy concept that offers little satisfaction in the way of execution."
0,"The grating presence of Longoria Parker will be enough to ruin the movie for many, but she's just one of many shortcomings in this romantic comedy, which seriously lacks both romance and comedy."
0,An unsurprising entry in that hoary micro-genre of romantic comedies to feature a fresh-from-the-corpse disembodied spirit who just can't seem to get a move-on.
0,"A wan, sad-eyed romantic comedy."
1,This is a film that's completely happy being its silly little self. And if it produces some giggles along the way -- and it does -- it has done its job.
0,"Over Her Dead Body itself is a movie haunted by the annoying, humorless performance of Eva Longoria Parker."
0,"Over Her Dead Body, billed as a romantic com edy fantasy, is in reality a mystery: The Case of the Missing Jokes."
0,"Over Her Dead Body is to romantic comedy what Spam is to meat. But at least with Spam, you get cool packaging."
0,Consider for a moment how this movie might play if it took itself seriously. Would it be better than as a comedy? I suspect so.
0,"A comedy like this needs actors with crack timing, a script that's worthy of them and an overall spirit of effervescence. But save for Rudd's occasional displays of sarcasm, there's little here that raises a smile, never mind a chuckle."
0,
1,"Lowell has little to say about loss and love. But there's a talking parrot, and on some days, that's enough."
0,A desperately unfunny farce that doesn't need an audience so much as an exorcist.
0,[An] offense of a ghost comedy.
0,The film -- pinched from Ghost in every relevant particular -- is pretty moderate.

1,"Arguably the most innocuous pic of Eddie Murphy's career to date, Imagine That is an undemandingly pleasant, mildly amusing fantasy."
1,Eddie Murphy and young Yara Shahidi make a strong comic pair in this amusing family film.
1,It's based on a clever premise and it makes good use of Murphy's comic strengths.
0,"Murphy's goofy, bug-eyed hysterics seem played out and overly familiar."
0,"Imagine That is a benignly didactic kiddie movie that at once benefits from and gets buried under Eddie Murphy's skittery, overeager inflections."
0,This is another loathsome family comedy in which a busy father is made to feel like a horrible parent until he abandons earning money and conforms to his child's every whim.
0,"If memory serves, kiddies like whatever movie you drop them off at but, for the record, Drop Dead Fred remains the vastly superior film."
0,It's too bad there's little to distinguish this predictable tale from any other comedy about an overly busy father who finally connects with his child.
1,"Shahidi's and Murphy's scenes together have such warmth, tenderness, and joy that they elevate this cookie-cutter comedy into homemade fun."
0,"I laughed once during Imagine That's interminable 107 minutes, and the longer I watched Murphy's desperate, embarrassing attempts at provoking laughter, the worse I felt."
1,"The actor's scenes with movie daughter Shahidi have an undeniable sweetness, and Shahidi is adorable in a role that easily could have seemed manipulative."
1,"For the first time since The Nutty Professor, Eddie Murphy successfully mixes his adult and kid-film personas -- imagine that."
0,"Given his growing track record of odious kiddie fare, it's no surprise to see Eddie Murphy squandering his talents as another in a long line of movie dads who are too wrapped up in their jobs to pay attention to their kids."
0,Eddie Murphy in another mediocre family comedy? Imagine that.
1,A little more than what you'd expect.
0,Imagine That is amusing without ever being break-out funny.
0,Cutesy? My pain was acutesy as the entire plot yawned before me.
1,"Fortunately, the picture's not-so-secret weapon, star Eddie Murphy, gives this uneven effort a reason for being."
0,"Imagine That has a few nagging problems, none of which is Eddie Murphy's fault."
0,"Given the movie's early creative promise, the ending is disappointingly trite."
1,"If there were any doubts that Murphy can still be as boldly funny and charismatic in the flesh as he has been when providing the voice of Donkey in the Shrek franchise, Imagine That helps allay them."
0,"Unfortunately, Evan's transformation rings tinny. The music guides us to the appropriate moods (This is magical! This is goofy!), because Murphy's performance doesn't."
1,"Director Karey Kirkpatrick mines laughter from human fallibility, aided by a strong supporting cast that includes Martin Sheen as the boss and Thomas Haden Church as an office rival."
1,"Here's a summer movie that kids will laugh at and parents can take them to without worrying about sex, violence, language or projectile vomiting jokes."
1,"Murphy rises to every occasion, not only with the crisp wit that has long been his hallmark, but with restraint and tenderness that serve him well."
1,A movie that takes a major step toward reasserting Murphy's place as the comic heir not just to such obvious models as Richard Pryor but to Groucho Marx.
1,This is a fairly likable family comedy.
0,"[A] misguided, poorly executed family disaster."
0,"Murphy at least tries to stay in character rather than overdoing the silly voices and physical knockabout, but maybe the material was so blah that he felt it wasn't worth the effort."
0,You're left with the feeling that the film-makers don't see a conflict between the profit motive and paternal love.
0,"There really isn't a spark of genuine humour or life in the entire thing, and the movie grinds its way to a syrupy finale."
0,"How would it be if Eddie Murphy quit making trashy, ingratiating comedies and grew up? Imagine that."
0,It's anodyne stuff and not funny enough.
0,"Murphy struggles to find work in other genres, but given the way he indulges himself with funny faces and voices, it's equally possible that he genuinely likes acting alongside children."
1,This lower-key effort offers up a winning mix of sharp comedy and touching bits that keeps the laughter -- a few tears -- flowing.
1,"Smartly supernatural, and featuring sensational performances by Ricky Gervais and Tea Leoni, Ghost Town is a Topper for our times."
1,Who knew that Ricky Gervais could play such a likable leading man?
1,"Ghost Town is diverting enough, but it's also the kind of high-concept studio concoction Ricky Gervais might have ridiculed in his great backstage-showbiz sitcom Extras."
0,Ghost Town's unwillingness to escape from a safe orbit keeps the movie trapped in mediocrity.
0,It takes a good while for Ricky Gervais to warm up in Ghost Town; it takes even longer for the audience to warm up to Ricky Gervais.
1,"The fall movie season achieves comic liftoff thanks to Ricky Gervais, a master of deadpan hilarity playing a dentist who sees dead people."
0,"Ostensibly a comedy, but one in which the (normally) brilliantly funny Ricky Gervais is more dull than he is droll, Ghost Town takes a familiar formula and goes nowhere with it."
1,"Pretty much everything about this afterlife comedy is straight-from-the-shelf save for Gervais, typically hilarious as a misanthrope who organizes his work and his private life so he doesn't have to talk to anyone."
1,"A delightful antidote to the comedic excesses of the season, Ghost Town is smart, sexy fun that should leave no doubt (if there was any) that Ricky Gervais is among the funniest men in film."
1,Ricky Gervais is a genius.
0,"You can only wander down this comic road for so long. Once you've run through a few sight gags, you have to go somewhere else with this old-fashioned, high-concept premise."
1,The last two lines of dialogue may be the best kicker I've heard in a movie this year.
1,"Funny but familiar, Koepp's comedy feels like a multiplex reincarnation -- we've seen this film before and back then we must have stepped on someone's toes"
1,"Naturally, Koepp makes it his business to redeem this unpleasant character and recast him as an acceptable stand-in for a romantic lead. But cynics should not despair; it's not a complete makeover."
1,"It's enlivened by the performance of Ricky Gervais as Bertram Pincus, a latter-day Scrooge for whom the living are no less annoying than the dead."
1,The best part of the movie is watching Gervais and Leoni delight in each other in scenes that burst with spontaneity and genuine warmth.
1,"Sure, it's a light comedy, but it effectively achieves what it sets out to do: amuse us and tug on our heartstrings. And best of all, it's written, directed and acted with intelligence and wit."
1,"Through it all there always shone this subtle, gleeful naughty schoolboy charm, not quite a full-on wink at the audience, but a tacit acknowledgement that sometimes even total jerks can exhibit an endearing charm."
1,"Fans of Gervais' awkward, caustic brand of humor should be pleased to see him in a big Hollywood movie that'll make him more of a household name."
1,"Ghost Town, a romantic comedy about the living and the dead coming to terms with each other, is both very funny and a bit of a tearjerker, with an on-the-money performance from Ricky Gervais and a nice feeling for New York in fall."
1,"Leoni and Gervais are wonderful together, as much for the ways in which they wobble against each other as for the ways they ultimately mesh."
1,"Although ghost hijinks are a very Hollywood way of dealing with the subject, the twists are executed superbly, right up to a climax that fits the David Mamet definition of what makes for a perfect ending: It is both surprising and inevitable."
1,Leave it to the unfailingly brilliant Gervais to breathe new life into an expiring genre.
1,"The painfully awkward, stubby Gervais as romantic lead is a funny enough concept, but the actor's ongoing banter with Kinnear is engaging, and their styles mesh entertainingly."
1,"Gervais is a master of the flustered broken thought, and Koepp takes full advantage in scenes that pit Pincus against a distracted doctor (a droll Kristen Wiig) and an imposingly large dog."
1,"The sharp comic timing and the offbeat chemistry of Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear and T횄 (C)a Leoni keep Ghost Town afloat."
1,"With lesser talent in front of the camera or a heavier hand behind it, the film might have crashed with a thud."
1,An innovative romantic comedy that is a mixture of British spice and American sugar.
1,"A friendly little piffle of a movie, Ghost Town nevertheless serves as a fine and funny introduction to Ricky Gervais for American audiences."
1,"It's not just that Gervais isn't your typical leading guy. He's not, and bravo. It's more that Koepp and Gervais hold tight to Bertram's unpleasantness and human clumsiness after most other films would have winked at their intentions."
1,"As Ghost Town reminds us, there's nothing wrong with formula filmmaking - as long as it's done with smarts and style. Indeed, formulaic doesn't have to be shorthand for lazy, obvious and uninspired."
1,"Gervais, a British actor whose work on television is legion, has at last found a leading role in a feature, and it's a good one."
1,"In this comedy by David Koepp, Gervais handles the big, crowd-pleasing gags with aplomb, though the only scenes that approach the edgy wit of his TV work are those he shares with fellow improvisers Aasif Mandvi and Kristen Wiig."
1,"Someone once said about W.C. Fields that he had the rare ability to despise amusingly. I can imagine no greater compliment than to say that Ricky Gervais seems, at his best, like a young Fields."
1,Gervais may be alone in remembering that this kind of movie is actually supposed to be funny.
1,"Enjoyable as it is to see Gervais trying (and often succeeding) to make something of the mediocre dialogue, it's not enough."
0,The film's premise is high-concept Hollywood at its creakiest.
1,"Ricky Gervais has carried off a proper, big Hollywood film; he may not be a natural, but he's done it without any hesitation or cultural cringe or apologetic foregrounding of his Britishness. He's cracked it."
1,"And yet the film, while it gets so many of the smaller details right, including an ending that puts the corny closures of so many Hollywood romances to shame, never quite rings true."
0,It is so nearly a ghost-themed remake of Groundhog Day that you can't help but think how much more interesting it would have been reworked by Harold Ramis with Bill Murray in the lead role.
1,"A warm, clever and often very funny film. On this showing, Gervais's assault on Hollywood looks winnable."
1,This makes it certainly one of the best American comedies of the year. Belly laughs are hard to come by but the smiles are consistent throughout.
1,"It is alternately tender, sad and smart. It's also very funny."
0,This just kind of fell flat.
1,"Writer-director David Koepp is almost too careful a craftsman for his own good, but Gervais and Leoni share a talent for throwing the audience off-balance..."
1,Ghost Town is both a surprise and a departure: it's genuinely funny and quietly original. It also shows what Gervais can do in the right role.

0,This low-rent frat house comedy is at once far more vulgar and decidedly less anarchic than its obvious inspiration and should flunk out of theaters before this year's crop of freshman students even finish unpacking their bags.
1,"Hardly superbad, but sorta OK."
0,"Film critics never come home stinking of their honest labor, but the nearest equivalent is covering something like College, which leaves its stain on one's very humanity."
0,"Insulting audiences with College and Disaster Movie on the same weekend threatens to split the lucrative, undiscriminating dumb-ass demographic."
0,"College tries to be a throwback to the teens-gone-wild films of the '80s, but now that teens can find far racier and far funnier fare than this on the Internet, these brainless movies have become obsolete."
0,Pity today's teenage audience. Their latest cinematic temptation is yet another tiresome fraternities-are-wild offering.
0,"In the battle for the hearts, minds and fat wallets of North American teens, College fights dirtier and sinks lower than most gross-out screen comedies."
0,"Friendly yet toothless, College musters little energy even as anarchic-party-movie nostalgia."
0,"Things never get better than the movie's poster, which features a kid with his head in a toilet. Incidentally, that image doubles, concisely, as apt film criticism."
0,"A raunchy comedy that plays like a Superbad without the smarts, the heart, the originality or the laughs."
0,"A tedious, by-the-numbers raunch-fest that exists strictly because it can."
0,I thought it was dreadful from start to finish.
0,"Not only would I not see this movie, I wouldn't see any movie playing in the same multiplex."
0,"If college were really like this, everyone would drop out and found Microsoft."
0,"Despite Ms. Jolie's hard work and Mr. Eastwood's scrupulous attention, [Jolie's] difficult, fairly one-dimensional character fails to take hold."
1,Clint Eastwood again brilliantly portrays the struggle of the outsider against a fraudulent system.
1,Emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed.
1,"Eastwood tells his haunting, sorrowful saga with such a sure, steady hand, only a very hardened cynic could fail to be moved."
0,"Changeling is beautifully wrought, but it has the abiding fault of righteously indignant filmmaking."
0,The way Eastwood shoves Jolie's suffering in our face is like a threat to the Academy: 'And the Oscar WILL go to ...?? She's a great actress. She doesn't need his domineering chivalry.
0,"The oldfangled deliberateness of Eastwood's style has backfired this time, only adding to the sense that though you may not have heard this particular story before, you already know everything that's coming."
0,"For a director who knows how to balance histrionics with a lack of sentimentality (see Mystic River), Eastwood is unable to modulate tone or performances here."
1,"Changeling is the real deal, as good as any film [Eastwood] has ever made, and 10 times more electrifying than most. It grabs you by the throat and never lets go."
0,"Mr. Eastwood, particularly, with his finely honed noirish instincts, should have sprinted more and cantered less."
0,Image trumps performance.
1,"Where much of Changeling works at once as a compelling mystery and an agonizing human drama, it starts to drift in a series of final scenes that finish the story while losing all sense of urgency."
0,"The Changeling doesn't invite the viewer to share in its heroine's disorientation, rage, and grief. Rather, it keeps us at a stately remove, presenting Christine's suffering as a kind of religious tableau."
0,"A film lacking in dramatic propulsion and actorly grace from Clint Eastwood, a director usually synonymous with both."
1,It has not a single unnecessary stylistic flourish. No contrived dramatics. No shocking stunts.
1,A mesmerizing film that burns in the memory.
0,"When it works best, Changeling is a feverish and bluntly effective parable of wronged innocence."
1,"Eastwood, working from a script by J. Michael Straczynski, tells a painful true story neatly and well, with one foot in rousing Hollywood melodrama and the other in a story that resists tidy resolution."
0,"Connections are missing or scrambled between the filmmaking and the period, between the co-stars, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich, and between the characters they play."
0,"While the neo-Gothic tale is inherently intriguing, the film should inspire strong emotion, but deliberate pacing and a contained sense of melodrama make it a surprisingly passive experience."
1,Changeling reminds us that the veneer of civilization is thin and made of quicksilver.
1,To see this film is to understand both how fragile and how essential our hopes for decency and truth are in a world that must be made to care about either one.
0,"[I]t is not enough to declare such improbable material historically accurate and leave it at that. It is Eastwood's burden to make it feel true... and in this, Changeling is a singular failure."
1,"The line between drama and melodrama is a fine one, and Clint Eastwood steps on both sides of it in his elegantly sad new film, Changeling."
1,Clint Eastwood is in the midst of one of cinema's most notable late growth spurts.
0,"Normally, Jolie is an actress capable of both intensity and subtlety, but her performance here is too amped up to register as anything more than a star turn. Did nobody notice that the real Angelina had been snatched?"
1,Changeling is another remarkable addition to Eastwood's directorial canon.
1,"The script is compelling, the direction confident, the production values professional. But it does not, in the end, feel real."
0,"Heavy-lifting, indeed. And, although Eastwood directs the narrative excess with his usual restraint, this time the results are mixed."
0,Changeling may be the most beautiful horror film ever made; it may also be the most boring.
1,"This incredible but true story marks the first time Eastwood's signature themes have found expression in a woman's experience, and the absence of any distracting machismo only heightens his sense of helpless rage."
0,It all just seems like window-dressing for Jolie's best-actress clip at the Oscars.
0,"Eastwood overcompensates for the movie's meandering with a succession of hysterics -- from men, women, and children."
1,This hothouse Changeling is freeze-dried.
0,How could a story as genuinely bizarre as this one seem so generic and rambling on the screen?
0,"With its many tonal shifts and dangling subplots, J. Michael Straczynski's sprawling script is a problem. Jolie's performance is another."
1,"If the film is too long and a little unwieldy in its later acts, the consummate craftsman in Eastwood glosses over that with detail and righteous rage."
1,"Changeling is a fine-enough movie. It's just that it's aware of the fact, and neither Eastwood nor Jolie ever lets the audience forget it."
0,"Clint Eastwood's Changeling falls into a common trap: by trying to do too much, it accomplishes too little."
1,This is one movie where the star really is the star. And delivers a performance of which any actress can be truly proud.
1,"If Changeling lacks the knockout power of, say, Million Dollar Baby, it proves that Eastwood continues to seek out stories that take him places he hasn't been before -- and the audience along with him."
0,"It is a misfire, a silly and borderline absurd story that cannot excuse its twists and turns with the simple 'a true story' declaration that opens the film."
0,"Eastwood, who has made fine movies in recent years, has got hold of a humdinger of a story. But he's too detached and lazy here."
1,It's a tough movie but also rewarding and inspiring: something of a quiet triumph.
1,"Changeling, like Letters from Iwo Jima before it, is a mature, thoughtful and sometimes brutal movie that casts a cold eye on the past while sending shivers through the present."
1,"What a bold, virile, operatic piece of film-making from this 78-year-old director. He is now well into a remarkable late period, and I sense we ain't seen nothing yet."
0,"Changeling fails because, despite its awful subject matter, it isn't very moving. Eastwood is too classical, too restrained a director to get inside his characters; they feel like well-costumed showroom dummies."
0,"The bigger the scene, as melodrama intensifies in this movie, the more its truth-based tale turns into grand guignol on the griddle."
1,"There are so many hints of a really good film lurking here that at times it feels as if the real article has been stolen away, an inferior knock-off put in its place. Heck, I'll settle for the one I've got."
1,Sometimes the grimness and grandeur gel; sometimes they just add up to pompous soaps.
1,"Eastwood is a director made for melodrama and this one proves a lot juicier than Gran Torino, with its dry, dogged sense of righteousness."
1,"There are moments when it seems as if it wants to be an inspirational story about a person who refuses to be beaten by a corrupt system -- but it doesn't, in the end, settle for the uplifting narrative."
0,"The semiserious comedy by director Sven Pape is in its own category, and unfortunately it's not always an interesting one."
0,"Seeing Hollywood as a business indifferent to dreamers with no cash flow isn't a revelation, but a given. If you're going to hold a mirror up to Tinseltown, at least try tilting it at a new angle."
0,"In trying to qualify as mordant satire, charming rom-com, uplifting buddy movie about underdogs trying to stick it to the man and the most meta story ever told, L.A. Twister sprains itself badly."
0,Pape and Saville-Read are so busy winking and chuckling over their own clever lampooning of Hollywood conventions that they forget to make the rest of us care.
1,Fun and entertaining but ends up lending an air of contrivance that keeps you from taking it too much to heart.
0,The barely watchable buddy comedy L.A. Twister is so sloppily put together it bungles its recycled movie-within-a-movie conceit.
1,"Resnais speculates on the utopian dream that life is infinitely perfectable, that human chaos, despair and horror can be spirited or educated out of existence. There are two stories, to correspond to each of these possibilities."
0,"The material manages at once to be both precious and dry, the staging is unprofitably claustrophobic, and the structure less ingenious than arbitrary."
0,It's more memorable for various isolated witticisms and images than it is as a coherent whole. And its flightier touches can be deadly.
1,"It could be that What Love Is is what lovers of either gender can like, thanks to equal parts misogynistic machismo and locker-room girl talk, all of it tied together with just a little bit of cozy romantic reality."
0,"Gooding is solid in the leading-man role. He has some of the best lines, and he's pretty much the only character you could stand to hang out with in real life."
0,"Now and then there is something strangely right about films this defiantly wrongheaded, but What Love Is never rises above the leaden, overbearing qualities of Callahan's dialogue and staging."
0,"What Love Is overflows with mind-numbing patter, bizarrely delivered with the arch formality of David Mamet, with the net effect of being yelled at for no reason."
0,Romantic comedies should never be this exhausting.
0,Someone tell writer-director Mars Callahan what a movie is.
0,"Shot on HD over the course of a week, calling-card pic looks and sounds like an Off Off Broadway play."
0,"Shrill, abrasive, cartoonishly over-the-top and badly titled."
0,"The film swirls about frantically in the effort to entertain, has a terrible Bob Fosse-like dance sequence and generally overstays its welcome."
0,"While intended as a comedy, there's not a scintilla of wit to be found here, let alone an honest-to-goodness laugh, and at over two hours, it goes way beyond a joke."
1,"A real oddity, shifting gear after the first half-hour from whimsical melodrama to morality-tale-cum-psychodrama."
1,Quite demented.
1,"If and when Bollywood does deliver a crossover hit, it's likely this film-maker will be behind it."
1,An enjoyably barmy movie that plunders from everything from Cabaret to Cocteau's Orphe.
0,"The film fails to entertain in the conventional sense of the term, and often feels like a documentary."
0,By the end frustrated viewers may want to kick Kashyap's butt.
0,It's never clear what it all means or even if it's supposed to mean anything. Music and silliness get the picture through to its circular ending.
1,"In a choice between traditional and safe and experimental and flawed, opt for the latter every time."
1,"Beautiful, grotesque, dancing always to their own rhythms."
0,"Harmony Korine's new film is a whimsical, lazily conceived tragicomedy about lookalike impersonators, and it is so pointless and irritating that after a while I literally found it difficult to breathe."
1,"Surreal, whimsical comedy about an island commune of impersonators."
0,"Too long, not nearly as funny as it hopes, and some plot elements (what's with the sheep?) are extraneous to the improvised mood."
0,"The film is pretty ramshackle, full of obvious group improvisations that fail to spark and an overdose of bathos."
0,"After Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy, the director Harmony Korine evinces a kind of integrity -- he tries never to entertain, and lo, he succeeds."
0,I will end with the faint praise of Mister Lonely as the least offensive of the works in the Korine canon.
1,"Movies tell the same stories over and over, but I know of only one that evokes mourned innocence in just a three-minute shot of a clown bike."
1,"This is undoubtedly a small movie, but it's also more than that: it's a small, imperfect world."
0,"Mister Lonely has its moments of wonder and beauty, but the film is obscure by design, and meant to appeal to those who favor the alternative canon of directing greats."
0,"Occasionally there is a striking image or a moment of wounded sweetness, but mainly the film provides ample proof that it's possible to be bizarre and boring at the same time."
1,"In this fairy-tale of arrested development, Korine has created his most mature movie yet."
1,"[Harmony] Korine hasn't released a feature film in nine years, and his new Mister Lonely is richer and sweeter than anything he's ever made."
0,"While it's full of arresting, indelible images, Mr. Lonely remains mostly on the level of abstraction. You get it but you don't always feel it."
1,"In its slightly comical, somewhat mordant, and completely ambient way, Mister Lonely wonders about the perils of idol worship, the way people can hand their entire selves over to a religion, be it Catholicism or celebrity."
1,"Harmony Korine's films thrive on uncertain ground. Exiting the theater, you're never more aware that ten people can sit next to each other but see ten different films."
1,A visually and conceptually mesmerizing and mystical movie.
0,Sporadically poetic but largely a chore to sit through.
0,"Korine's most lavishly produced pic to date begins as a sweet-tempered tale of social misfits-turned-celebrity impersonators, but falls short of its ambition to say something meaningful about the obsessive nature of celebrity culture."
0,"Like Francis Ford Coppola's Youth Without Youth, the film has overarching problems yet contains diamonds of clarity and inspiration that you won't find in any dozen movies. You'll have to mine for those diamonds, though."
1,"Korine falls so thoroughly in love with many of his images, including his opening shot, that he stretches them out in hypnotic slow motion."
0,"Korine has found an evocative subject, but he remains entirely too cavalier in this attitude towards narrative coherence."
1,"In contrast to the grimy and occasionally grotesque Gummo (1997) and Julien Donkey-Boy (1999), this drama has a more gentle, Felliniesque feel."
0,"The film doesn't work, and indeed seems to have no clear idea of what its job is, and yet (sigh) there is the temptation to forgive its trespasses simply because it is utterly, if pointlessly, original."
0,A movie that goes to extraordinary lengths to say ordinary things.

0,"Street cred can't save this pic, not even with Dennis Hopper and David Carradine cameos, and QT himself exec-producing and initiating the project."
0,"Thesps (even toplining helmer, who's a strapping 60 years old) have nothing to work with, though one hopes they had fun riding about the desert."
0,"For a grindhouse throwback that works, try Tarantino's Death Proof (the shorter version). That one delivered; Hell Ride gets a flat 10 minutes in and goes floop-floop-floop the rest of the way."
0,"Nostalgia is a poor foundation for any movie, and the film's visceral pleasures are too limited to effectively compensate for the lack of credible characters or a coherent storyline."
0,The main problem is Bishop's adamancy on playing the lead tough guy when he's got the face of a shoe salesman.
0,"[Director Larry Bishop] burdens his film with clumsy art-house ambitions that clash with its embrace of bikes, beer and booty. If any of this sounds amusing, be warned: it's not."
0,"The script, written by Bishop, barely makes sense. It lacks anything resembling wit, unless you think it amusing that these aging cyclists brag about needing their three B's -- bikes, beer and booty."
0,Does it count against you when you actually set out to make an awful movie? It should.
0,"A witless reprise of '60s and '70s biker movies written, directed by, and starring Larry Bishop."
0,"Where the biker films of the late '60s and early '70s offered edgy, amusingly cheesy thrills, this sputtering effort is as rusty as an unrestored Triumph Bonneville."
0,"The film gets the scummy patina right, all phony-Leone dusty trails, but while everybody on screen looks to be enjoying themselves, it is no fun to watch."
1,"The result is, predictably and enjoyably, old-fashioned macho mayhem with a post-modern twist. This movie knows it's ridiculous. Heck, it's proud to be ridiculous."
0,The whole thing feels like the sort of picture Tarantino would make if he weren't such an ingenious B-movie artist: a genre exercise that's more studious than entertaining.
0,"As cheesy as the American-International biker flicks of the 60s were, they had a raw vitality missing from this self-conscious tribute."
0,"The movie was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino. Shame on him. He intends it no doubt as another homage to grindhouse pictures, but I've seen a lot of them, and they were nowhere near this bad. Hell's Angels on Wheels, for example: pretty good."
0,
0,"It's a claustrophobic dud, full of ludicrously purple tough-guy dialogue and lip-smacking vamps in bikinis (how hot!), with so much monotonous hip violence there's scarcely room for anything else."
1,"Maybe only once every six months am I in the mood for jokey sadism, but this struck me as the right picture for the right time."
0,"The dialog is clever, nutty and syncopated, with a soundtrack -- of the ""C.C. Rider"" vein -- which ain't half-bad, either."
0,
0,"Where the film stumbles is the script, overcrowded with bits of business and scenes that lean heavily on the symbolic."
0,"[Director] Sarin was aiming for an epic and arrived at episodic. That might have been okay if the episodes weren't so partitioned from each other, the flashbacks failing to illuminate the present action."
1,"It is, however, watchable throughout as a document about the individual human tragedies that the advent of Partition threw up."
0,"If feeling alone were the benchmark of great art, Vic Sarin's film would be considerable, but the screenplay is desperately poor and the direction leaden."
1,"The film is breathless, big-canvased and scored for big emotions: a pavilion of the heart and senses threatened only when characters open a flap to let in anachronistic dialogue or the giveaways of cross-culture casting."
0,Dull historical epic set during the Indian massacres of 1947.
0,"But this is a film that lumbers under its epic ambitions and at nearly two hours long - with some awkward plotting to boot - scenes drag, grand and momentous, but crushing anything so fragile as human feelings."
1,It's the taboo and tender romance between Mistry and Kreuk that will shift the serious tickets.
0,The period reconstructions are impressive but the script and direction are a little pedestrian.
1,[Screenwriter] Poirier is a master at dialogue. His script crackles with sharp lines and he gives all his scenes a splendid comic undertow.
0,"It ends up less a dark comedy than a medium-gray one, the impact further muffled by its marinating in a tepid pool of generic soft-rock sounds."
0,"It's all action, no reaction. One minute they're miserable; 90 minutes later, aww better."
1,"The fun of Smart People, which was written by Mark Jude Poirier and directed by Noam Murro, is seeing Quaid bite, with darkly funny and misanthropic gusto, into the acrid soul of a man whose life has curdled."
0,"Those who find comfort in competently made but overly familiar stories may enjoy what Smart People have to offer. For me, it was too thin to truly satisfy."
0,"Novelist-turned-screenwriter Mark Poirier gives the capable, eclectic cast some real zingers to play with, but he also loads his script with some plot contrivances that are simply too hard to accept."
0,"One of those sadly dependent independent films, every bit as formulaic as any Hollywood blockbuster."
0,Memo to the Miramax marketing department: You might want to think about changing that title.
0,The overreaching script by novelist Mark Poirier is intermittently funny. One gets the sense that Poirier was aiming for Scrabulous dialogue but his movie is barely of Boggle quality.
0,It's impossible to tell whether the film's ending is happy because it's happy or because it's ending.
1,"It's a discomfiting character study in which compelling, convincing acting and lively dialogue help mitigate the feeling that none of these people are worth spending time with."
0,"While Smart People, wouldn't necessarily have taken off with a different leading actor, Quaid's self-conscious characterization calls attention to the artificiality of the story's construction."
1,"Quaid finds what is funny and endearing and worthy in the character, and his performance holds this fine, if somewhat fragile, film together."
1,"First-time director Noam Murro successfully creates a world you want to spend time in, even if it's a world marred by self-absorption and missed opportunities."
1,Smart People made me happy from start to finish.
1,Call it a 'could see' -- something you can drop in on when you have nothing better to do and emerge from feeling not at all cheated by the experience.
0,"Though the principals are so appealing with their smart, comical exchanges, the film's forced situations keep it from being the clever, engaging tale it aspires to be."
0,Just one person saves Smart People from being completely wretched. It's the presence of Thomas Haden Church.
1,"As tough as Lawrence is to like, Smart People is even harder to hate, mainly because of the sharply observed script by novelist Mark Jude Poirier."
1,Nobody does steely quite like the basso-voiced Page -- her Vanessa is a sort of Young Republican version of Juno.
0,"When you toss this many balls in the air, several are bound to be forgotten."
1,"Call the cops. Oscar nominees Ellen Page and Thomas Haden Church steal Smart People right from under the noses of its ostensible stars, Sarah Jessica Parker and Dennis Quaid."
0,"In what world does Smart People exist? Clearly not the real one, though this dramedy wants to think it's filled with ironic insights about love and family."
0,"The film brandishes the same anti-intellectual clich챕 we've heard time and again: Extremely smart folks are inherently unpleasant, uptight and unhappy. 'Tis better to be a touch dumb."
0,Smart People isn't so much anti-intellectual as it is hyper-ignorant of the ways in which people interact and behave.
1,"The thorny dialogue, the rancorous arguments, the unexplained surliness of Lawrence's son -- all that nasty stuff melts away, covering up plot weaknesses in a warm glow of nuclear-family bonhomie."
1,"Smart is indeed the word for Smart People, an extremely well-acted film that manages to be simultaneously funny and troubling."
0,"Parker, cast as the Life-Affirming Option, comes across as rather drab. Quaid disappears beneath his beard and into his role, yet because Lawrence is such a remote character, it's hard to care much. Page's role is pretty thin and monotonous."
0,"Quaid and Church are funny, but too much of this film is not half as smart as it thinks it is."
1,The characters are credible and sharply observed and all four actors go to town.
0,"None of the characters' or the filmmakers' knowledge illuminates, deepens, or complicates this movie in a way that keeps you from thinking longingly of Curtis Hanson's Wonder Boys."
0,"More false than Ms. Hilton's ""accidental"" panty-flashings, Noam Murro's dull, meandering dramedy reduces love to a montage and mourning to Quaid's inability to ride shotgun"
1,"The performances go a long way toward making Smart People an enjoyable, if familiar, outing."
0,There's a gulf between what Smart People should be and what it actually is.
1,"In his first film as director, Noam Murro creates moments of comic disconnection, relieved by -cule surges of warmth. He's very precise; he has a nice touch."
1,"Good acting, nice smart script."
0,[A] middling romantic comedy.
1,"The excellent script for Smart People is the work of Mark Jude Poirier, a fiction writer who has clearly spent enough time around English departments to have studied the tribal ways of the literary professoriate with ethnographic rigor."
1,"So much good work must not go overlooked. I just loved this movie because it's witty, intellectual without being pretentious, and filled with characters who are logically stressed and anxious to connect to a world outside of themselves."
1,"Smart People is an indie film that plays the (jangle, jangle) same chords (strum, strum) as a lot of other heartfelt comedies about too-wise children and codgers taking humanity lessons."
1,"Smarter than your average romantic comedy it may be, but this family-dysfunction indie is playing it a bit safe."
1,
0,"Unfortunately, Smart People has nothing original to say about its characters' dilemmas, but is content to tread waters that previous films have navigated with more humor and insight."
0,If there's a more depressing release this year then God help us all.
1,"Nice performances from Shearsmith and Serkis, and some outrageous ketchupy grossout, though I have to say The Cottage has nothing like the rigour, originality or power of Williams's debut."
1,This film is fabulously deranged.
1,"This is cartoon carnage with a slightly surreal twist - most notably in Peter's encounter with a swarm of moths - but the developing bond between the brothers makes it surprisingly poignant too. All things considered, you'll forgive the shaky parts."
0,"Andy Serkis shouts a lot, as if raising the decibel level will compensate for the dire dialogue, while Jennifer Ellison displays more cleavage than acting ability."
1,lively if programmatic horror pic
0,"It's like a time bomb that's never dismantled but never explodes. The movie is good enough that the ending leaves you ... not angry, exactly. Unfulfilled."
1,An effectively involving journalism-cum-conspiracy yarn with a bang-bang opening and a frantic closer.
1,"Despite the quaint depiction of a packed newsroom bustling with activity, the debates about quick online hits vs. hard-hitting investigations, between selling papers with fluff vs. offering actual substance, feel relevant and real."
0,"There is nothing we haven't seen here before in terms of chases, intrigue and betrayals, so for all its A-list cast and production values, the film comes off as routine."
1,"This efficient, admirably coherent thriller about reporters digging down to where politics and murder meet in Washington, D.C., has a wistful air about it as regards the fourth estate at a time when the profession is dangling by a thread."
1,The resulting tale unfolds with an urgency and sense of verisimilitude that will keep most viewers intrigued and involved without losing many along the way.
1,[An] excitingly twisty and topical new politics-and-media conspiracy thriller.
1,"As dense as a Watergate era newspaper and as immediate as a blog, State of Play is an absolutely riveting state-of-the-art ""big conspiracy"" thriller."
1,"State of Play, based on the outstanding British television series, is a first-rate political thriller, but it's also something more."
0,"State of Play is the latest incoherently written, mass-entertainment gibberish by the overrated Tony Gilroy."
1,It is Mr. Crowe who lends State of Play a sense of perpetual urgency as he traverses the corridors of power in search of massive wrongdoing at the risk of his own life.
1,State of Play keeps the twists coming.
1,"A busy thriller that moves between the worlds of newspapers and politics, Kevin Macdonald's State of Play zips along smoothly."
1,"Though it is a well-crafted political thriller, State of Play may actually have more to say about the beleaguered state of print journalism than about governmental shenanigans."
1,"Based on a hit BBC miniseries, State of Play features a handsome production and terrific performances from its aforementioned stars."
1,It's a pleasure watching this cast make the most of the material.
1,The journalist in me loved State of Play. The moviegoer in me even more so.
1,It's Bateman who adds juice just as too many conspiracies threaten to spoil the stew. His cameo as a hustling scuzzball is the film's most memorable performance.
1,"Though solidly plotted and executed all around, the film feels like a quaint relic from another era, aping the form of journalistic thrillers like All The President's Men while missing much of their urgency."
0,"Instead of luring us down an ever-darker and twistier path, it strands us in a tedious and ill-designed maze."
1,"An unrepentantly mature suspense flick; there're no jokes, no breasts and no explosions. Even as the secrets spill out, the sense is of a world compressing, not unraveling."
0,"You've seen it all before, including the paunch Russell Crowe sported in Body of Lies, but with one exception: One intrepid reporter here is a blogger."
1,"Crowe turns in a strong performance as the conflicted McAffrey. McAdams is equally convincing as Frye, who gets a quick education in journalistic basics."
1,Its depiction of a newsroom is so realistic you'll be surprised to learn the scenes were filmed on a set.
1,"A smart, ingenious thriller set in the halls of Congress and the city room of a newspaper not unlike the Washington Post."
0,"A meandering movie that sometimes hits dead center and sometimes misfires dismally, resulting in a drama more tangled than taut."
1,"It's a film in a hurry. In the scant minutes between plot twists, we get treated to bite-size nuggets of character development and a few juicy nibbles of acting from a cast almost universally committed to going large."
0,"Giving new meaning to movie magic, those Hollywood tricksters have managed to shorten the story while slowing the pace -- all of a sudden, minutes are passing like hours."
0,"This rote paranoid thriller was adapted from a 2003 BBC miniseries, with a few topical headlines folded in and some cursory attempts to make newspapers seem au courant."
0,State of Play is bordered by the states of absurdity and clich챕.
1,"Holds together in proper, conspiracy-thriller style, providing general audiences with a few good surprises and some crackling performances."
0,"State of Play makes you wonder where we'll be in a decade; more importantly, it makes you wonder where we are now."
1,"State of Play does get a little creaky in its last third -- at that point it needs to be more streamlined, more concise. But Macdonald and the screenwriters manage to weave their ideas through a sturdy-enough plot, so we never feel we're being preached to"
1,"This conspiracy thriller, starring Russell Crowe as an investigative newspaper reporter and Helen Mirren as his fire/ice editor, comes at us like the proverbial bat out of hell and keeps up a brisk rhythm built for intelligence."
1,"For about 115 minutes, State of Play tells an alarming, tightly constructed story, with serious things to say about journalism and the state of the country."
1,"The movie doesn't quite work, but even when it's misfiring it has an old-fashioned appeal."
0,"For a handy compare-and-contrast, check out the small- and big-screen versions of State of Play. You'll see the difference between a vital work of popular art and a patched-up retread."
0,The chance to explore the swiftly changing culture of Web-age journalism is one of several intriguing possibilities that State of Play squanders.
1,"Directed by Kevin Macdonald, it's a capable if convoluted 'B' movie about government corruption, with an 'A' cast furiously pounding the pavement and keyboard."
0,[A] film that has spent an hour and forty-five minutes puffing itself into a battle for the Soul of American Democracy feebly hisses its way to a deflated conclusion.
1,The kind of acting Crowe does here won't win awards and doesn't scream for attention. Yet it serves the thriller conventions as well as the old-warrior-journalist cliches in style.
0,"The three screenwriters may have been trying to work too many plot strands into two hours; in any case, State of Play is both overstuffed and inconclusive."
1,It's sentimental in all the right ways.
1,"As a former reporter and a fervent believer that we need good, independent newspapers to do their jobs keeping government and business in check, I think they got the journalism right."
1,I want to see more films like this.
1,"Despite the clich챕d nature of much of the dialogue and the derivative thriller set-ups, 'State of Play' provides sufficient old-fashioned entertainment value to justify the ticket."
1,"This is exhilarating, compulsive storytelling and looks likely to be one of the year's cinematic highlights."
1,"State of Play rattles along very satisfactorily, and Crowe brings to the role a relaxed self-possession and even charm."
1,State of Play doesn't betray its source material. It's not a huge let-down. It's a perfectly satisfactory evening's entertainment. But I wish it could have been more than that.
1,"Pacy, thought-provoking entertainment. Not perfect, but well worth the admission."
1,"This is a smart, knowing addition to the great tradition of 1970s paranoid political thrillers, and as such includes several references to Watergate as well as featuring, as it had to, a tense sequence in an underground car-park."
0,"It's a prestige picture all the way, supercompetent, polished, watchable - but oddly unexciting."
1,"How it plays out makes, in the hands of an excellent director such as Macdonald, a taut and clever thriller - even if it's not as modern as it likes to believe."
1,State of Play succeeds as mainstream entertainment to the point where it hardly makes sense to complain about its pulled political punches.
1,It's really a story about the romance of newspapers and a good one - part of a tradition that goes all the way back to Ben Hecht and The Front Page. It may also mark the genre's end.
1,
0,There is no getting around that the film is as dry as an unpaved country road.
1,"The plot is reasonably convincing, the pace tight, the laid-back score of jazz guitar and harmonica suitable to a film about country living, in which blood and gore are conspicuously absent."
1,
1,The readings of Dalton Trumbo's letters to family and friends are starkly rendered-famous faces...recite rousing missives without the aid of sets or props of any kind save for Trumbo's own thunderous proclamations in defense of free speech.
1,"Trumbo emerges as a son's bittersweet valentine to his old man, and a tribute to the senior Trumbo's resilience, wit, and outrage in the face of a national disgrace."
0,"Balancing the political and the personal is a smart idea, though the resulting togglethon ends up being the uneasiest of marriages."
0,What kind of international revolutionary whines about his family being made unwelcome among the tykes of the bourgeoisie?
1,"Using Trumbo's letters, statements, speeches and scripts, director Peter Askin creates a rich portrait of a cantankerous, principled man of words."
1,Trumbo is an unconventional film about an unconventional man.
1,"Family home movies and photos and archival clips round out the film, which holds its hero-worshiping to fairly tolerable levels."
1,"The best way to learn about Trumbo is through his writing, which is spirited, dry, and utterly convinced of its truth"
1,Peter Askin's stirring documentary Trumbo gives you reasons to cheer but also to weep.
1,"The substance of those letters, along with documentary footage and a touching appearance by Kirk Douglas, throws a baleful light on a bleak chapter of American history."
1,"Trumbo is well worth seeing for what it tells us about the age in which this irrepressible individualist lived, loved, suffered and finally triumphed."
1,It is oddly pleasant to know that such a man once existed.
1,"A celebration of a large-hearted contrarian, and if it's over-worshipful, the film gets you in an indulgent frame of mind."
1,"Although it glosses over a few relevant details, Trumbo also functions as a passionate defense of truth from a writer who embodied all of the virtues that America claims to value."
1,It will serve as a fine entry point for younger auds interested in learning about theprice paid by moviemakers and their families swept up in the 1950s anti-Communist net.
1,"The film is an enlightening recap of '50s Red Scare politics, and a parade of actors giving meaningful, earnest readings of Trumbo's speeches and letters."
1,It's a pleasure to meet a truly moral man in a documentary that rightly heralds his name.
1,"A ousing documentary as ornery, orotund and captivating as its subject."
1,"The transporting power of this experience is in the passionate and almost outlandishly eloquent verbal expression Trumbo poured into his correspondence, and the vividly American principles he defends."
1,
0,"The film has more of a checklist of clichs than an actual script and, when it comes to the cast, director Gil Cates Jr. is scraping the bottom of the barrel."
0,"A product of the recent poker craze, this can't compare with the movie that helped launch it, John Dahl's tense Rounders."
0,Deal is perhaps too briskly paced: The narrative moves along a bit too fleetingly for any genuine character development.
0,"Moving slowly these days, Burt Reynolds does less than no acting in this role, and he's still the best thing in Deal."
0,Reynolds doesn't convey any of the lightning bolt insouciance that made him arguably the greatest movie star of the '70s and '80s (really) but rather just stands there.
0,Success isn't in the cards for this plodding poker drama.
0,Deal could use a touch of the slickness that's making the blackjack drama 21 such a greasy hit.
0,They've got to do something else with these poker movies.

1,"Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which is pretty much the prime directive in filmmaking."
0,"In order to play John Lennon's assassin Mark David Chapman, actor Jared Leto gained some 70 pounds. Seemingly following his lead, the pic itself is heavy, lethargic, and exasperating."
1,"Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration."
0,"Don't hammer this film for trying to get inside the head of Mark David Chapman before he shot John Lennon outside the rock legend's New York apartment on December 8th, 1980. Hammer it instead for failing to do so with any depth or insight."
0,"This misbegotten psychological portrait eagerly foregrounds Leto's excess blubber and histrionic blather, delivered like bad improv outside the Dakota building."
1,"Even if you are only moderately curious about the events that led up to the pointless death of a musical icon, I think you'll find it a film of arm-twisting fascination."
0,It might even be bad enough to inspire Catcher author J.D. Salinger to break his decades of public silence to speak out against this high-camp fiasco.
0,All their efforts can't elevate this material above the arty exploitation that it is.
0,"Leto, who gained poundage for the role, keeps taking his shirt off just to make it clear that he is the latest in a long line of actors to confuse daily patronage of the local doughnut shop with intensive actorly preparation."
1,"Leto's drawling, blotchy, creepy performance sets it apart."
0,"Any film that dares attempt a nonjudgmental portrait of John Lennon's assassin would most likely be accused of tastelessness, but in the case of Chapter 27 the charges are justified."
1,"This is a very tough film to watch, especially for Beatles fans that worshipped Lennon, but it does provide a thought-provoking take on the inner workings of Mark David Chapman's twisted mind."
0,"There are cheesy special effects and even cheesier gags, and the schmaltz eventually piles on neck-deep."
1,"Chapter 27 is far from flawless, but Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion."
1,"The film is impressively mounted and Schaefer has made a directorial debut of distinction, but it is an uncomfortable ride from the opening scenes of Chapman arriving in New York to the inevitable, inexorable final scene."
1,"By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like."
0,"his drama, about the three days leading up to the murder, never overcomes its inherent ghoulishness, largely because Chapman, like so many mentally ill people, is a huge bore."
0,"Chapter 27 just makes you feel bad for, and about, everybody -- including the wretched souls who made the thing."

0,Reilly jumps into his role with the zeal of a Method actor -- no fear about sporting tiny underroos for the bulk of his screen time -- but he sometimes comes off as more scary than funny.
1,"Step Brothers is stupid. Childish. Moronic. Simple. Juvenile. Silly. Just ridiculous. Man, is it funny."
0,"Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are essentially playing the same person, which is the movie's fundamental, irreparable flaw."
1,Ferrell is the third best teenage boy I've ever seen but John C. Reilly may be the greatest comic actor of our generation -- he's fearlessly earnest and incapable of mugging.
0,Few films are worse to sit through than comedies that don't work. Step Brothers is one of those.
0,"It's hard to believe that two people could reach middle age acting like grade-schoolers, and not in a funny way, either."
1,"Thank god that when he became a man, Will Ferrell never put away childish things. His Step Brothers is so childish it seems to arrive in diapers, and that's not bad; it's good."
1,"Starting at infantile and regressing hysterically from there, Step Brothers flies on the comic chemistry of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly."
0,"Though McKay and his cast make the most of the material, Step Brothers is constrained by its one-joke concept."
1,"Full of riffy, improvised moments and a couple of jaw-droppingly raunchy sight gags, the comedy follows a typical buddy-movie arc -- conflict and loathing giving way to bonding and brotherhood, or step-brotherhood in this case."
0,"Seesawing from the gleefully stupid to the desperately stupid, Step Brothers is an indicator that the Judd Apatow juggernaut has made one too many trips to the well."
1,"The trick to the Men II Boyz comic genre -- where grown men are simply older, pudgier versions of their teen selves, struggling to find their place in the world -- is to find the surprises and payoffs within the Peter Pan syndrome."
1,"Nudie magazines, dog poop, words like 'mangina' -- if these are a few of your favorite things, Step Brothers is the comedy for you."
0,"Ferrell and Reilly get more mileage out of juvenile pouting and bickering than any other performers I can imagine, but that's about as far as this goes."
0,"When did comedies get so mean? Step Brothers has a premise that might have produced a good time at the movies, but when I left, I felt a little unclean."
1,"Step Brothers is hit-and-miss, but it made me wish that the usual American comedy of 'how stupid can we get?' had this much rage."
1,"Brideshead Revisited, it turns out, deserves a revisit."
0,"There's a good subject for satire here, the extended adolescence of American kids. But satire presupposes maturity, or at least some perspective."
0,"The concept is inherently funny, but the plot grows thin and the laughs grow fewer once the premise is established."
0,"A movie of unrelenting idiocy featuring boorish behaviour, unrealistic character development and ludicrous plotting."
1,"Ferrell, the Hollywood star most notorious for going naked in his movies, shows off only his belly, and that for a teasing second. For most of the rest of the time, you'll be reveling in, or enduring, one more exhibition of grown men playing children."
1,"It doesn't rank high in the lowbrow-comedy genre that has produced legitimately smart entries such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin or Knocked Up, but it does succeed as a token contender by delivering real laughs at the expense of intelligence and decency."
1,"Stupid, crude and hilarious, Step Brothers works by sneaking past our better judgment."
1,"It's not subtle, not the cleverest thing Apatow has put his name on. But for lowdown, cheap and dirty laughs, it's pretty hard to beat Reilly and Ferrell, riffing, trashing and trash-talking each other for 94 mostly mean, sometimes manic minutes."
1,"Although the comedy is a little messed-up and childish itself, it still delivers a few good laughs."
1,"I thought I knew funny, but I was mistaken. Before the blessed light of Step Brothers entered my life, I knew not the sweet comedic splendors of live burial, bunk-bed catastrophe or a minivan family singing 'Sweet Child O' Mine' in four-part harmony."
0,"Watching people act like kids is annoying. Now everyone can join in the un-fun with Step Brothers, Will Ferrell's latest summed-up-in-one-line concept comedy that tests our patience so much more than his previous movies did."
1,"This is ultimately Ferrell and Reilly's show, and although the two actors have played plenty of stooges in the past, they've never done it with quite the same abandon they do here."
0,"If you put the collected works of Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Judd Apatow in a pot, boiled off the excess and let the remainder cool, you'd have something very much like Step Brothers."
1,"Do not go to Step Brothers looking for anything remotely meaningful, sincere or spiritually enhancing. Go for a laugh. It's got plenty of them."
0,"The unraveling isn't as smartly written as the setup. And because the characters beyond the parents and boys aren't as finely tuned, the film starts to lag."
1,"The engine that drives this flick is the chemistry between Mr. Reilly and Mr. Ferrell. The two obviously delight in each other's company, and it feels good and is funny to watch."
0,"Director Adam McKay is a veteran of the Judd Apatow school of R-rated gross-out gooniness, but this latest installment in the canon is decidedly underpowered."
1,"Has one joke that it beats into the ground: 40-year-old men acting like petulant 9-year-olds. Luckily, Ferrell and Reilly were born with no shame or sense of personal dignity, and they give good tantrum."
0,"A meagre, occasionally funny affair."
0,"Noisy, fitfully amusing, ultimately tiresome havoc."
0,"Exhausted is how many audiences members will feel after squirming through such a repetitive, one-joke comedy."
0,"Don't watch it on an airplane, don't check it out on cable, don't walk past the bargain basement bin where it's been sold."
1,"Dude, the film so totally happens to be great."
0,"For a while their stupid rivalry, insults and petulant displays of outrage are funny, but like the talented child who won't be quiet for a second, the act eventually begins to grate."
1,"Adam McKay's movie hits inspiration often enough to overcome its pedestrian plot, and the sight of Ferrell bawling like a baby somehow gets funnier each time."
0,This goofy comedy is a DVD rental only.
0,Digestible if you can stomach the crude nostalgia. A disaster if you expect art and crafts.
1,"Despite some obvious flaws, 'Step Brothers' remains a hugely enjoyable, well-constructed slice of lowbrow Saturday night entertainment, leaving Ferrell's position as the reigning king of US comedy secure for a while longer."
1,"One thing spoils the mood: for all the joy that Ferrell and Reilly take in brawling or whimpering like two-year-olds, immaturity is still seen as something to be overcome."
1,"Between occasional guffaws and more frequent hand-over-mouth, oh-my-God moments, I started to think about where American comedy has come from and where it's going."
1,Unremittingly juvenile and irredeemably funny.
1,"On its own terms, Step Brothers is hilarious. But it's a shame that the filmmakers didn't have more faith in the audience. Why resort to gross-out tactics when your premise is strong enough to allow for a more sophisticated approach?"
1,The shouty variety of manchild comedy that Ferrell has cribbed from Jerry Lewis divides movie fans intensely. Here's the one we should put in the time capsule.
1,It isn't even the funniest movie I've seen this year. But it sure made me laugh.
1,The potentially gooey conclusion is leavened with cynical irreverence.
0,"Botched is bungled - irredeemably, at times even enjoyably, so."
0,"In the end, though, there's only so much slack you can give a film that wears its cheapness and ineptitude like badges of honour."
0,"Stupid, slipshod stuff."
1,"It kicks off with a wallop, then constantly confounds expectations by approaching its subject matter from fresh directions."

1,"As a follow-up to his striking 2002 directorial debut, The Believer, this second obsessive study in fanaticism by writer-director Henry Bean has its own delirious integrity and outsider-art charm."
1,"Noise is a funny movie about a serious issue, delivered tongue in cheek but with real conviction."
1,"Noise is never quite as smart as it tries to be. But as summer and its mouth-breathing blockbusters loom large on the horizon, there's something touching about a movie that even tries."
0,"[Director] Bean writes interesting scripts that toy with big ideas, but the films that result aren't always good. (Or even bearable.) Here he sets out to make an aural Fight Club, but instead he's made a movie about a guy who really needs to buy earplugs."
0,"Like the car alarms it demonizes, Noise is insistent and initially attention-grabbing -- but eventually a little one-note and empty."
1,The movie has enough big-city wickedness and merry cruelty to keep things skittering unpredictably.
1,"If Noise takes a certain New York path and tries to gently negotiate rather than smash things, Robbins and Hurt at least manage to keep it real."
0,"Noise, the second part of a projected 'fanatic trilogy', is shallow and loud."
1,A splendidly eccentric independent film written and directed by Henry Bean.
1,"There's an intriguing canvas here, but Bean paints in broad strokes and then just sort of gives up at the end."
1,"A tale of obsession and vigilantism cut with humor and a little Hegel, Henry Bean's Noise is a satisfyingly screwy New York story in which a successful businessman/family man jettisons all because he can't stand the cacophony on the street."
0,"It's wickedly amusing for a little bit, but ultimately the film becomes what it's fighting: just noise."
1,The black comedy Noise may be a one-joke movie but it's a resonant one.
0,Amusing but marginal.
1,"Amid the seasonal din of so many raucous summer blockbusters, Noise offers blessed relief in the form of a strong central performance, sharp dialogue and edgy humor."
1,How can you resist a hero who gets worked up because a car alarm disrupts his extremely tenuous grasp on a difficult but life altering passage of Hegel?
0,[David] Novack's...inability to tell a compelling story makes it difficult for us to summon outrage.
1,David Novack's documentary Burning the Future: Coal in America is as upsetting as it is informative.
1,"Pic deeply entrenches itself in the landscape, conveying both the beauty and the ravagement of the Appalachians."
1,"[Director] Novack has a dual focus: the U.S. consumption of coal, which accounts for just more than half the nation's energy, and 'mountaintop removal,' whereby companies, instead of actually mining, do a man-made Mount St. Helens."
0,"Miscast and miscalculated, Miss Conception hopes to collect on Hollywood's recent baby-on-board craze, delivering instead the least credible take on human pregnancy since Arnold Schwarzenegger gave birth in Junior."
0,"Graham is charming, but Miss Conception is a cloddish biological-clock bedroom farce."
0,"Miss Conception isn't so much a movie as an extended sitcom -- it looks like one, it acts like one, it reduces everything to the lowest common denominator like one."
0,"Eric Styles and writer Camilla Leslie have made a punishingly unfunny trifle about sex, love and maternity in which both women and men are flatter than magazines--walking, talking issues of Lady's Home Journal and Maxim."
0,It feels more like a small-screen distraction.
1,A depressing but well-made adaptation of a Philip Roth novella by Spanish director Isabel Coixet.
1,"Of all the good actors who have adorned the middle-aged-professor films, Ben Kingsley, in Elegy, is the most formidable and convincing."
0,"Elegy is a spare, melancholy film that is so far in spirit from its source, Philip Roth's The Dying Animal, that I'm tempted to say we should abandon altogether the idea of adapting Roth."
1,There is much tragedy and truth in what the makers of this movie have brought to the screen.
1,"Elegy sneaks up on you anyway -- even overacted, Roth's intelligence shines through."
1,"If I recommend Elegy to my readers, it is not as a licentiously escapist entertainment, but, rather, as a soberingly eloquent expression of what our lives are all about, whether we want to think about them or not."
0,"It's beautiful, but nobody involved was ever sure what the movie was actually about, or why they were making it."
1,"A spare, meditative and melancholy film."
1,Spanish director Isabel Coixet displays what is almost reverence for the material. You can imagine her whispering on the set. She brings out the absolute best in her top-notch cast.
1,"As an acting showcase that builds to some unexpectedly moving moments, Elegy has much to recommend it."
0,A windbaggy film of Phillip Roth's novella The Dying Animal.
0,"The movie dog days of August can include dramas, as this abashed adaptation of a Philip Roth novel shows."
0,"Elegy seems to mourn for the wrong things, making its self-examining characters seem merely narcissistic and more than a little pathetic."
1,"While this may seem like an apologia for randy older men, it doesn't come off that way, and Cruz gives her best performance to date."
1,"Whether in trying to reach out for a wider audience here she has diluted her talent in favour of a richer, more stylish surface is a matter for argument. The smoother this kind of film gets, the easier it is to think it."
1,Coixet has done more than honour it; she has found a tenderness and vulnerability that were so deeply buried as to be almost undetectable.
0,"Elegy makes us question again the cinema's ability, without loss of heat and light, to translate Roth's subtle, high-voltage prose from page to screen."
0,"There's bracing stuff here about male insecurity and cowardice when it comes to the crunch, but for all Kepesh's worldliness, his character is nothing else but a walking clich."
1,An intelligent film for grown-ups.
0,"Elegy is such a serious, oftentimes grave exploration of desire and the ways of aging that it's a miracle the two central characters have as much sex as they do."
1,"Touching, wonderfully acted examination of the corrosive effects of doubt on love."
1,"This is adult story-telling, elegantly restrained and unmistakably classy, which casts a dispassionate eye on a man who loses heart at the same time as he loses his youth, potency and relevancy."
1,"Overall, though, the film falls just short, due in no small part to unimaginative music selections, which drain its individuality in favour of mere generic arthouse melancholia."
1,"Director Isabel Coixet sees David's tragedy, but also his life force, and she draws brilliant work out of Cruz."
1,"Wonderful writing, good performances, beautiful photography, and a lot of food for thought."
1,"The delicious conflict of a thinker poleaxed by his feelings inflames Isabel Coixet's smoldering Elegy, based on Roth's novella The Dying Animal."
1,"Elegy is a curious example of misplaced good taste. Spanish-born director Isabel Coixet's film, adapted by Nicholas Meyer, recasts into softer, more palatable material the...third in Philip Roth's stories driven by the sensual obsessions of Roth al"
1,Elegy gives Ben Kingsley one of the best roles of his career.
1,"It's beautifully photographed and slowly paced, all the better to emphasize the film's emphasis on and exploration of deep feelings."
1,The best dramatic film of the year so far.
1,"Director Isabel Coixet (My Life Without Me) keeps the focus on Kepesh, played by Kingsley in a performance that brings sympathy and humanity to a selfish, imperious, predatory man."
1,"Occasionally touching, always interesting."
1,"Kingsley perfectly tunes his performance to these psychological nuances, the strong features in his face undone by an anxious flicker of his eyes."
1,It's nicely done.
1,A remarkable example of the actor at his best -- conveying wounded hurt or burning hunger with a glance.
1,"Elegy is a rare treat: a serious film that, thanks to Kingsley and the rest, doesn't seem to take itself too seriously."
0,Penelope Cruz is outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy.
1,"Sparse, low-budget drama, helmed by Spaniard Isabel Coixet, intelligently translates Roth's meditation on lust and mortality without soft-pedaling its narrator's brutally honest, unabashedly sexist views."
1,
1,"With his fierce, impeccable craft Kingsley shows us around David's tortured, preening, desperate psyche."
1,"Coixet has blunted the impact of the novel's ending just as she has softened Roth's misanthropic depiction of Kepesh and, as a result, she's taken flak for being over-polite. I didn't care."
1,"Short on sensational elements but involving, it won't set multiplexes on fire but should make a decent showing thanks to cast and plot."
1,"Production values are tops, and Lukas Ettlin's athletic camerawork -- coursing through the streets of Boyle Heights and other Los Angeles locations -- adds a kinetic element to a film that is half thriller, half psychodrama."
1,This winning combination of neighborhood indie and old-school Hollywood B movie is the kind of film that doesn't flinch from the sight of a bullet being removed from human flesh.
1,"John Leguizamo knocks it out of the park as an armored car driver in The Take, which is quite a bit better than you'd expect from a low-budget thriller that's getting a token theatrical release a month ahead of its DVD debut."
1,"Perez and Leguizamo make an entirely believable couple, and director Brad Furman creates an intense undercurrent of intimacy between the audience and his haunted hero."
1,"Mr. Furman, who also directs music videos, has given the movie, shot by Lukas Ettlin, a bleached-out, unglossy look. Occasionally the visuals seem overly stylized, but Mr. Furman knows enough to showcase his stars' unvarnished performances."
1,"Brisk and agreeable, a handcrafted ode to the brew that is the beverage of choice where the Chinese, among many others, are concerned."
1,The film is both delightful and informative at every turn.
1,"The film's quick-and-dirty verite yields some delightful caught moments, steeped in historical footnotes that only enhance."
1,All in This Tea is a delicious documentary about a beverage.

1,"With appreciably greater emphasis on action than its predecessors, and clever use of 3-D trickery to enhance storytelling as well as offer spectacle, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs could prove the third time really is the charm."
1,"A sweet little comedy, both family-friendly and centered on a nontraditional family ??and so suitable for pretty much everyone."
0,Why does the third installment of this animated tale often feel so glacial it's a wonder Ray Romano's Manny the mammoth doesn't freeze in his tracks?
0,What? Dawn of the dinosaurs? In the Ice Age? You've got to be kidding.
0,There's little evidence of creativity either in the paint-by-numbers time-travelling plot or the sort of ad-libs you associate with gag writers sitting around a boardroom table.
0,"Yes, dinosaurs are cool. Just not cool enough to save this sequel."
0,Director Carlos Saldanha did such an excellent job infusing the second installment with energy that it's a shame he was unable to do the same with Part 3.
0,Even the antics of little Scrat fall flat this time. The rodent whose pursuit of an elusive nut was the highlight of the first movies are tired and strained here.
0,Prehistory repeats itself in this dispiritingly slothful third installment.
0,Some of the jokes work. The story seems concocted by a committee of Blackberries. But the 3D CG animation is quite an improvement from the first two films.
0,"This is pretty silly stuff, even for a children's movie, and it sort of sells out the one original point the series used to have: Here was a prehistoric adventure that refused to go the yabba-dabbo-do route."
0,Most of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is pedestrian kiddie fare. At least the 3D helps counter the film's prevailing dullness.
0,Treacly and barely amusing.
0,"Even new scenes involving the once-hilarious Scrat, the hapless critter who can't hold onto an acorn, feel worn out. That's when you know it's time to go."
1,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the best of the three films about our friends in the inter-species herd of plucky prehistoric heroes.
1,"The animation is first-rate, and the first look at the lost world beneath the ice is stunning, particularly in 3-D."
0,"Never representative of more than mediocrity from a technical or story-based standpoint, the Ice Age series has reached a new nadir with its third entry."
0,"It's not utterly without charm. Only here, that charm feels less earned than manufactured, a product not of evolution -- or even intelligent design -- but of cynical, soulless opportunism."
1,This rambunctious outing -- the third in the franchise -- is cute enough to engage kids and just smart enough to keep the chaperones entertained.
0,"If the third Ice Age were a bit better, there would be little need to dwell on the inconsistencies."
0,Nobody seems to be working too hard in Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.
0,"With its three-dimensional action and two-dimensional feelings, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is warmed-over nonsense."
1,"Nice, sweet, safe."
1,The finest idiosyncratic pleasure of this franchise remains the ongoing relationship of hapless squirrel-rat Scrat to his beloved acorn.
1,"This is true family fun. Not the two-tiered sort where there are potty jokes for the kids and pop culture references for the parents. Not only will everyone be laughing at the same time, they'll be laughing at the same things."
0,"What follows: crude jokes, sweet lessons, Simon Pegg as an adventurer gone insane, and a bunch of decent animation, which select patrons will see in impressive 3-D. Ideally they'll be about 8 years old and hopped up on Junior Mints."
0,"Lacking even the briefest flicker of a joke not culled from the fart-gag, pop-cultural-reference grab bag, the latest installment in Fox's most durable kiddie franchise offers unreasonably devoted parents less than usual to look forward to."
1,"This third trip to the Ice Age cooler should delight families with its amusing new dino buddies, even as it risks terrifying tots."
0,There's no breathing life into a formula that ought to have bowed out gracefully while the going was good.
0,"Not bad, not good."
1,
0,And that overriding air of cuteness is a problem that seems destined to get worse in the sequels which will surely follow. Battle fatigue has definitely set in.
0,"Rather than evolving, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs treads on familiar and infertile ground."
0,"There's a sense of ineptness in a script that constantly reaches, with only modest success, for amusing things that the mammoths and their friends can do."
0,"There are chases and escapes, morals and messages, comedy and character... but when the fur stops flying, it still feels more frozen than fresh."
1,"As with the two earlier films, it's all a mite disorderly in tempo but often highly amusing and great fun in the main."
0,"Children will probably enjoy Ice Age 3, but adults may find the script a little over-sophisticated, not to say conflicted in its attitudes towards women."
0,"Whereas the previous chapters were sweetly anarchic, full of wisecracks and narrative digressions but also curious about eco-issues such as global warming and the extinction of species, this effort is dramatically inert and uninspired."
1,Ice Age series comes fully endorsed as a safe ride for all ages.
1,"Sure, this threequel is more plasticine than Pleistocene, but as a zippy summer diversion it'll do more than nicely - in fact, it's comfortably the best of the series."
0,"Even the little boy in the second row, dragged along by a parent for a treat, was frozen in silence, victim of that cyclical ice age that affects audiences powerless to fend off the cryogenic effect of a sub-zero digimation romp."
1,"It's not nearly as funny or as cute as it needs to be, but it will do as holiday entertainment for children who liked the first two and have reasonably short memories."
1,"Though there's not much of a story, the animation is expert and imaginative."
0,"Certainly not terrible, but ultimately forgettable and that means you should skip it."
0,The whole movie is more of the same and I'm afraid the franchis is running out of steam.
0,"The manic pace quickly grows tiresome, as does the influx of cloying baby animals."
1,[An] infectiously upbeat bigscreen extension of Disney Channel's runaway TV movie sensation.
0,"Even within the confines of G-rated fluff, it could have been a lot sassier."
1,"High School Musical 3: Senior Year gives you an honest jolt of feel-good fizz. It may be as friendly and square as one of those 1950s teen romps in which the actors wore letter sweaters, but that doesn't mean the movie is an uptight anachronism."
0,"You hardly watch a Disney musical expecting Lars von Trier, but still, this is conservative stuff."
1,"Even if the refreshing gust doesn't stay with you long, it's fun while it lasts."
1,To witness Number 3 explode on the big screen in a theater hopping with fans is to experience Beatlemania for the millennials. Not since A Hard Day's Night have I seen such collective blissout. (If only HSM's music were that memorable!)
1,"Despite its own synthetic, over-processed production values, ""High School Musical 3"" exudes genuine appeal, thanks to director Kenny Ortega's brilliant choreography and a gifted cast."
0,"Coiffed with what must have been a budget-busting supply of styling gel, the cast of High School Musical 3: Senior Year looks not just freshly scrubbed, but manicured, exfoliated, and dipped in a vat of hot wax."
1,"HSM3 is eminently watchable, occasionally very funny, and sweet enough to give you diabetes."
0,"Efron and co-star Vanessa Hudgens have charm. But director Kenny Ortega buries them in formula dances, forgettable tunes and dialogue that makes Grease sound like Greek tragedy."
1,"For those kids in the target audience, this is movie nirvana."
1,"Musical 3 is frustratingly shallow, but what it lacks in narrative ambition, it makes up for in dazzling choreography."
1,It's a classic case of giving the people what they want.
0,Everything works out! Everyone's hair looks great! Some of the kids end up at Juilliard! I hope real high school is like this.
0,"Efron is once again Travolta-esque, although he appears to be quickly outgrowing this material. Hudgens is still annoyingly bland both in facial expressions and voice."
1,"Since when shouldn't it be fun to spend 90 minutes or so watching good-looking young people, singing and dancing relatively well?"
1,"If you aren't between the ages of six and 14 or don't have kids, you may have trouble getting into that Wildcat spirit. But don't be shocked if Senior Year takes you back, just a bit, and makes you wish every high school was a little like East High."
0,Sorry. Started to doze off.
0,"The movie sounds as though it was recorded in a padded chamber instead of a bustling school, and it looks like it came from some alternate world, one that basks in the eternal sunshine of the spotless skin."
1,It's hard to complain about a pop culture phenomenon built on unabashed innocence.
1,"The HSM series has always been playful and high-spirited, with a refreshing emphasis on collective action and the importance of group effort over the individual, and there's nothing in High School Musical 3: Senior Year to upset the formula."
1,Mr. Efron's athletic grace is Astaire-like in its casual authority. Ms. Hudgens's blissful smiles melt the screen.
1,Disney raised the stakes by turning its hit TV-movie franchise into a feature film -- and the bet has paid off.
1,"Go ahead, dance it out."
1,"If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed."
0,"For all its unforgivable blandness, High School Musical opens young audiences to the charms of this most transporting of movie genres."
0,"At best, you'll be disappointed; at worst, you'll want to blow up a high school."
1,"As far as slickly produced and joyfully energetic escapism goes, High School Musical 3 is top of the class."
0,High School Musical 3: Senior Year makes cellophane taste like chicken jalfrezi.
0,"Refitted for the big screen, it becomes an eerily plastic business, like a blown-up doll's house."
0,A bit of bloodshed would have enlivened proceedings enormously in the anodyne High School Musical 3.
0,"Next to this, Dawson's Creek and Gossip Girl look like Ken Loach."
0,I cringed for nearly two hours.

1,"Its winning formula is driven not by narrative but by what isn't there: no sex, no drugs, and no rock and roll-- unless you count the logjam of thundering power ballads."
0,So sweet you'll leave the cinema with diabetes.
1,"A real, honest-to-goodness teen musical throwback, as if Andy Hardy had never died and James Dean had never lived."
0,"High School Musical 3 overstays its welcome, stretching out about 20 minutes longer than it needs to, thanks chiefly to a final celebratory reel that simply refuses to end."
1,"To resort to strictly ethnocentric references, Fanaa is equal parts MGM extravaganza, Shakespeare lite and James Bond. In their heart of hearts, isn't that what movie audiences really want?"
1,"... Fanaa falls into the realm of disposable melodrama, yet is rendered strangely entertaining thanks to Aamir and Kajol."
1,Fanaa mines this conceit with an operatic extravagance -- and a body count -- that the Korean pulpmeister Park Chan Wook would envy.
1,...one of Herzog's best and most purely enjoyable.
1,"Midway through, an eerier theme creeps in, all the more powerful for Herzog's lack of insistence. By the 'end of the world' he means the end of the world."
1,"Perhaps because Herzog is approaching old-master status, Encounters at the End of the World skews toward the observational."
1,Few filmmakers make the end of days seem as hauntingly beautiful as Werner Herzog does in Encounters at the End of the World.
1,"The film plays a little like an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, except with scientists instead of cooks, though the low-stakes travelogue format allows for plenty of surprises and fun along the way."
1,"Granted, this documentary (surely the weirdest ever funded by the Discovery Channel) could have used more editing. But it's the notebook of a genius, and well worth cracking open."
1,"[Herzog] wants us to see how these quirky researchers, in their lust to explore, are acting out a drive as primitive as nature: the need to break away from the world in order to find it."
1,"Herzog the crank is a flimsy cover for Herzog the wonderstruck little boy, marveling at everything from the viscosity of seal milk (it pours like wax) to the spiderlike crab creatures that skitter along the ocean floor beneath the Ross Sea."
1,He [Herzog] is cinema's poet of the empty spaces.
1,"Encounters may lack the power of, say, the Herzog doc Grizzly Man, because it has no bigger-than-life character at its nexus, but it does confirm the filmmaker as an iconoclastic master."
1,A hypnotically digressive travelogue.
1,A supremely cranky and lyrical feat.
1,"This mystical, cynical, hypocritical elegy is his return to the deep after his somnolent The Wild Blue Yonder, and like it, plunges into the unique territory of Herzog's mind"
1,"In his latest documentary, Encounters at the End of the World, Herzog -- who warns the viewer at the outset not to expect any 'fluffy penguins' -- deals with the men and women who perform scientific research in Antarctica."
1,"Encounters at the End of the World is an enjoyable example of this extraordinary director's documentary work, and accessible enough to make it a good introduction to his singular vision."
1,"The images captured by Herzog and cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger are dazzling all on their own, finding the disorienting psychedelia that is nature at its weirdest."
1,Who better than Herzog to share with us the off-beat Encounters at the End of the World.
1,"It's one of the best documentaries of the year, no doubt about it."
1,"A contrarian spiritual journey as provocative as it is hypnotic, Herzog's Encounters at the End of the World literally treks to planet's end."
1,"Werner Herzog is a magnet for obsessives, and his lovely new film, Encounters at the End of the World, takes you places an ordinary filmmaker might've gone to yet missed completely."
1,"The sky is relentlessly blue, the sun bright even in the thick of night. In this odd and unforgettable place, Herzog has made his own poetry."
1,"A poem of oddness and beauty. Herzog is like no other filmmaker, and to return to him is to be welcomed into a world vastly larger and more peculiar than the one around us. The underwater photography alone would make a film, but there is so much more."
1,Herzog is one of a kind. His new doc is an event you watch in awe as you marvel at its wonders.
1,
1,"Seemingly off-hand, cumulatively imposing, utterly masterful."
1,"As a nature doc alone, Encounters at the End of the World would stand as one of the year's best. But it is the people who choose to live and work at the very ends of the Earth that are Herzog's real subject."
1,"It's a thoroughly intelligent, worthwhile and tremendous-looking film. But where is the dark spark of Herzog magic?"
1,"Almost every film Werner Herzog makes is savage and incisive. Encounters at the End of the World, far-out and unforgettable."
1,"As a nature documentary it's nothing special. But that was never the intent. As an observational study of people and place, it's truly fascinating."
1,A compelling film that is by turns thought-provoking and very funny.
1,"This is Herzog in awe at life, the universe, eternity itself."
1,"The film is beautifully shot both under the ice, where creatures roam in a place that would rival any sci-fi horror."
0,"This documentary about life in and around a vast scientific research centre in Antarctica. None of these meetings, however, is as interesting as the interspersed footage of the pole's natural wonders."

1,The mesmerizing performance of [Elle] Fanning as the gifted and troubled young Phoebe sparks the picture.
0,"Barnz arbitrarily posits a nonsensical series of school ""rules"" to embody conformity, while imagination is repped by Tourette syndrome."
1,"The performances are transcendent -- especially Fanning's, as the little girl who wants to get better, who wants to be better, as she slowly disappears through the Looking Glass."
0,"Unfortunately, the film is insultingly soft in its portrayal of neurological disorders, linking the disease to Phoebe's fanciful conversations with characters from Alice in Wonderland."
0,"Phoebe appears to have obsessive-compulsive disorder (or something), but Phoebe in Wonderland is so intent on celebrating her as 'special' that it quirks up the trauma of her issues."
1,"Phoebe in Wonderland gradually loses its grip on tone and believability, climaxing with a show-must-go-on moment that's just plain silly. Thankfully, Barnz knows exactly where to end his film: on the face of a girl, and an actress, at the crossroads."
1,"For all its cop-outs, Phoebe still trumps the 'how to be a better person' hoo-hah of so many middlebrow dramas, if only because the problems it depicts are real, not overcooked reactions to trumped-up traumas."
1,[Elle Fanning is] an astonishingly natural and unmannered actress who carries this rather ungainly movie on her narrow shoulders.
1,"Barnz has made a poignant family movie that, despite its thematic material and brief profanity, is appropriate for mature 10-year-olds and older."
1,Let Clarkson and Fanning take you to the rabbit hole of seductive enchantment that defines this movie.
1,It's a rare thing when a labor of love turns out to be worth both the labor and the love.
0,"Writer-director Daniel Barnz manages to achieve a true and delicate balance for much of Phoebe in Wonderland, his first feature, but ultimately undermines himself with heavy-handed and rather hackneyed whimsy."
1,"The screenplay is unusual in its reliance on children for many of the scenes, and its understanding of the drama in the heart of a troubled 9-year-old."
0,It leaves you frustrated and annoyed.
1,"An uneven, unfocused amalgamation of ideas and moods that is at times deeply moving nonetheless."
0,"It's that kind of movie, full of therapeutic notions paraded as poetry and scenes that seem to carry explanatory labels."
0,"Elle Fanning, and her audience, deserve better."
0,It needs the power of imagination to be done effectively and I just didn't think it was here.
1,"I thought this was delightful, a little depressing at times but with three stellar performances from Fanning, Huffman, and Patricia Clarkson."
0,There's a lot more perspiration than inspiration.
1,"Though Phoebe is nearly too dark for children and nearly too simple for adults, it succeeds as a swirling reminder of what it felt like to get lost in imagination"
0,Viewers who don't loathe it immediately may find it the guilty pleasure of the season.
0,As thoroughly generic as its title.
1,"A muckraking documentary of vast shuddery intrigue, makes a disquieting case that Russia hasn't just slipped back to its old oligarchic ways -- but that, in fact, it's a more repressive, corroded place than it was in the age of the Soviet Union."
0,"A film that does an injustice to the whole chaotic situation in Eastern Europe by making it seem not just impossible, but impenetrable."
1,"Although a first-rate investigative documentary on its own, Andrei Nekrasov's Poisoned by Polonium also serves as a sequel to 2004's Disbelief."
0,"The film, instead of confining itself to who Litvinenko was and how he came to be killed, wanders off into too many tangents and mentions too many cases. The epic corruption of today's Russia is far too widespread to fit into a single film."
0,"... no crackerjack action flick but rather a dizzying, unfocused and, frankly, dull assemblage of revelations and denials."

0,"The Wolfman ends up a disappointment, then, somewhat interesting in places, but nothing to howl about."
0,Not so much howlingly bad as it is disappointingly lifeless.
0,"""Why so serious?"" would be an excellent question to direct at the makers of The Wolfman, a high-toned, bloody but otherwise bloodless effort."
1,"Del Toro gives his least mumbly performance in years, Blunt provides the film with a little heart and Hopkins delivers the laughs."
0,"There's more emotion in the monster's howls, which were created by a baritone opera singer, than in Del Toro's monotone mutterings."
0,"Johnston sacrifices originality for computer graphics and stop-motion camera tricks, and the script, by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self, bulges with real howlers: ""I didn't know you hunted monsters."" ""Sometimes monsters hunt you!"""
0,"The violence is horrific, but it's not scary."
0,It doesn't know whether it wants to be dark and moodily glamorous or ridiculous and gory -- it's a creature feature suffering from extreme class consciousness.
0,A film that begins in an eerie gothic mist of suggestion-and turns into a toothless exercise in the obvious.
0,"The title character in The Wolfman suffers from a vexing identity crisis, and so does the movie."
0,"The Wolfman bites, but not -- I think -- in the way the filmmakers intended."
1,"When the beast is finally revealed, he's fearsome. Too bad the story's not."
0,"There's not much to recommend this dull, cheerless and not very scary re-imagining of the classic 1941 film."
0,"The Wolfman is hardly O'Neill, but it always had subtexts of alpha-male dominance, sexual repression, compulsive behavior and father-son feuds. Johnston runs so fast away from all of it you'd think it was wolfsbane."
1,"A misty, moody Saturday-matinee monster-chiller-horror special that hits the same sweet spot for moviegoers of a certain age (cough) as those snap-together Frankenstein model kits from the late 1960s."
0,"A few stray livers and severed heads aside, this is a monster too polite for its own good."
0,There's a dispiritingly rote and uninvolving air about The Wolfman that keeps the movie from being the slightest bit frightening for anyone old enough to see it.
1,"There's a lot to appreciate in the shaggy, imperfect but still fun new version of The Wolf Man."
0,Neither scary enough to be exciting nor campy enough to be amusing.
1,"Compared to Van Helsing, this is fairly satisfying."
1,"The Wolfman constitutes a pleasant surprise, if ""pleasant"" can be used to describe a brooding $100 million-+ diversion with this many beheadings and eviscerations."
0,"In any event, The Wolfman makes a satisfactory date movie for Valentine's Day, which is more than can be said for Valentine's Day."
1,"Actors fulminate and masticate, spit, scowl and sob; what a gas it is to watch them overact with joy and conviction."
0,"An ill-considered, utterly unnecessary remake."
1,"The Wolfman, hokey and uneven though it is, [has] the kind of authentic emotional hook that too many horror movies today don't have."
0,Benicio Del Toro pulls off a nifty trick in The Wolfman: He makes turning into a werewolf look as dull as doing your taxes.
0,Anthony Hopkins portrays Sir John Talbot. Benicio Del Toro is prodigal son Lawrence. That's a great deal of acting sinew for an oddly anemic outing.
1,"Consider The Wolfman a pedigreed genre yarn, mindful of its precedents but nimble enough to have a good time in the here and now."
1,It's exactly what it's supposed to be: an upscale goth B-movie with dark humor and buckets of blood.
0,"While it's sleeker and more sophisticated than the Chaney version, this new Wolfman isn't any scarier."
0,"Like buffalo meat, The Wolfman is a little too lean for its own good."
0,The root problem with The Wolfman is that it's a hybrid. It tries to fuse the gothic storytelling of the original with the violence and gore associated with modern horror.
0,This Wolfman is a howler but not in a good way.
1,To say there is nothing new about The Wolfman is to miss the fact that this is its charm.
1,"With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original."
0,"Del Toro looks about as dangerous as an urban fox snoozing in a compost bin and Blunt seems to be suffering from some residual Victorian queenliness. Looking in the mirror afterwards, I seemed pale from weariness."
0,"The Wolfman delivers plenty of scares and an abundance of eviscerations, but director Joe Johnston doesn't take the film anywhere unexpected."
1,Digital delirium makes up for lack of plot novelty.
0,"The magic appears to have deserted Mr Baker, because at the appearance of the hirsute fiend what I heard in the stalls wasn't gasps of horror but giggles of mirth."
0,"The problem with this modern version of the old tale, however, is that it's basically a load of codswallop we can no longer swallow without choking."
1,This is the rare blockbuster that offers its characters - and its audience - no shelter.
1,As surprising as it is delicious with an indelible performance by new star Sally Hawkins.
1,"As usual, Leigh's trademark extended rehearsal process pays off with vivid characterizations from ensemble cast."
1,"In the factory-farmed blandness of the movies, Happy-Go-Lucky has a strong, real taste."
1,A delightful comedy that sinks its teeth into your heart with unexpected power.
1,"A light-hearted look at a free spirit, with some funny and thought-provoking moments."
1,"An improvisational comedy drama, it's very funny and establishes Hawkins as a major talent to watch."
1,"It's a funny film - a surprise perhaps after 'Vera Drake' - and, crucially, it aches with truth."
1,"At 65, director Mike Leigh proves an old dog can turn new tricks."
1,"The movie isn't witty or memorable, but it keeps you on edge, and it's the first war-on-terror film to weave its anti-U.S. politics so deeply into the narrative that the characters don't need to speechify."
1,Happy-Go-Lucky is triumphant proof that a creative middle way is always possible.
1,The sunshiny primary-school teacher nicknamed Poppy (Sally Hawkins) in Mike Leigh's exuberant comedy Happy-Go-Lucky is the kind of relentless optimist one might worry about in real life.
1,"We take Mike Leigh's gifts for granted, knowing the collaborative nature of his filmmaking will inevitably produce something brimming with humanity. Yet what the director and cast do with this character study is miraculous."
1,"At the very least, the spectacle of Poppy's devotion and desire, not to mention her all-around sunny disposish, left this viewer feeling unaccountably happy -- at least for the moment."
1,"The opening scenes of Mike Leigh's latest slice-of-life dramedy Happy-Go-Lucky introduce a protagonist who appears psychologically disordered at worst, and highly annoying at best."
1,Poppy is upbeat ??so relentlessly upbeat that it won't take long before you're wondering just how the director plans to wipe the smile off her face.
0,"The trouble is that the movie in which Poppy does, in fact, exist never quite rises to her level."
1,"Writer-director Leigh, maintaining a deceptively freewheeling tone throughout, creates a comedy that's also something much more."
1,"The buoyant tone of Leigh's latest, Happy-Go-Lucky, is such an unexpected and welcome change-of-pace. For his part, Leigh is just as grumpy as ever, but he has produced a motion picture that can best be described as optimistic."
1,"It is a decidedly clear-eyed exploration of the challenges of being happy. And, as such, it's both an enjoyable comedy and a fascinating character study."
1,"The key to enjoying the film, a minor effort by Leigh, is warming up to Poppy. Her bubbly personality may be too much for some. She's like a walking, talking smiley face."
1,A picture so seemingly light that it might be hours (or even days) before you realize how deep and rich it really is.
1,No list of the year's best performances should be made without [Sally Hawkins].
1,"Happy-Go-Lucky ultimately charms -- just like its dizzy, disarming heroine."
1,"Poppy, memorably played by Sally Hawkins, is one of those individuals who sees every glass as half-full."
1,"Is it possible to enjoy the company of the world's most irritating woman? Mike Leigh's surprisingly sunny dramedy makes a pretty good case that, in fact, it is."
1,The way these two characters react to each other while staying completely in character displays Leigh's method the way nothing else can.
1,I don't know how Mike Leigh does it.
1,"Happy-Go-Lucky is closely tuned to the pulse of communal life, to the rhythms of how people work, play and struggle together."
1,
1,"It's a small, radiant gem in a movie season cluttered with rhinestones. You leave the theater feeling both clearheaded and buoyant."
1,"The British actress Sally Hawkins delivers a nervy, utterly captivating tour de force performance in Happy-Go-Lucky, Mike Leigh's transporting new film."
1,"Coming from the man who made his name as a director of often grim social-realist films such as Vera Drake, All or Nothing and Secrets & Lies, Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky strikes one as a film fantasy."
1,"Happy-Go-Lucky isn't one of Leigh's epic social canvases like Secrets & Lies or even Topsy-Turvy; rather, it's an edgy character study whose message only gradually emerges."
1,"As refreshing as it is to find a movie that leaves you smiling, it's something much rarer to discover a film that makes you think about what a commitment to happiness really means."
1,Oddball and ingenious.
1,"Sally Hawkins been in movies before, including Leigh's ""Vera Drake"" and Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's Dream,"" but this is her star-making role. She was named best actress at Berlin 2008. I will deliberately employ a cliche: She is a joy to behold."
1,"Expertly directed by Mike Leigh, Happy-Go-Lucky is not only joyous but substantial."
1,"Mr. Leigh has executed a richly exuberant entertainment for our troubled times, and deserves still another of my honorary Oscars for his astoundingly skillful effort."
1,"The new Mike Leigh film, Happy-Go-Lucky, is a real pleasure, and besides being Leigh's most buoyantly comic feature it's a marvelous showcase for Sally Hawkins, who has worked twice before with the British writer-director."
1,"Happy-Go-Lucky doesn't provide many insights (even Poppy seems ultimately unsure about whether happiness can be a permanent condition), but it does provide a little joy -- and that's worth celebrating, at the movies and elsewhere."
1,"The intentions of this oddity are muddled, but the small portraits of ordinary people choosing their path through the daily range of depression and delight are fully alive."
1,"Leigh pushes the story in a more interesting direction, asking whether people find happiness or simply will it on themselves."
1,It's a powerful argument for optimism.
1,"I've never used this clich in a review before, and God forbid I ever use it again, so pay close attention: Happy-Go-Lucky is the feel-good movie of the year."
1,"Sally Hawkins, in a blinding, Oscar-worthy piece of acting so good you barely see it, plays Poppy, a perpetually upbeat elementary schoolteacher in London."
1,"Hawkins wears her grin in almost every scene, but she gives us hints that this dizzy 30-year-old is deep, as are the disappointments that might have caused Poppy to don this mask. It's a performance of sustained, childlike wonder and adult wit."
1,
1,"Faithful to those cult-adored obscurities in nearly every detail, including their soporific pace. Here, however, sly in-jokes come often enough to make said pacing funny in itself."
1,Its triumph is that of style -- gloriously and revoltingly tacky style -- over substance.
0,Anna Biller's pseudofeminist send-up of the sexploitation movies of the late '60s and early '70s remains as limp as the flaccid dongs at her film's nudist sing-along.
0,For fans of the work of Charles Busch and other like-minded spoofs only.
1,"Anna Biller's debut feature Viva consciously combines elements of all of the above, offering a painstaking recreation of the look and feel of campy retro sexploitation."
0,"The campy early '70s is the goofy gift that keeps on giving in Viva, a mock soft-core sexploitation film that gets a lot right but forgets that less is often more, especially in plaid."
1,A startlingly pitch-perfect reproduction of the kind of gauzy sex movies from the 1960s and early 1970s that preceded the hard-core revolution.
1,The movie pops with parodic joy--in the hoary double-entendres and presentational acting styles--and hotly lighted 35-millimeter cinematography that evokes lounge music album covers and Playboy ads.
1,"It takes skill -- a certain sly, even perverse nimbleness of craft -- to make an homage to schlock movies that treats them as works of art. Viva, written and directed by its star, Anna Biller, could just about be the third featurette in Grindhouse."
1,"With its copious nudity and zipless hedonism, Viva, though unduly long, is a crafty reminder of a time when the X rating was flaunted, not feared."
0,You can't create camp on purpose.
0,The movie isn't comfortable or wholly successful.
1,"At an epic two hours the stilted dialogue and eye-scorchingly oversaturated film stock threaten to test the patience. But as a self-conscious exercise in kitsch graverobbing, 'Viva' succeeds."
0,It's the sort of attention to detail that would be admirable in a short film. But in a film that plays out at two hours it's unendurable. Paying ironic homage to bad cinema doesn't suddenly make it good.
0,"Where her film lets itself down, though, is it's simply not funny; you assume that a certain kind of hipster audience may be tickled by all this, but the laughs will be as forced as those that bray out of the screen at all too regular intervals."
1,"The acting is as subtly, drolly bad as it needs to be. The hairpieces and cheesy background muzak compete for the honour of perfect finishing touch. At two hours Viva is a mite too long. But summer is here: give genius its leash."
1,Anna Biller's pastiche of '70s sexploitation flicks finds its G-spot somewhere in the space between past misogyny and present feminism. It's a transgressive joy - if somewhat overlong.
0,"Reported parallels with the Marquis de Sade's Justine just don't wash. It's more like Russ Meyer, except the jugs on view aren't as big."
1,"The movie wears out its welcome long before it meanders to a close at 121 minutes. But as a kinky costume party it's watchable, if only for the smutty sex scenes and Biller's bold pop-art decor."
1,"Holding its hallucinatory blend of archival footage, animation and skewed recreations of scenes from Maddin's childhood together is the director's inspired, entertaining narration."
1,"Deep, rich sound accompanies distressed, often unfocused black-and-white shots of nighttime winter streets, garishly lit interiors and archival footage. Splashes of color in cut-out animation segs add to the texture."
1,"Ingeniously madcap and heartfelt... more than just a whimsical curiosity, My Winnipeg takes an extraordinary leap forward..."
1,"This tongue-in-cheek ""docu-fantasia"" about the hold his snowbound Manitoba hometown has over him is weird, winning and hilarious."
1,"My Winnipeg is overloaded and digressive -- it comes with the territory -- but it's also grounded in a place, Maddin's Manitoban hometown, and it's painfully engrossing."
1,"My Winnipeg is Maddin's best filmmaking since the not-dissimilar confessional bargain-basement phantasmagoria, Cowards Bend the Knee. The editing is dense; the action is fluid."
1,"In the bizarre and singularly delightful My Winnipeg, [director Guy] Maddin offers a docu-history of his hometown, entangled with memories of his childhood."
1,An entrancing riffle through the olde curiosity shoppe of the filmmaker's psyche.
1,"My Winnipeg, which combines archival documentary images with freshly shot passages, is more concerned with lyrical truth than with literal accuracy."
1,"Guy Maddin's films are always delightful, but his latest, My Winnipeg, has an added treat for film buffs: It features Ann Savage!"
1,"You're unlikely to find an easier entry into Maddin's wild world than this black-and-white 'docu-fantasia', a dryly funny, cheerfully false autobiography."
1,A movie that is as happily warped and enthusiastically disturbed as the rest of [director Guy] Maddin's eccentric cinema.
1,"The film, shot in black and white, like most of Maddin's creations, is a treat for fans and a migraine for the uninitiated or terminally dull."
1,"This haunting phantasmagoria of a film -- comic, singular, surreal -- is not only something no one but the Canadian director could have made, it's also a film no one else would have even wanted to make. Which is the heart of its appeal."
1,"This autobiographical meditation is seductively funny, as well as deliciously strange, and hauntingly beautiful, as well as stream-of-consciousness cockeyed."
1,My Winnipeg is like no documentary you've ever seen.
1,"An unhinged, utterly delightful 'documentary'."
1,"For the uninitiated, I heartily recommend this free-associative, autobiographical gem."
1,"Much of what Maddin asserts as truth is balderdash. He was not, for example, born in the locker room of the local hockey team's arena."
1,The world would be a better place if every city had its Maddin.
1,"In the narration Maddin claims that Winnipeg has ten times as many sleepwalkers as any other city in the world, and though he's surely making this up, it conveys his own sense of entrapment amid the town's dreaminess."
1,"If you love movies in the very sinews of your imagination, you should experience the work of Guy Maddin."
1,"My Winnipeg is a mobile collage, and its assemblage is fascinating."
1,"An affecting, dreamy, Chris Marker-esque, cin챕-essay."
1,"This is a secret history, and it's a wonder."
1,The best way to take My Winnipeg is with a box of popcorn and a grain of salt.
1,"Maddin is a real film-maker with a confident, fluent movie language that is evolving in fascinating directions."
1,"Guy Maddin docu about his hometown gives fans everything they'd expect, + a few moments of unexpected sincerity."

0,"While candy-colored graphics should dazzle kids, Space Chimps has little draw for audiences spoiled by the Pixar-given knowledge that CGI can entertain -- and not just stupefy -- moviegoers of any age."
1,It'll keep the kids entertained for a while and give their parents a chuckle or two along the way.
0,As light as a banana souffle and about as substantial.
0,[It's] like they ran out of the $292.96 budget halfway through.
0,Space Chimps sucks a whole lot of talented people into a wormhole of lousy.

1,"The CG animation is nothing special, but the characters are surprisingly fun and the story is full of enough puns, wordplay and slapstick to elicit laughs from across the age spectrum."
0,"Worse are the chimps themselves. Their bodies are realistic in all the wrong ways, with grotesque appendages and unpleasantly textured fur, while the expressions on their unadorable mugs are entirely devoid of humanity."
1,Space Chimps is delightful from beginning to end: A goofy space opera.
1,"Journalism is all about having the courage to write the truth even if it will get you mocked by your relatives and co-workers, so here goes: Space Chimps is hilarious."
1,"I have to admit, there's a sort of dopey, cute, harmless charm to this movie. It actually doesn't stink."
0,This banana-brained picture doesn't deliver. Parents will prefer shuttling everyone to a second showing of WALL-E.
0,"The film is pacy, full of humour rather than thrills and not too long. Not for connoisseurs of animation but fun for the young."
1,"It may look half-finished, but it's bright and silly and passes the time."
0,Space Chimps isn't so terrible - unashamed kids stuff that addresses no bigger question than how to pee in a space suit.
0,"Unfortunately, the film-makers assume that pre-adolescent audiences will only identify with a smug, hyperactive central character such as the Andy Samburg-voiced Ham. Still, it's remarkable that they managed to smuggle an oral sex joke into a U-rated film"
0,"Coupling the men-on-a-mission antics of 'Armageddon' with the catch-all sci-fi pastiche of TV's 'Futurama', 'Space Chimps' is an underwhelming slice of lowbrow CGI entertainment."
1,"A movie called Space Chimps ought to be cheap, crude and silly, and this computer-animated lark delivers on all fronts."

0,"Seriously, I'm astonished that anybody would try to pass this movie off as artistically or socially meaningful in 2007."
1,"Fanning projects a strange mix of innocence and awareness. The triumph of her performance is her ability to turn it on and off in the same scene, sometimes even in the same shot."

1,Vera Farmiga's fearlessly committed turn as a woman caught off-guard by her own desires and Kim's highly sensitive camera turn the film into a chamber-piece of hushed eroticism and surprising narrative grip.
1,Floridly plotted but acutely detailed.
1,What holds together the pulp of this torn-between-two-lovers fantasy is a restrained and elegant cinematic aesthetic.
0,Writer-director Gina Kim channels Douglas Sirk by way of Korean tearjerkers of the 1960s in this overheated melodrama.
1,"While Never Forever lingers in the thick of sex, lies and anxiety, it is something to see."
1,Farmiga elevates the material of this melodramatic soaper into something nearly profound.
1,Never Forever has the steaminess of pulp and the stateliness of art.
0,It's like a Lana Turner vehicle that's too meek to be Last Tango in Chinatown.
1,"If Adrian Lyne directed a racy Lifetime movie, then asked Danielle Steel what to call it, you'd pretty much have Never Forever, a sudsy chamber piece that's engrossing despite its many plot holes and contrivances."
1,Vera Farmiga is the best American actress you've never heard of.
1,"The sweetest, most sincere romantic comedy to come along in ages, and a luminous love letter to a great American city."
1,"The dialogue is fresh-prince clever, the themes are ageless, the rhythms are riotous and the return to a primal animation style is beautifully executed."
1,"Where Pinocchio was about wishing on a star, The Princess and the Frog emphasizes backing up wishes with hard work. That proviso is a thoughtful message for young moviegoers."
1,"This is the first Disney animated film about an African-American princess, and this delightful fairy tale couldn't come at a better time, what with the two little African-American princesses who live in the White House."
1,This is the best Disney animated film in years.
1,"This A-level, G-rated entertainment is a fresh twist on the classic fairy tale."
0,This long-anticipated throwback to a venerable house style never comes within kissing distance of the studio's former glory.
1,"The first real addition to its princess lineup in 15 years, and the studio's biggest non-CG animated movie half a decade, it also belatedly brings racial diversity to a signature genre that's been mostly snow white for six decades."
0,"It's not easy being green. But to judge from how this hand-drawn movie addresses, or rather strenuously avoids, race, it is a lot more difficult to be black."
1,"Disney Animation is back doing what it does best -- musical romantic adventure with magic -- after 10 years of unfortunate forays into barnyard humor and science fiction (see the same directors' Treasure Planet or, better yet, don't.)"
0,"The movie as a whole never approaches the wit, cleverness, and storytelling brio of the studio's early-1990s animation renaissance."
1,"It's gaily colored, handmade art, with a straight stylistic link to old Baby-Boom offerings of the '50s and '60s."
0,"Eye-candy-wise, the film plants a big wet smooch; everything else about this happily-ever-after tale, however, feels like a mere air-kiss."
1,"""You can't just wish on a star,"" advises Tiana, and with that, Disney makes amends for three generations of mealy indoctrination."

1,A start-to-finish delight.
1,"Ron Clements and John Musker deliver a satisfying gumbo of snappy dialogue, lovable characters and bright-hued images, spiced up with just the right touch of voodoo peril."
1,Dependably charming and enjoyable.
1,"The smart storytelling combines with spectacular visual set pieces and a spicy musical gumbo to deliver one of the finest films of the year, in any genre."
1,"For the most part, it's a winner: spirited, funny and even complex in a way that's been foreign to recent Disney cartoons."
1,"With eye-popping saturated color and streamlined figures, codirectors Ron Clements and John Musker (the duo behind the vibrant Aladdin) lovingly invoke Harlem Renaissance artistry."
0,"It's a worthy cause and an honorable film, the first full-length Disney cartoon with an African-American heroine. But without a strong story, it's a case of one step forward and two steps back."

0,"The animation in The Princess and the Frog is beautifully rendered, and the movie doesn't lack for energy. But this is minor Disney at best, forgettable at worst..."
1,This is what classic animation once was like! No 3-D! No glasses! No extra ticket charge! No frantic frenzies of meaningless action! And...good gravy! A story! Characters! A plot!
1,It's nice to know that the studio behind Cinderella can still cast a spell in two dimensions.
1,"Randy Newman provides the score, which, if short of memorable tunes, is rich in authenticity, with a mixture of local flavoured ragtime, zydeco and jazz."
1,"Efficient, well-practiced storytelling is what we expect from a Disney animated feature. The real story here for parents is the clever and careful recalibration of the princess archetype."
1,An instant if minor classic.
1,The visual artistry of the song-and-dance numbers captivates.
1,Disney's The Princess and the Frog is an instant classic and one of the year's best films.
0,"The way she resists the fantasy formula is admirable, but ultimately (and disappointingly) futile."
1,"Light on its feet, confident and modern, it's the work of a company hungry for respect and eager to remind moviegoers of its enchanting roots."
1,You can exhale now: The Princess and the Frog is a triumph on every one of the myriad levels it has been asked to succeed on.
1,"The Princess and the Frog is so in synch with the early entries into Disney's so-called ""second golden age"" that one wonders how the company could have gotten away from these movies in the first place."
1,A lovely toon destined to join the Mouse House's best-loved classics.
0,"Most of The Princess and the Frog looks more like one of Disney's straight-to-DVD sequels than like their animated classics, and the few big, fun musical set-pieces are brought down by second-rate songwriting."
1,"Disney are back doing hand drawn animation, and despite a slightly stuttering start to shake off the cobwebs, they're still doing it very well."
1,"Randy Newman's songs are a little too blandly Randy Newman-ish and the story is uneven, but there are some great characters, some even better jokes, a general sense of good humour and that entrancing, eye-ravishing old-school animation."
1,The closest yet that Disney's traditional 2-D animation has come to threatening the supremacy of the computer-generated Pixar-style tales.
0,"Disney may wish to reach out to people of colour - but the colour green wasn't what we had in mind. It's a moderate film, nowhere near the Toy Story league."
1,"Intermittently appealing and great to look at, this doesn't add up to classic Disney, but it's heaps better than the gruesome Home on the Range, which looked to be the last gasp of these old-style toons. It proves there's life in dem bones yet."
1,New Orleans is as exhaustively filled-in as Pixar's imagined worlds.
1,Disney have turned the funeral march for old-school animation into a jolly hand-crafted pageant that shows vibrant signs of life even in the age of Avatar.
1,"This has a lot to commend it, and it isn't just nostalgia for the Disney past. It's a visual treat."
1,"It's a very cute film, a very accessible work for children and families."
1,"The nineteen-twenties jazz-age setting and the primal-adventure storytelling are boilerplate Disney, scrubbed clean of any real local color."
1,"The backgrounds are beautifully drawn. There are sunny days in the French Quarter, spooky nights among live oaks hung with Spanish moss, and a rousing denouement at the Mardi Gras."
1,"If the film boasts any advantages over digital, it's in the pastel richness of its colours and the elasticity of its characters, who enjoy a degree of comic flexibility and range of expressions we still don't get from computers."
1,"his sense of unpredictability, coupled with some breathlessly paced and visually stunning action scenes, makes this the animated success of 2009... at least until Up opens next month."
1,A nice turn from Mr. T keeps the grade (barely) above C level.
1,"A delicious farce and a backhanded slap at America the Obese, it may be the funniest animated film of the year."
1,"It may not have the heart or subtle artistry of Up, but then again, Pixar's 3-D outing didn't feature a mustache-tearing monkey, a manchild encased in a giant cooked chicken, or a beefy, bounding cop voiced by Mr. T."
0,"This computer-animated 3D extravaganza is the ultimate food fight, capitalizing on the universal compulsion to play with your food. But like any good food fight, it offers short-lived entertainment."
1,"If you ever thought a marshmallow might make a fine crispy torch, or you've wondered what it would be like to luxuriate in a Jell-O palace, or you've imagined a ""snow day"" with ice-cream snowballs, you'll find kindred spirits here."
1,"Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have written an engaging and comically absurd story with subtle messages, more sophisticated than what usually is offered in animated fare."
1,Lord and Miller know how to play with their food -- they have a hunger for the whimsical detail
1,Second-string animated movie makes it to the finish line.
1,"Eye-popping and mouth-watering in one, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs spins a 30-page children's book into a 90-minute all-you-can-laugh buffet."
1,One of the most visually creative movies of the year. The film combines a pinch of morality with a healthy dose of humor to produce a movie that's entertaining for everyone.
1,The psychedelic-era Beatles would have loved this film.
0,"It seemed to me the mountains of fudge, ice cream and pancakes overshot the mark and looked silly, and the airborne food cast a pall over the city, but by golly those kids are plucky."
1,"Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, whose television credits include CBS' How I Met Your Mother, pack each scene with jokes big and small, and the voice cast shines..."
1,"So what could be better than an endless supply of jellybeans and ice cream? Only a multiplex permanently stocked with smart, sweetly silly family films like this one."
0,It takes an iron stomach to watch this stuff and not feel nauseated.
0,No comedy should come bogged down with so many Important Life Lessons.
1,"Food has never been funnier than it is in the spirited, animated family film Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."
1,"But it's fun, it has some good messages and what kid won't enjoy seeing pancakes flatten a roof and an ice-cream blizzard that you can eat while you play in it? Especially when it's presented in colorful 3-D splendor?"
1,"This film wasn't made for you, or me. It was made for dangerously easily distracted 9-year-olds. And at least the never-enough aesthetic extends to its sheer, Augustus Gloop volume of sight gags."
1,"It's not especially filling, but it leaves a pleasant aftertaste."
1,"It flits swiftly between easy-but-funny sight gags involving giant food, send-ups of disaster-film clich챕s, and endearing characters brought vividly to life by a pleasing visual style, + funny vocal performances."
1,It's nice that the film brings some real-world crunch to the story - ethnic characters whose presence make a social point ... and a clear message about the downside of a society where food is overabundant.
0,"... a well-intentioned children's film that has the unfortunate effect of making food, all food, seem utterly revolting. It's the gastronomical version of 'Scared Straight!' 3-D."
1,"As a hyperbolic expos챕 of unnatural obesity and environmental destruction, in many ways this serves as an unacknowledged prequel to the post-apocalyptic nightmare envisaged in Wall-E. Chew (and choke) on that!"
1,"'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' may not scale the artistic heights of a 'Finding Nemo' or 'Wall-E', but it's the most satisfying and original non-Pixar CG animated movie to hit screens in a while."
1,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs lacks the charm of some other recent offerings in this genre, but it has enough grown-up gags to keep the adults amused and their children will laugh themselves silly."
1,"A veritable buffet of the bland and the bizarre, the sweet and the sour, and all tastes are catered for along the way."
0,The animated movie greatly expands on the kids' book on which it's based in a clever and engaging first half. But the second half leaves a foul aftertaste. Slapdash action scenes play against dreary warnings to fear wealth and beauty.
1,This is a sweet morsel that's good for your health. Fight the power and tuck in.
1,Hungry for some good old family-friendly entertainment? Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs should fit the bill of fare.
0,The film continues in meal-monsoon mode for 90 minutes with scant variation.
1,"If the filmmakers opt to make only light statements about junk food, obesity and solid waste, they at least leave the audience sated on a single serving of inspired lunacy."
1,"What an unexpected treat this turns out to be - as messy and riotous as a kindergarten food- fight, with teacher tied up in the corner."
1,"It's not The Incredibles, but it has a solid gag ratio and good animation (the spaghetti tornado is spectacular)."
0,"Determined to have their cake and eat it too, writer-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller first invite us to revel in ice cream mountains and nacho cheese fountains, then clobber us with ham-handed nutritional moralism."
1,"Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is visually inventive and exuberant, and has some neat running gags. But its characterisations are a little disappointing."
1,This 3D cartoon based on the popular children's book is sweet and fun -- not to mention a little trippy.
1,"As shot by the incomparable Ellen Kuras, the concert retains a rich organic feel, complementing the music without over-determining it."
1,Excellent concert docu revisits a neglected chapter in Reed's back catalog.
1,"A concert film by technicality, a cinematic trance in practicality."
1,One of the most fascinating performances of the year.
1,For Reed fans -- for rock fans -- the movie is an essential document of a noteworthy event.
1,This luminously shot concert movie reveals that Berlin is far from the lost masterpiece the movie wants it to be.
1,"Reed's dour, bombastic song-suite about the lives of the drug-addicted and downtrodden steadily acquired cult cachet over the decades, peaking with its staging as a complete-album concert in 2006, which Lou Reed's Berlin documents."
1,"Who could have guessed that nearly 35 years after its release, Lou Reed's once-reviled concept album Berlin would inspire a sold-out concert, shot with loving awe by Julian Schnabel?"
1,Your enjoyment will hinge entirely on whether you think the album is a masterpiece or a bore.
1,"For die-hard Reed fans, it's an invaluable document."
1,"In Julian Schnabel's grimly majestic concert film Lou Reed's Berlin, Mr. Reed wears the deadpan smirk of a Zen master who has endured punishing Buddhist training."
1,Those who admire Reed will find that Schnabel's film allows the music to speak for itself against its rather messy background.
0,It's Reed's gruff and tuneless delivery that challenges one's enjoyment.
0,"For devotees only, I'm guessing."
1,"Reed's unmistakable lilting groan has real pain in it, hinting at a real but undisclosed personal story behind the music."
1,A unique record of an artist's journey.
1,"The titular rocker-poet gets a suitable portrait in Steven Sebring's Patti Smith: Dream of Life, which runs radically against the grain of American-made pop music docs."
1,"Steven Sebring's gorgeous, up-close-and-personal doc about the legendary rocker is both a journey into Smith's storied past and a portrait of her life today."
0,"Problem is, there's nary a hint of context, even with biographic essentials."
0,The opportunity to introduce newbies to a serious music-world icon -- and her significance -- feels squandered.
1,Frequently beautiful and intermittently haunting.
0,Even the crudest punk rocker learned three chords (Smith brags of having five) before they plugged in an amp. Steven Sebring would have done better to have had a few lessons in editing and structure before picking up his camera.
1,"A lovely, drifty first feature that feels less like a documentary and more like an act of rapturous devotion."
0,The film never penetrates beyond how Smith chooses to define herself. And the paltry amount of live performances is a crime.
1,"I imagine you could call Dream of Life a loving meditation on a one-of-a-kind performer. And you don't have to be a Smith fan (I am one, by the way) to enjoy."
1,Few documentaries about living artists get as deep into their subject's brain and heart as this one about the rock priestess and poetess.
1,"Dream of Life barely hints at the transformational energy that Smith exudes in person, but it does paint a portrait of a defiantly creative life."
1,"Patti Smith: Dream of Life, fashion photographer Steven Sebring's impressionistic study of the most influential of punk poets, disarms and charms with its honesty."
0,"If you don't already own ""Horses,"" this movie will make you want to go out and buy it. You'll also want to start surfing the Internet to fill in the blanks that Dream of Life fails to include."
1,"There's a note of mourning in this otherwise celebratory film -- for punk rock, for New York, for reality, for a time when popular music was animated by something other than money."
1,"That spirit of encountering the world with undying artistic curiosity -- and without a plan -- informs Dream of Life, a drifting portrait of Smith."
0,"For all its transient black-and-white beauties, denies its subject the sort of solid context that would reveal the scale of her achievements. A patchy, frustrating, though loving tribute."
1,"While it fails to place Smith's work and her significance in context, the film certainly captures her charisma, wit and passion."
1,"There are flashes of insight and genuinely moving moments in this long, meandering, wildly indulgent movie record of poet and singer-songwriter Patti Smith."
1,"Smith, an eloquent subject with a wry view on her life, generously pays tribute to such influential mentors as Dylan, Burroughs and Ginsberg. Her fans should be entranced."
1,Lakeview Terrace delivers fairly tense and engrossing drama before succumbing to thriller convention.
0,"Although LaBute has created memorably lacerating portraits of male cruelty and willful dominance, this one doesn't add up."
0,It's a shame that the later stages of Lakeview Terrace should overheat and spill into silliness.
0,"Unfortunately, Jackson is the best thing here.??The rest of Lakeview is cravenly engineered to make Wilson's squishy liberal hero a man, and the only surprise is that Neil LaBute directed it for hire."
1,"Well acted and tautly directed, it's a movie whose juice is its realism, the easily recognizable situation, the paranoia that any homeowner can identify with."
0,"Lakeview Terrace is gripping, ambitious and, by the time it ends, quite stupid."
1,"Mr. LaBute has fashioned a suspenseful film out of the peculiar vagaries of the casting, which makes us fear the worst at every turn of the plot."
0,Lakeview Terrace is obvious when you most want it to be stealth.
0,"As social commentary, it doesn't go deeply enough, and as a psychological thriller, it peters out in silliness."
0,"By the time the film's frantic, far-fetched climax comes along, Lakeview Terrace's pretense at exploring racial intolerance has been exposed for what it really is: a B-movie copout."
0,"When [director] LaBute pulls the grenade pin on racism and interracial relationships in Lakeview Terrace, viewers should know to duck and cover."
1,A slightly poky thriller punctuated by some effectively tense scenes.
0,It's too bad the movie's moderately intriguing qualities are buried under the final half-hour's avalanche of predictability.
1,The movie's premise is suitably nerve-wracking and hits close to home: Who hasn't had to deal with a slightly whacked neighbor at some time? The addition of the law-enforcement angle is a clever twist.
0,"Is this hell? Or a war zone? Maybe it's both, man. That's deep."
1,Lakeview Terrace is a serviceable enough popcorn exercise in a few floundering Angelenos who can't just get along.
0,The movie's only mark of restraint is the absence of an earthquake.
1,"Jackson hasn't had a role this good or this complex in many a moon, even if the rote ending betrays the complexity of the set-up."
0,A racial thriller that may be the feel-bad movie of the summer.
1,"In its overall shape and message, Lakeview Terrace is a conventional suspense thriller, but the details kick it up a notch."
1,"Lakeview Terrace [is] an unsettling address for everyone -- black, white or 'blue'."
1,"Lakeview Terrace holds your interest, though the bad faith on all sides makes it something of an endurance test."
0,Terrace pretends to be about the persecution of a mixed-race couple when really it's about how anyone might react living next door to the shark from Jaws.
0,"The movie is purportedly a thriller, a la Unlawful Entry or Pacific Heights, but the whole thing is so listless and mechanical, watching it is a curiously dispiriting experience."
1,"As Lakeview Terrace moves forward, it becomes clear this isn't a movie about the shuffling of black and white; it's a film about abusing power and desperately clinging to the status quo. It's a film about the fear of the future."
1,Lakeview Terrace's resistance to being one thing suggests the time has come when a movie featuring an interracial couple can no longer be merely about race and racism.
1,"This is being marketed as a slam-bang entertainment, but it's also one of the toughest and most relevant movies of the year."
0,"The movie might have something to say about black racism, but the conversations go nowhere, and the cliches of the genre take over."
1,"I find movies like this alive and provoking, and I'm exhilarated to have my thinking challenged at every step of the way."
0,"In its second half, Lakeview Terrace runs out of steam, culminating in a flatly directed climax, complete with halos of police lights, whirling helicopters and declamatory dialogue."
0,"Considered purely as a formal exercise, Lakeview Terrace is a passable piece of hackwork, with some adequately suspenseful passages."
0,"The actors make it watchable, but with these incendiary themes, 'watchable' isn't exactly a wildfire."
1,"The movie is directed by Neil LaBute, whose history suggests he's comfortable making his audience just uncomfortable enough to make a lasting impression."
1,"I found it scary at times and I was tense and I was on the edge of my seat, , but ultimately it did spiral out of control and get a little ridiculous."
0,The yawning chasm between the film's aspirations to social significance and its cheese-o-licious straight-to-video construction make it a chucklesome guilty pleasure.
1,"It's a terrifically unstable performance that is admirably matched by the exasperated victims. The ending is too allegorical for its own health, but this is intelligent cinema."
1,"From certain angles, Lakeview Terrace may look neurotic or even reactionary, but I found it bracingly tactless, particularly because interracial couples are still something of a taboo in modern Hollywood."
1,"Yet despite the crudeness that finally overtakes Lakeview Terrace, it may be a more accurate representation of racial attitudes in Los Angeles than many inhabitants would care to admit."
1,"But this cop, played with wicked finesse by Jackson while the script allows, deserves the chance to strut his hour in the smoke-free sun."
1,"Lakeside Terrace allows the antagonism to simmer just so, and then, regrettably, lets it boil over in a climax of gunplay and a swathe of Californian brush fires, perhaps the most crashingly symbolic conflagration since Apocalypse Now."
1,"Happily, it's not only a return to form for the one-time Mormon and agent provocateur, it also offers Samuel L Jackson his first decent part in years."

0,Quarantine fails to correct some of the problems evident in its predecessor while also incorporating a few defects of its own.
1,"No, the script isn't anything special and the novelty long ago wore off in this style of movie making. But the execution in this film from John Erick Dowdle is amazing, the camera work and cutting perfect."
0,"Quarantine is a modestly inventive, sporadically exciting thriller that nonetheless proves too faithful to its central conceit for its own good."
0,This derivative horror flick can be confined along with its numerous inspirations.
1,Quarantine director John Erick Dowdle and co-writing brother Drew wisely stick close to the told-from-the-cameraman's point-of-view template of the terrific original.
0,"Quarantine feels awfully familiar, and it grows less convincing with each passing moment. At its worst, it abandons realism entirely and flirts with gory kitsch."
0,"Quarantine is based on the 2007 Spanish thriller [REC]. Like any imitation, the quality's not as good, but this is about cheap thrills, of which there are not enough."
1,"Give Quarantine credit: Without resorting to computer-generated monsters or supernatural explanations, it uses consistent logic and confinement to find new ways of being scary."
1,"Quarantine, yet another pseudo-documentary horror movie, delivers the heebie-jeebies with solid acting and perfectly calibrated shocks."
0,"I have seen many execrable films -- Plan 9 From Outer Space, Disaster Movie, Batman & Robin -- but never has a movie made me so physically ill."
0,"An American remake of the Spanish horror movie '[Rec]' that adopts the same basic recipe, but removes any hint of flavour or texture, reducing cutting-edge Catalan cuisine to bland, bite-sized McNuggets."
1,Quarantine is a lucrative steal by Dowdle. The Spanish original is arguably the best v챕rit챕 fright movie since The Blair Witch Project. The American version is not quite in the same league.
0,"Good news for those who missed the Spanish zombie horror [REC] when it opened here a few months back. Here comes the inevitable fast-tracked Hollywood remake, which covers the same ground without the burden of all those subtitled hysterics."
0,The Spanish did it all a little better but Carpenter rivals her European counterpart in hollering blue murder.
0,"The camera bounces along, its path blocked frequently by the back of some fleeing figure, so that you're never quite sure where you are, where you're going or what you're looking at..."
1,Delivers a pleasingly high quota of decent jolts as the body count mounts and the TV airhead becomes increasingly hysterical.
1,
0,"Shame on the filmmakers for reducing one of the main characters to an incessantly whimpering, hyperventilating embodiment of fingernails on a chalkboard for what feels like the final third of the film."
1,
1,"This likeable, smart Danish drama about two aspiring writers has some of the arch, extra-dry-martini quality of a Whit Stillman film, including jumping locations and a dry, ironic voice-over."
1,"Trier's blend of genuine coolness, flesh-and-blood characters and a portrait of creative types that hits marrow, however, is a hat trick we'd gladly watch ad infinitum."
1,"Effervescent, if somewhat baggy in structure, dramedy Reprise reps an impressive debut for young Norwegian Joachim Trier."
1,"Trier justifies the boys' hardships with a bright and breezy detour through would-be glories. Altogether he crafts a striking portrait of the artist as a young brat, with the leads showing enough sensitivity to carry it off."
1,"It's a by-turns flip and searching cineaste's rites-of-passage drama -- both for the characters and the director -- that deals entertainingly with the rivalries, doubts, fears and sexual entanglements of its twentysomething milieu."
1,Form and content in perfect harmony.
1,This quick-witted film is likely to be a fleeting presence on our overcrowded screens. Catch it while you can.
1,"An exhilarating weave of childhood remembrance, projection, literary digression, and impish commentary."
1,"The vibrant Norwegian debut feature Reprise is one of those rare films about writers where form matches content, with fresh insights about the literary world coming via a complex, liberating series of flashbacks, ellipses, and other bold flourishes."
1,"[Director Joachim Trier] captures, in a way that's cool and romantic and heady, the moment in life when nothing matters more than ideas, influences and the possibility of shaping one's life into a work of art."
1,"Like his subjects, Norwegian writer-director Joachim Trier is young and bursting with ambition"
1,An intelligent and occasionally profound portrait of a pair of artists as young men.
1,As crisp and cool as a swig of Champagne.
1,"Trier's intent is to reproduce a sweet, hazy vision of the agony of youth. Ever so elliptically, he succeeds."
1,"[A] hilarious, smart and heartbreaking coming-of-age drama."
1,"It's a fine film by any standard, on any scale."
1,"An exuberant, exhilaratingly playful testament to being young and hungry 창"" for life and meaning and immortality, and for other young and restless bodies 창"" Reprise is a blast of unadulterated movie pleasure."
1,"The kind of discovery that comes along only a few times a year (if we're lucky), Joachim Trier's energetic, inventive debut takes such a novel approach to well-worn themes that it makes most movies look downright lazy."
1,A Norwegian movie that often looks and feels like a resurrected specimen of the French New Wave.
1,"They really get the young writers and that enthusiasm, but then also that heartbreak."
1,"A kinetic delight, Reprise comes from director Joachim Trier, born in Denmark but raised in Oslo, Norway, and it's a highlight of the filmgoing year so far."
1,Reprise has a smart and knowing script and will compel audiences to reflect on themselves at that age.
1,"Reprise, a vibrant new Norwegian film, burns with the passions of literature and youth."
0,"The cinema is an ideal medium for considering characters like those in ""Reprise,"" but you'd have to see Jules and Jim to find out why."
0,"The movie is enjoyable for its flashy surfaces--the witty editing, the narrative forecasting, the droll omniscient voice-over--but as drama it seems superficial."
1,"Drawing inspiration from the young-artists-in-angst tales of Godard, Truffaut and the French new wave, Joachim Trier's Reprise is both a charming homage and a vibrant work in its own right."
0,The jagged energy of this film's opening and closing moments leave you wondering where it might have gone and what it might have been.
1,"The word 'Reprise' may mean recurrence, but Trier's fleet, joyously intellectual film comes at us like anything but a retread."
1,"If you are young, male and dream of making a name for yourself in the arts, Reprise is about the joys and sufferings of that quest: It is a Jules and Jim for the punk-rock generation."
1,Reprise is not just about engaging with or surviving through the creative instinct. It is that instinct.
1,"This story about two aspiring writers in their early 20s has the fearlessness and vivacity of a first novel, and its playful approach to chronology and voice-over narration serves to amplify its themes instead of coming off as a show-off trick."

0,"The emotionally charged mysteries of his breakthrough feature, The Terrorist, have given way to laborious narrative convention in Indian helmer Santosh Sivan's latest, English-lingo period meller Before the Rains."
0,"Lacking the emotional power necessary to fuel its contrived plot elements, the film is a minor entry in the Merchant Ivory canon."
1,"Rahul Bose has a winning presence -- eager with a touch of wariness or wary with a touch of eagerness, and never entirely at home. He keeps the movie from seeming too comfy -- a good thing."
1,"The ingredients of the Indian director Santosh Sivan's period piece Before the Rains may be awfully familiar, but the film lends them the force of tragedy."
1,"Director Santosh Sivan imparts a vastness and a sense of wonder to the film, qualities reminiscent of a Thomas Cole painting: They remind you why the Brits thought conquering India was a good idea in the first place."
0,No amount of lingering shots of nature's rich pageant can make up for its lack of human involvement.
0,"Merchant-Ivory productions are usually visual delights, and Before the Rains is no exception. Pity that the direction and narrative lack passion. If there's anything a story of interracial adultery needs, it's passion."
0,So pretty and so utterly lifeless you can almost smell the embalming fluid coming off the screen.
1,"The film is well-acted, a broad colonial allegory, and again, visually gorgeous."
1,"A lovely, lyrical film with perfect timing that is a welcome relief from BlackBerrys, iPods, gas taxes, punk rock, the failing economy and the boredom of cutthroat election campaigns."
1,"Before the Rains is never less than compelling, but never more than adequately realized."
0,"With all these volatile emotions at play, Before The Rains should percolate like The Postman Always Rings Twice, but... well... it's a Merchant-Ivory production, after all."
0,"The problem isn't just that the material is cliched and vaguely offensive....It's more that the plot is incredibly predictable, the score is manipulative and the denouement completely unsatisfying."
0,"Producer Ismail Merchant died in 2005, but Merchant Ivory's stuffy tradition of quality lives on."
0,I can't quite recommend it.
0,"A predictable patchwork of forbidden romance, English arrogance, a gun given as a gift, suicide, corruption, deception, rising Indian nationalism and a short-lived chase through the jungle."
0,"Unfortunately, the parade of consequences brought on by the affair has little emotional substance."
0,It might have been more convincing if it had emphasized personalities rather than types.
1,"India has rarely looked so beautiful onscreen. Against the anguish of his human characters, director Santosh Sivan juxtaposes a tranquil, green world in the hills of the southwestern state of Keralain 1937, 10 years before independence."
0,"When the rains in Before the Rains finally arrive, there's nothing to cleanse, no real dirt to wash away -- not with history already so neatly packaged and polished to a dull shine."
1,"Acting honours go to Bose, his face an eloquently shifting register of shame, calculation and sympathy."
0,"The movie is prettily done in a fairly obvious way, but there's little insight into the emerging nationalist movement, which remains at best a shimmering backdrop in soft focus."
0,"The film is fervently acted and well shot, and Das provides a powerful, emotional force, but there is something a little clanky about the whole project..."
1,A brave new chapter in the Merchant Ivory story.

0,"The only things missing from this unfunny Campbell love fest are a passable script, Sam Raimi's inventiveness, and a level of sophistication beyond nose-picking."
0,"Willing as Campbell is to Shatner-ize himself, his movie will appeal only to true believers."
0,"While sporadically funny, the sophomoric My Name Is Bruce is no Bubba Ho-Tep."
0,The fact that My Name Is Bruce knows what it's doing doesn't mean it's funny.
0,"Preening and fleeing like a grunge-flick Bob Hope, Campbell's the whole show, but a little of his meta-referential shtick goes a long way."
1,Bruce is a thoroughly silly low-budget film made for people who revel in thoroughly silly low-budget films. Fanboys rejoice. Filmistas beware.
0,Low midrange in the Master's oeuvre.
0,Subtract Campbell from this movie's idiot-friendly equation and you've got just about any dimwitted horror comedy that's gone straight to video.
1,"Cheerfully embracing his status as cult B-movie genre megastar even as he sends it up, Bruce Campbell's sophomore directorial excursion, My Name is Bruce, is a big in-joke of definite if limited appeal."
0,Perhaps the best thing that can be said about My Name Is Bruce is that Bruce Campbell has in fact appeared in worse movies.
0,"Light as air, My Name Is Bruce is good for a mild chuckle, not a belly laugh. As any Campbell fan knows, managing expectations is key to getting the most from his work."
0,Add two stars-or even three-if you're as passionate about cheesy B-actor Campbell as he is about himself.
0,Mirrors reflects little beyond Splat Pack auteur Alexandre Aja's desire to push his genre into less punishing and more profitable territory.
0,A minor chiller and major downer from the talented Alexandre Aja.
0,"Alexandre Aja keeps the suspense tight for most of the movie, only to fritter it away in an overblown ending."
0,This remake of a South Korean movie ultimately provides fewer scares than the average aging baby boomer feels every time they look into a reflective surface.
0,"At nearly two hours, Mirrors is overlong for a summer horror toss-off, and the movie's three or four false endings make it seem even more of a haul."
0,Alexandre Aja's inability to delineate credible or interesting characters results in 110 wasted minutes for anyone unfortunate to wander into an auditorium where this is playing.
0,[Aja's] pedal-to-the-metal intensity only serves to heighten the film's fundamental ridiculousness.
0,How could horror be so dull?
0,Audiences won't be crazy about what they see in these Mirrors.
0,"An empty enterprise that provides a few moments of goofy fun, Mirrors reflects back nothing."
0,Mirrors is too lugubrious and misconceived to reflect the talent of those involved.
0,"The director, Alexandre Aja, knows how to reflect the fear in people's heads, but he gets too ensnared in a backstory that's just gothic business as usual."
0,"at some point Aja appears to have decided that he cannot be bothered with all this remake malarkey, and instead he just goes completely ape with his plotting...could well go on to become a cult classic."
0,Te story is efficient but strangely uninvolving and not nearly as scary as the Korean version.
1,"Some credit for this stylish screamer goes to Sutherland, forming his doughy-handsome features into an emotional punchbag. More credit goes to Nemec, sowing a harvest of dark invention in the vast spaces."
0,Kiefer Sutherland's bad days in 24 are frolics in the park next to the nonsense he endures in this scandalously poor supernatural horror.
0,"The remake retains the sensationally creepy ending and it's all reasonably done, but no real chills."
0,"There are a few effectively grisly moments, but no really new ideas."
0,This is without question the dumbest horror movie of recent years. There is simply no way to piece together its fractured shards.
0,
0,Only fitfully entertaining.
0,"Pairing cult directors with macabre omnibus material is always a tasty proposition, but the results disappoint in Trapped Ashes, a quartet of mildly sexed-up, unscary horror tales with a unifying wraparound story."
0,"With its gore-comix sensibility and self-conscious flashes of nudity, Trapped Ashes clunks along, and (to be completely petty) never really overcomes its clunky title."
0,Dennis Bartok writes this lackluster anthology of four juvenile horror stories dripping with sexual dread and goofball gore.
1,Gross-out comedy about male discomfort with female sexuality dominates this horror anthology scripted by Dennis Bartok.
0,
1,"Sparkling production design, a jubilantly retroretro score and a genuine flair for using the film and TV vocabulary of the '60s to revisit colonial arrogance put pic in the same conceptual ballpark as Austin Powers."
1,"Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath is invincibly smug, occasionally smarmy and obsessed with food. If that whets your appetite, he's your homme."
1,"Dujardin is what really makes it all work, though. He's an absolute riot, with Conneryesque looks and physicality, and the ability to segue into utter goofballery with a degree of arch-browed suaveness."
1,"Dujardin nails his character, who is deeply dense but always seems to draw the winning card, mainly through dumb luck. And Hazanavicius clearly knows the '60s-era Bond films, which are full of ripe targets that he lovingly demolishes."
0,The film is a collection of not especially funny routines - with lots of homophobic jokes thrown in - that have been done to death in previous movies of this sort.
1,A pleasant sorbet to wash away the aftertaste of the pre-summer clunkers.
0,"The hero of OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies might be described as a French equivalent of James Bond."
1,"Given that this is a French film, there's an unmistakable edge to its satirical portrayal of postwar East-West relations."
0,"Directed and co-written by Michel Hazanavicius and starring the French comedian Jean Dujardin as OSS 117, the movie is a sketch stretched to tedious feature length."
1,"The packaging is perfect, and the end results beat A View To A Kill any day."
0,"French cinema's reputation for subtlety goes up in smoke with OSS 117: Cairo Nest of Spies, a movie whose satire proves as lame as its clunky title."
1,"The French-made movie travels familiar ground, with a nod as well to Airplane!, Top Secret and that whole genre. Even compared to them, it pushes things just a little -- not too far, but toward the loony."
0,A lame comedy with a few decent laughs and several yawn-spawning set pieces that don't really go anywhere.
0,"I have never been a particular admirer of either James Bond or Austin Powers, and could hardly be expected to be overjoyed by a 'cross between them.' Hence, I was hardly surprised when I didn't crack a smile over the antics of Mr. Jean Dujardin."
1,This light-hearted pastiche is a recommended antidote to 'Quantum of Solace'.
1,"Impeccable standards, far above anything you'd expect from the parody genre."
1,"In a week of overblown, unappetising or disappointing films, this makes a refreshing change. And how interesting to be offered a French movie that doesn't come straight from the ""arthouse"" stable."
1,This French comedy fondly lampoons both the popular French spy movies adapted from Jean Bruce's novels in the 1950s and '60s and the colonialist era they were set in.

1,[An] extraordinary 74-minute tone poem.
1,"The movie, in its best moments, suggests a Haredi version of Terence Davies's 1988 masterpiece, Distant Voices, Still Lives."
1,"My Father My Lord is short, quiet, and shot in a style that favors closeness and intimacy, yet [director] Volach is able to convey in small strokes how a few rooms and buildings can become a child's whole universe."
1,"A beautifully made film, one that possesses a troubling visual sense of spiritual corruption."
0,A boy questions his father's devout life and teachings.
1,"My Father My Lord lasts just 73 minutes, and I spent the first hour or so wondering what the director-writer, David Volach, was getting at in his nearly plotless feature debut."
1,My Father My Lord has the glowing simplicity and force of a biblical parable.
1,"David Volach has created a drama that, in retrospect, feels positively biblical."
1,It's an affecting portrait of family life that gives way to a profound depiction of faith shaken to its roots.
1,"My Father My Lord is an impressive first feature that stands out for its emotional qualities, its ambition and its brevity. In this day of endless epics, this 73-minute Israeli film manages to do a lot with very little time."
1,"[Director David] Volach makes every moment count by holding tight close-ups on the faces of his extraordinarily tender, expressive cast, framing them with an elegant beauty."
1,"Volach doesn't waste a word or action in his spare, finely crafted screenplay."
1,"An impressive debut by 37-year-old Israeli writer-director David Volach, ""My Father My Lord"" squeezes more humanity into 72 minutes than most Hollywood movies can muster in two hours or more."
1,You could say this film is at once a secular fable on a religious dilemma and an almost religious parable about an all-too-human tragedy.
1,"Helped by gorgeous photography and sound design, it's a work of considerable force that bears comparison with Terence Davies's early films."
1,"Brilliantly acted, shot with rare skill and has the force of a Biblical parable without losing its essential affection towards its characters, even Abraham. Do not miss it."
1,
1,
1,An extraordinary debut.
1,"As the movie comes into focus, you feel the lives of the characters echoing backward through time."
1,Ballast is a serious achievement and a welcome sign of a newly invigorated American independent cinema.
1,
1,There's a terrific short film buried in Ballast.
1,"Ballast is truly a winter's tale, set in a bleak and rainy corner of the Mississippi Delta and recounting the story of three African Americans teetering on the edge in just about every way."
1,An impressive and courageous filmmaking debut that screams Sundance for all the right reasons.
1,"Hammer, whose blunt name belies the movie's many subtle touches, has his own distinct style. He also has an enormous trust in the audience to sort out this wounded family's miseries without the assistance of narration or even a musical score."
1,"Lance Hammer shot this debut feature in natural light, using nonprofessional actors, and with its jump cuts, music-free soundtrack, and plaintive Mississippi Delta landscapes it seems as raw as the characters' emotions."
1,"I always say I hardly ever cry at sad films, but I sometimes do, just a little, at films about good people."
1,"The movie is a beacon of independent filmmaking, not simply because Hammer opted more or less to self-distribute it, but because it's evident that we're a million miles away from Hollywood."
1,"Ballast strikes me as one of the few American pictures of 2008 to say what it wants to say, visually and narratively, about a specific situation and part of the country, in a way that transcends regional specifics."
0,"Ballast lacks ballast. Much praised by aficionados of minimalist indie cinema -- hey, who needs a plot when you've got mood? -- it's a wearying slog through anomie in a Mississippi Delta township."
1,"This austere, rigorous film has a sense of place, a feeling for reality so compelling it makes us feel like we're living it, not just watching on a screen."
1,"What this unclassifiable story may lack in decibels, it has in emotional depth."
1,Debut writer/director Lance Hammer has rendered [Ballast] with something that can only be called radiant austerity.
1,"This ostensibly simple film evokes whole lives in 96 minutes, and does so with sparse dialogue."
1,"This is a cinematic tone poem, where the dominant mood is a Faulknerian mix of sorrow and endurance..."
1,"Although the film never fulfils the promise of its elliptical, mysterious opening - the drama occasionally lacks momentum as it proceeds towards some sort of resolution - there's no denying its intelligence, compassion and assurance."
1,"A difficult, subdued film, but intelligent and with more intricacy and subtlety than at first appears."
1,"Sags in the final third, but the impeccable craftsmanship keeps matters afloat."
1,"Drugs, guns, attempted suicide. The Mississippi Delta is a watercolour landscape in duns and half-colours. Black poverty is turned over like the underside of the American dream."
1,"Quite a debut here from writer-director Lance Hammer, working on a -cule budget in the Mississippi Delta, and evoking a memorably forlorn kind of regional specificity."
1,
1,"The opening half hour is electrifying, the ending interestingly open-ended..."

0,Perhaps the film's key problem is the feeling that Klapisch lets his ambition obstruct his storytelling.
0,Not a great deal happens and there is a lot of talk.
1,"It's loose in form, but the cast lend a vigor and charm to the mood."
0,"An insane amount of dancing can't shake off the heavy feeling we've all been here before, and in the hands of more revealing guides."
0,"It is very difficult, to say the least, to believe in any of the characters."
1,Klapisch slyly uses vignettes and diversions to hide the fact that he has no perceivable endgame.
1,"Auds who like upmarket soap opera, sightseeing and Gallic films where people talk a lot about their relationships will be consistently entertained."
0,"At a 124-minute runtime, though, the writer-director has stretched a wide canvas, and only sporadically found anything worth filling it with."
0,"This could have been a true urban mosaic. Instead, we simply get a vision of Paris as the city of lite."
1,"From the catacombs to the city's heights, Paris turns an unblinking gaze on the beauty of melancholy and the daring leap toward joy."
1,Agreeable but highly forgettable.
0,Paris when it fizzles -- which is most of the time -- is a dismal series of character portraits about a cross-section of Parisians mulling turning points in their lives.
1,Mr. Klapisch's special gift is to populate his films with perfectly grounded eccentrics who use perfectly ordinary words to express poetic ideas.
1,"Although Paris makes gestures toward being a top-to-bottom examination of the city's social fabric, its perspective is solidly middle class."
0,"A pretty travelogue about mortality, Paris never quite lives up to what turns out to be a presumptuous title."
1,"Every character has life and depth. It's unusual for an episodic film to involve us so well in individual lives; as the narrative circles through their stories, we're genuinely curious about what will happen next."
1,"Writer-director Klapisch's glossy love letter to Paris, and its yearning, beautifully lighted inhabitants, may not be much, and you may not even believe in its emotional and (discreet) carnal complications moment to moment. But the cast is fabulous."
1,"Klapisch, who shoots Paris with the eye of someone rapturously in love with the town, is less interested in the reality than the romance."
0,Soggy stuff from French director Cedric Klapisch.
0,"If Paris feels like an Altman film in structure, it lacks the late filmmaker's bite, not to mention his genuine curiosity about human beings."
1,"Klapisch captures the bittersweet quality of those human contacts that seem to hold promise, but life goes by too fast for them to take root."
1,Paris keeps us involved not because of momentous plot developments but because the production incites our curiosity to see what will happen next.
1,"The French director Cdric Klapisch is a glib wizard at weaving folks together, but there are too many secondhand characters roving through Paris, his latest ensemble piece."
0,"Perhaps it's time for a moratorium on movies where the trajectories of various people intersect, often portentously, across the tableau of a big city."
1,"When it comes to being a fool for love, there are no city limits."
0,"My expectation was that the City of Lights would be displayed in an exceptional manner. Take it from me, it is not."
1,"The screenplay sometimes overdoes the winking asides, and the film doesn't so much flow as jump from one set piece to the next. But Anderson has created a world as stylized and inventive as anything he's done."
1,"The film achieves a feel that is at once coarse-grained and elegant, antiquated and the height of fashion."
1,The push and pull between the tame life and the wild one is the unifying theme. It's all very transatlantic - the setting and baddies are English; the animals are hip Americans. This is one crafty fox - in every sense.
1,"If the emotions in Mr Fox aren't as overstated or saccharine as in recent Pixar movies, it is only because Anderson has saved his greatest love for the animation process itself."
1,"Anderson's mannerisms have been irritating in the past, but pitching a film at children has restored his sweet-natured charm. This is hip - but with heart."
1,"A dazzlingly imaginative and poetically inflected comic caper that offers the tantalizing possibility that Anderson's best work, far from being a distant memory, is still to come."
1,"The director's genius for production design comes to the fore. The sets are a treasure trove of quirky details, retro-gizmos and snarky in-jokes."
1,"This is a director who knows what he wants; stop-motion offers him an effective stimulus, still allowing the creation of sweetly impractical comic characters while flourishing infinite possibilities for the manipulation of mise-en-sc챔ne."
1,"What the film lacks, for all its inventiveness, is the sense of menace and sadism that bristles through Dahl's best stories."
1,"A film full of style, where the animated creatures are dealt with in the same oblique, unexpected way that has been Anderson's trademark."
1,"The additions are okay; but it's the look that keeps you buoyed up, your eyes roaming the frames, laughing in surprise at the visual jokes and flourishes and textures. It's a dandy's movie, but that adds to the fun."
1,"For the reportedly painstaking labor it took to create, the film is a marvel to behold."
1,"It may not merit the adjective in its title, yet the animated yarn Fantastic Mr. Fox offers some of the most goofy fun you'll have at a theater this season."
1,"To Wes Anderson: More, please!"
1,"Mr. Fox doesn't just rescue Dahl's legacy on film. In a year stuffed with kid-lit movie adaptations, it's the only one to successfully reach out to children and adults."
1,An adventure in pure imagination that plays to the smart kid in all of us.
1,"A visual treasure that successfully blends deadpan quirkiness with a wry realism rarely seen in any film, let alone one for children."
1,Dahl's adult approach to children merges beautifully with the filmmaker's child's-eye view of adults.
1,"Cool, clever, crafty and delirious amounts of fun, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is full of brilliant visual invention and silly slapstick while also having hip humor and sly smarts -- it's pure movie-going joy and a rare kind of pleasure."
0,"Anderson is so afraid of mussing a hair, he keeps his stories simple and hermetically sealed off from the sloppy business of emotions."
1,"This is no more a kids' movie for kids than Where the Wild Things Are; it's a film strictly for Wes Anderson fans of all ages. By now, they should know who they are."
1,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is possibly the finest picture about family, community and poultry thievery ever made."
1,Anderson's stop-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox is both a delightful amusement and a distillation of the filmmaker's essential playfulness.
1,"Visually, its a true marvel. Perhaps best of all, it feels like something entirely new."
1,"With its clever visual jokes and sassy dialogue, Anderson's first foray into animation doesn't seem to be made entirely with children in mind. Maybe that's why it seems so perfect for them."
1,"These weirdly effective shifts in tempo, combined with an attention to detail and distinctive dialogue, make for the best moments in this offbeat adventure."
1,Life is full of surprises. The best one I've had in a good while is Fantastic Mr. Fox.
1,"It provides a pleasantly cerebral experience, exhilarating and fizzy, that goes to your head like too much Champagne."
1,"Fantastic Mr. Fox, which Mr. Anderson wrote with Noah Baumbach, and which he has been hoping to make for many years, is in some ways his most fully realized and satisfying film."
1,Fantastic Mr. Fox is a retro marvel that should delight today's audience.
1,"You don't want to watch this movie, you want to climb inside it and play."
1,Other filmmakers turn to children's stories when they have kids of their own. Anderson seems to have made this one for his inner child.
1,"It's a magical feat, one that turns puppets into personalities and an English meadow into Anderson's world."
1,"Witty and wonderful, Fantastic Mr. Fox is the perfect Thanksgiving entertainment..."
1,"While it might be a stretch to claim that Fantastic Mr. Fox is ""fantastic,"" it's easily among the year's best animated features."
0,"If only Mr. Fox were a more interesting character! Then, I think, the story's resolution would be more than merely quaint."
1,Fantastic Mr. Fox may be the perfect kids movie for grown-ups.
1,"The film's premise may be child-like, but its themes -- family, self-identity and existential angst -- are all engagingly adult."
1,"Adds yet another wry, carefully composed bibelot to the cabinet of curios that defines the Anderson oeuvre."
1,"The result is not only marvellous whimsy, but also something that advances the burgeoning retro-tech movement."
1,"Anderson injects such charm and wit, such personality and nostalgia -- evident in the old-school animation, storybook settings and pitch-perfect use of Burl Ives -- that it's easy to forgive his self-conscious touches."
1,Wes Anderson's utterly charming Fantastic Mr. Fox is that rarity: a children's movie for all.
1,"The tale may be Dahl's, but there's a whole new wag to it -- this is decidedly, weirdly and, at best, wonderfully a Wes Anderson movie."
1,"The result is a quirky film that should work for all ages, with just a hint of dark humor. In this age of high-tech animation, Wes Anderson has found himself in a low-tech wonderland."
1,"Like the rest of his movies, this one is essentially infantile -- but when you're telling the story of a ne'er-do-well fox conspiring against a trio of nasty farmers, who cares?"
1,The filmmakers hew to Dahl's intent and add fine turns of their own.
1,"The most fantastic thing about Mr. Fox is the way he shows that while our flaws can bring us down, sometimes, too, we triumph in spite of them and because of them."
1,"Children, especially, will find things they don't understand, and things that scare them. Excellent. A good story for children should suggest a hidden dimension, and that dimension of course is the lifetime still ahead of them."
1,The same eye for immaculate compositions that had seemed increasingly to hem in his human actors here serves as the basis for some of the most inventive animated set pieces this side of Nick Park.
1,"With one creative genius adapting the work of another, the result is a mesmeric, visual feast, a host of adorable eccentric characters and a truly wonderful, kid friendly, caper."
1,A boisterous and magnificent treat.
1,"Visually, the movie is a wonder, with its profusion of detail and exquisitely focussed ""performances"" by the figurines, whom Anderson frames in images as precisely composed as those in his live-action work."
1,"Sometimes too clever by half, the film, replete with in-jokes, may in some ways work better for adults. Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, and Jason Schwarztman also provide adept voice work."
0,"Overacted and overblown, pic will underwhelm commercially, with theatrical perhaps limited to friends and family."
1,[A] pleasant if uninspired adaptation of Noel Streatfeild's children's classic.
0,"The odd engaging moment is always followed by a cloying eye-roller, such as when a nearly-new ball appears on their dusty Monterey sandlot. ""Father, what does it mean?"" ""It means God wants us to play baseball!"""
0,"Although based on the real-life tale of nine underage underdogs from Monterrey, Mexico who swept the 1957 Little League World Series, this Cinderella sports story rings false from first pitch to last."
1,"A very sweet, very slight family movie that scores smiles and tears of joy."
1,"The heart of both the story and its telling do help in smoothing over other deficiencies, sweet and disarming in its belief that something like a baseball game can make a bigger difference."
1,"The climactic drama of the championship game owes largely to the fact that, despite their unprecedented success as a foreign team in the tournament, young Angel Macias and his teammates somehow didn't go down in history, at least not stateside."
0,"A paper-thin telling of a genuinely remarkable story that lifts the bullet points of a Mexican team's unprecedented run through the Little League World Series, and fills out the rest with stereotypes and rank sentimentality."
0,Well-meaning but thick with cliches.
0,"The film is perfectly mediocre, which is heartbreaking, not heartwarming."
1,"You sort of know how these underdog sports movies turn out. Doesn't matter. The Perfect Game so expertly uses the charisma and personalities of the actors, especially the young ones, that it's thrilling anyway."
1,It's an unabashedly corny but occasionally stirring dramedy based on the true-life story of scrappy young baseball players from Mexico.
0,So overwhelmed by its own based-on-actual-events tale that it can't find the tone to tell it effectively.
0,"Anyone much older than, say, 10, will likely find the underdog saga sappy and manipulative, not to mention filled with sports movie cliches, including the following statement: ""It will take a miracle to make them into a real team."""
1,"This inspirational film, written by first-timer (and producer) W. William Winokur, is not for cynics or those resistant to cute kids (and child actors sometimes given to mugging)."
0,"A big, bland serving of corn that wouldn't have been out of place on The Wonderful World of Disney 50 years ago."
0,[From] the second minute of the movie I knew every single thing that was going to happen and there was not a single surprise.
0,Director William Dear is not one to miss a sentimental beat.
0,Notable only for being a catalog of just about every kid-pic cliche' ever committed to film.
0,Shutter Island is a long slog. The sad thing is that Scorsese could have connected emotionally with Lehane's narrative.
1,"Since more attention has gone into filigreeing details into each scene than worrying about the way they'll fit together, the rattletrap engages you moment-to-moment, even as the overall pacing stops and lurches alarmingly."
1,"Martin Scorsese makes movies as if his life depends on it, never skimping on ferocity and feeling."
1,"The spirit of Alfred Hitchcock is clearly alive and well, and is currently residing in Martin Scorsese's latest film, Shutter Island."
1,"A remarkable high-wire act, performed without a net and exploiting all the accumulated skills of a consummate artist. It dazzles and provokes. But since when did Scorsese become a circus performer?"
1,"Expert, screw-turning narrative filmmaking put at the service of old-dark-madhouse claptrap."
1,"A gripping, suspenseful mystery whose plot doesn't so much twist, as writhe as the viewer attempts to grasp it... compelling and captivating, a revitalised gothic mystery that is both terrific and thrilling to the last."
0,"It's not bad, but as Scorsese, America's greatest living filmmaker and film history buff should know, even Hitchcock came up short on occasion."
0,"If a film is going to pile on the doom and foreboding this thickly, the payoff better be worth the hard road viewers have to slog."
1,"It may not have any of the technological bells and whistles of the latest 3-D offerings, but no movie in recent memory immerses the audience so deeply in its look and feel as the old-fashioned, two-dimensional Shutter Island."
0,"How could this many talented people get so utterly, confoundingly messed up? How could a director considered such an icon make so much money and demonstrate so little control?"
0,"Scorsese is pushing, I guess, for something that combines a '40s horror-thriller with a contemporary psychological tragedy. What he ends up with is more like a Hardy Boys mystery directed by David Lynch."
1,"The strength of the film, like the book, is that it never allows the viewer to feel comfortable with what he is watching."
0,"If Martin Scorsese weren't aware of himself as a great filmmaker, he could never have made a movie as bad as Shutter Island."
1,"Despite its flaws, Shutter Island is worth seeing for the palpably nightmarish and gothic world conceived by Scorsese."
1,"In Shutter Island, director Martin Scorsese has created a divinely dark and devious brain tease of a movie in the best noir tradition."
1,"A luridly effective thrill ride of a movie that leaves no old-dark-house stone unturned, including a host of rats, a series of flashbacks involving doomed children, and water, water everywhere."
1,"""Shutter Island"" is not from the Scorsese who stands astride film like a colossus; instead, it's a giddy, gory gift from the Scorsese who sits beside us in the theater, elbowing us at the good bits and taking in the sinister spectacle up on screen."
0,"The movie is inert, despite the fact that it bombards us with lurid imagery and high-intensity stimuli: frozen Dachau victims, dying Nazis, beautiful child murderesses, abandoned graveyards besieged by hurricanes."
0,"Martin Scorsese's latest is a puff of smoke, the type of classic Hollywood mystery hailed as art when done by auteurs and dismissed as ham when done by anyone less esteemed."
1,"It's as startling a change of pace for this director as The Shining was for Stanley Kubrick, and often just as unnerving."
0,"This is a long, heavy film, in which Scorsese's aerobic moviemaking turns mannered and uncharacteristically passive."
1,An unapologetically derivative film full of visual nods that appeal mostly to movie geeks.
1,"Using every tool at his disposal, Scorsese honors Lehane's pulp intensity by amplifying the story to the fevered Grand Guignol of a Park Chan-wook movie, or Sam Fuller's asylum classic Shock Corridor."
0,"Mr. Scorsese's camera sense effectively fills every scene with creepiness, but sustained, gripping suspense seems beyond his grasp."
1,"What Scorsese brings to the table, having created more than his share of rascally villains, is a renewed sense of horror and despair at the power of evil."
0,The plot doesn't so much thicken as curdle with every heebie-jeebie encounter -- we've taken a U-turn at the terrific Cape Fear and wound up at Cape Folly.
0,"I'm of the opinion that DiCaprio is still far too lightweight a performer to carry the grizzled, haunted character that Scorsese is asking him to portray here."
1,"The movie does have a payoff, though. And it works, shiveringly well."
0,"For all the trickiness and bluster, Shutter Island is dead inside."
0,"This quasi-horror film has the great director's usual craftsmanship and a stellar cast, but ultimately it's an infuriating trick that makes its most provocative ideas disappear."
1,One of DiCaprio's best performances in an unforgettable psychological jigsaw puzzle.
0,"Shutter Island is hysterical, in the clinical and cinematic senses, followed by plodding, just when a potboiling contraption cannot afford to be."
1,"Shutter Island is popcorn entertainment polished to an unusually high sheen. Yes, you could argue the movie is simply a mood piece. But what a mood."
1,The film's primary effect is on the senses. Everything is brought together into a disturbing foreshadow of dreadful secrets.
0,"Sorry, but the late reward hardly justifies all that punishment."
1,A movie that keeps you guessing to the end and then -- miraculously -- makes the guessing pay off.
1,What is real? What is delusion? What is montrous? What is decent? Shutter Island may not shatter the heart but these are gnawing achievements for a movie about madness and paranoia.
1,"This is among Scorsese's many gifts: Even when he's not crafting a masterpiece, he reminds you that the movies possess visceral and uncanny powers."
1,Not since Raging Bull has Mr. Scorsese so brazenly married brutality to beauty. Not since Kundun has one of his films felt so aspirational.
0,Martin Scorsese's elephantine exercise in B-movie badness.
1,"Showing an explosive temper and a wounded psyche, DiCaprio eerily channels the great Richard Widmark, a film noir giant, as Teddy, a shaky World War II veteran still at war with his memories."
1,"An exquisitely crafted potboiler offering up two and a quarter hours of thrills, chills and Leonardo DiCaprio freaking out in a nuthouse during a hurricane."
0,As Shutter Island proceeds -- mostly as a series of speeches and set pieces -- what is meant to be mysterious and unsettling becomes just plain incomprehensible.
1,"Umberto Eco wrote, ""Two clich챕s make us laugh but a hundred clich챕s move us, because we sense dimly that the clich챕s are talking among themselves, celebrating a reunion."" Shutter Island is that reunion, and that shrine."
0,"It comes on strong, but in its bloody heart of hearts it's no more resonant than one of those old Vincent Price-Edgar Allan Poe contraptions - and less entertaining, too."
0,"At the end of it, I got a whiff of shaggy dog."
0,"Scorsese is capable of making a fascinating psychological thriller, but this effort is sub-Tarantino, without the irony."
0,"Unsuccessful but fascinating and often entertaining attempt from Martin Scorsese to wrangle with baroque pulp fiction - by turns compelling, hysterical and silly."
1,"As senseless, perverse and unwieldy as it undoubtedly is, Shutter Island might be Scorsese's most enjoyable film in a decade."
1,"Shutter Island is too long and its increasingly surreal tone provides an ending that's a bit of a cheat. But, since it is a Scorsese picture, there's a lot to intrigue on the way."
0,It's just not exciting.
0,"Since Scorsese is a stylist, the film is enjoyable. It would be more so if you could take out your brain and experience it only with eyes and ears."
0,"Shutter Island could have been an entertainingly hysterical trainwreck, but the train doesn't even leave the station."
0,"The problem, then, arrives in the film's hurried final act, where a hitherto steady narrative gives way to an engorged twist that, whilst believable, insults the audience's comprehension of everything that has come before."
1,A brilliantly constructed mystery.
1,
1,"A struggling anorexic and her physical opposite form an unlikely friendship in disFIGURED, a funny, awkward and often uncomfortable drama."
1,"With verve, style and a fine sense of the human side of surf culture, Jeremy Gosch makes a terrific splash with his debut doc."
0,"While it's pleasurable to watch surf legends wax nostalgic about fissures in the precorporate surf lifestyle, Bustin' would be better served by delving a bit deeper into the erosion of a native culture."
0,"Some of the talk gets a little bombastic, but it's hard to deny the thrill involved."
1,Bustin' Down the Door entertainingly captures surfing's last great hoorah of no-holds-barred radicalism.
1,"Happily, the filmmaker, Jeremy Gosch, puts his wide-eyed narrative together with an easy touch. With its amazing wall-to-wall footage of oceanic derring-do Bustin' Down the Door plays like visual air-conditioning."
1,
1,"[An] insightful account of the rise of a, pardon the pun, new wave of surfers that transformed the sport in the mid-1970s."
0,"The film tries to tell us that money hasn't spoiled the fun, but I was much more curious about the black shorts than the Quicksilver brand board shorts."
1,"This impressive sports doc finds enough drama in the situation to involve a wider audience, since the archive footage of these chaps gliding through waves the size of a house is quite something."
1,"The characters aren't quite as charismatic as the Z-Boys and the editing isn't as abrasively cool, but it does give a glimpse of how an outsider lifestyle evolved into a multibillion-dollar business."
1,The documentary celebrates the athleticism and creativity of the sport's unsung Nureyevs and Nijinskys.
1,"Despite the group's many successes, self-pitying tears are rarely far from their eyes. It's fascinating stuff and unfathomably bleak."
1,"Although you'd expect moist eyes from bitter, fading stars desperately trying to scrawl their names in the history books, the film avoids this indignity with engaging characters, an informative narrative and tons of awe-inspiring archive footage."
1,"Once or twice - making it all worthwhile - an interviewee touchingly chokes up at his own memories, and brims with sudden tears."
0,At times it's quite moving - Wayne Bartholomew breaks down on camera as he recalls his hardscrabble childhood - though Edward Norton's narration has all the nuance of an I-Speak-Your-Weight machine.
1,"Watching top surfers in action is never a chore, but the film's archive footage would have been even more enjoyable to lay viewers if the commentary had better explained why the men's innovations were so daring and controversial."
0,"Seemingly made to capitalize on a dubious CG innovation -- namely, the slicing of bodies in half by whizzing five-pointed stars -- Ninja Assassin has little else to recommend it, not even laughs."
0,"There's more to making sword-and-splatter work than just shiny blades and blood. It's got to have an edge, and the one on Ninja Assassin is dull as a butter knife."
1,It is indeed filled with lots of ninjas who are constantly at each other's throats with all manner of sharp implements.
1,"Ninja Assassin lives in the moment, a visceral gouge of a picture, and sections of it move so fast -- and are so intriguingly, dimly lit -- that you have to use your imagination a bit to discern what's happening."
0,"Heads may roll, torsos get severed and geysers of blood spurt, but no amount of CGI'd gore can save 'Assassin' from being dramatically lame, visually impaired and kinetically flat-footed."
0,The credits for Ninja Assassin list two screenwriters and one director. But it's fair to say the movie has come straight out of a box.
0,"If Ninja Assassin boasted sexual content equivalent to its level of violence, it would be rated NC-17 and repulse even the most dedicated perverts"
0,"This amateurish action flick is so lacking in personality or punch, it ought to be titled ""V for Video Store Discount Bin."""
1,"Let's be honest, killing is this film's business... and business is good."
0,"McTeigue can barely shoot straight, and the editing is so hack-y, you have to take the stunts and fight choreography on faith."
0,"This movie may be filled with razor-sharp shuriken and katanas, but as far as the filmmaking goes, it's a blunt instrument."
0,This shockingly disjointed and relentlessly dull picture can't even deliver the martial-arts kick its title so plainly promises.
0,"Since the ninjas only come out when it's dark, most of the movie's fight scenes are low on both visibility and excitement."
0,"This saga, set in Berlin, is more committed to its bloodletting than to any of its characters."
0,A movie that provides plenty of jolts but precious little pleasure.
1,This movie knows exactly what it is: Gonzo silliness about bodies turned into human salsa.
0,"Shouldn't throwing stars be silent? If they're gonna sound like gunshots, why not just use guns?"
0,"It's a gorefest, a borefest and a snorefest."
0,"Thanks to the movie's dire script, flat performances and excessively slick, tricked-out fight scenes, it gets increasingly hard to care about anything that goes on here, even when it happens to be visible without the use of night-vision goggles."
0,"This one is simply a diverting, uncommonly violent action flick. No need for an extended critical postmortem. Except to say the Wachowski brothers' trademark seems to have turned into a designer brand dedicated to producing inexpensive knockoffs."
1,"Rain is a very talented slaughterer. He could kill you with a pair of tweezers, a hair dryer, two bananas, whatever. Be glad he's a good ninja."
0,"When a movie's first scene shows one thug getting the top of his head sliced off and another being chopped diagonally in half, you know you're not in for much of a dramatic crescendo."
1,"What's a recovering ninja assassin to do? Why, paint the screen bright red, of course. Splatter it on. We're talking streaks and rivers of blood -- bloody swords, bloody clothes and, my personal favorite, bloody stumps."
0,"The problem is that the fight sequences -- the only reason anyone sees a movie like this in the first place -- are muddy, chaotic and boring. Even diehard fans of this genre would be well advised to skip this one."
0,Perhaps such phenomenal slaughter is best left to the imagination.
0,A garish and poorly filmed chop-socky frolic that makes about as much sense as an Escher painting viewed through Vaseline-smudged Ray-Bans.
0,Ninja Assassin is final proof that the once innovative Wachowski Brothers have indeed lost their creative mojo.
0,The fight scenes are uninspired and I suspect post-pubescent audiences will be very bored.
1,"The fight scenes are mostly great. And Rain, so dashing in Speed Racer, is something to behold. His precisely rippled and defined body is awe-inspiring."
0,"It truly wouldn't take much - a minor re-edit, a few arch looks to camera, a wiseacre sidekick named 'Shortballs' - to inch this utterly mystifying throwback into spoof territory."
0,"When the slicing and dicing and blood-spurting become as unstoppably frenzied as they do in the course of Ninja Assassin, one's instinct is less to take fright than take 40 winks and hope to wake up when it's all over."
0,The first time we see heads roll it's entertaining. The second time it's boring. The eighth time...
0,
1,"Recount, an efficient and relentless enactment of the strategists on both sides of the Florida controversy, shows an accident that was waiting to happen."
0,"The movie doesn't embrace its potential for farce, for suspense, or for outrage. Ultimately, the filmmakers could have punched a little harder."
0,"A splendid cast mostly just sits around watching the bad news on television, dutiful to the letter of Danny Strong's conscientious script yet insufficiently roused to righteous spirit even as, before their eyes, our republic gets banana'd."
1,An astute and deliciously engrossing film.
1,Butterfly ballots and hanging chads become the stuff of great political intrigue.
1,"An electrifying slapstick tragedy about a mad moment in American politics, a moment that must never happen again but easily could."
1,"Smart, star-studded and anchored by another fine-tuned performance from Kevin Spacey."
1,It's impossible to overstate the excellent casting here.
1,"In the end, spin wins out over substance, just as it does in every modern American fairy tale."
0,"It grovels for the approval of political junkies while flaunting the shallowest interest in politics, and everything flows from there in the most silly fashion."
1,I think it's one of the best movies of the year.
1,It's so suspenseful that it's easy to forget that you already know how it ends.
0,"Even when the complicated political and legal machinations are handled gracefully, Recount doesn't have time to give these people depth or render their unique situations with sufficient shadings of complexity."
1,The tension that swirled around thousands of disputed Florida ballots after the November 2000 election was almost Shakespearean... Recount effectively dramatizes that struggle.
0,The movie possesses an underlying smugness that seems to say that all would be well in the world today if only Al Gore had eked out a win that fateful November and December - a conclusion that is impossible to reach.
1,"If you have the slightest interest in politics and movie treatments thereof, I recommend it."
1,"What's in it for viewers just looking for a good time? Since this is only a movie, with imagined dialogue and Hollywood stars, it must pass the entertainment test. Mostly, it does."
1,It's a gorgeous bit of political theater.
1,Recount is nonetheless accomplished and useful in piecing together a sequence of events that seemed confusing and chaotic from the outside. The effect is like watching a freeway pile-up in slow motion.
1,"The cable channel has taken a difficult, divisive topic and turned it into a clear, fast-moving thriller with comical overtones."
1,"Given its timeliness, ""Recount"" is a painful sort of fun, and likely a great argument starter."
0,This nightmare scenario is to high-school valedictorians what this wreck of a movie is to comedy screenwriters.
0,"Every time the story shows some glimmer of originality, it immediately retreats back to formula."
0,"[A] joyless, offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce."
0,"Wants to emulate a John Hughes film, in much the same way that a crack whore wearing a dime-store tiara wants to emulate Queen Elizabeth."
0,"The characters lack charm and dimension, falling into stereotypical molds. Joyless scenarios bounce between scenes of driving around town and predictable party mayhem."
0,"Panettiere, I'm sad to report, is a dud as the title character, a supposed wild thang who never rises above the level of runty, obnoxious mall chick, down to the roll-on tan."
0,"I Love You, Beth Cooper provides so few laughs I nearly wandered out of the theater midway to go look for some somewhere."
1,"The story is timeless; this could have taken place when [screenwriter] Doyle graduated in '76 -- or any year, really, since the effects of high school linger throughout adult life and nerds are forever."
0,"If watching this makes you long to be young again, you probably grew up in an Algerian prison."
0,"I Love You, Beth Cooper tries to exploit and explode broad stereotypes, but it never transcends the labels it applies."
0,"A miscast and misjudged graduation-night comedy, Cooper occasionally -- only occasionally -- wanders into 'harmless.'"
0,"The writer of I Love You, Beth Cooper says the story is based on a dream. I believe him. This is one of the very few movies where I wanted the hero to wake up and discover it was only a dream."
0,"Suffering through I Love You, Beth Cooper is like being locked in detention with five idiots misquoting The Breakfast Club."
1,"The script by Larry Doyle, based on his novel, has some smart flashes, and a few of the young performers resemble real people and not the usual prefab teen idols."
0,"This unfunny, unoriginal, charmless teen comedy is so stunningly awful from start to finish, it's amazing to think its director has made a single film before, much less a dozen."
0,"A flat, tired rehash of teen movie story tropes, the film attempts to have it both ways by winkingly acknowledging its secondhand origins."
0,"As pleasurable as revisiting the glossy, witty, misadventure-filled realm Hughes created for his adolescent characters is, you've also been here before. Often."
0,One high school graduation party that you won't want to attend.
0,[Columbus'] new film feels curiously outdated.
1,Makes for a lively and refreshing glimpse into how the other half lives.
0,A sweet effort that touches all the bases that have been touched so many times before.
0,"Like the high school's bison mascot, this romp is lean on fresh laughs."
0,"With roles that seem tailor-made for Michael Cera and Jonah Hill, this nerd wish-fulfillment comedy reminded me of Superbad, though a more accurate title might be Sub-Bad."
0,"The charmlessness of its central characters -- Rust's charisma-challenged Denis, Panettiere's Barbie-hard and vacuous Beth -- makes this putative farce all the more difficult to endure."
0,"The filmmakers lacked the courage and conviction to tell an honest, character-based story and resorted to something that has been massaged into a more comfortable, easily consumable cinematic morsel."
0,"Aiming for the heartfelt hilarity of Superbad, I Love You, Beth Cooper is just super bad."
0,"I Love You, Beth Cooper moves along, taking two steps backward into crassness for every clever or just plain sweet moment it offers."
0,Beth Cooper isn't a terrible addition to the teen coming-of-age party movie catalog. It just feels dated.
0,"Adapted by Larry Doyle from his 2007 novel, I Love You, Beth Cooper peaks early -- like, during the first three minutes -- and rapidly goes downhill from there."
0,"With its painfully awkward shifts between pat sentimentality, hackneyed teen-movie tropes and parent-baiting raunchiness, there's little to love about I Love You, Beth Cooper."
0,A disappointingly flabby teen flick that reaches for (and spectacularly fails to grasp) both the effective sincerity of a John Hughes film and the irresistible humor of Superbad.
0,"If fun is what you're looking for, you might want to avoid I Love You, Beth Cooper, a drab and incoherent teen comedy."
0,"The mood doesn't build on itself, the emotional moments barely register and you start to hope the sun will rise soon."
0,The story quickly -- and I mean quickly -- devolves into an unimaginative high school retread.
0,This is dreadful. This is a pathetic excuse for a movie.
1,The real problem is that it doesn't have any heart. This is by-the-numbers film-making in which even those moments when the characters step off the merry-go-round to catch their breath feel manufactured.
0,"There's the potential for 'Superbad'-style comedy when Denis and his pal go on the run with Beth and friends, but the pace is slow and lines fall flat thanks to long pauses and hammy delivery."
0,"The pace is oddly sluggish, the flashbacks are awkward, and most of the risque lines die a death, but there are two reasons to stay with it - Rust himself as the super-dweeb hero and Jack T Carpenter as his movie-quoting best friend."
0,This is pretty average stuff.
0,This adaptation of Larry Doyle's bestseller is too soul-starved and lethally bland to warm the cockles.
0,"If as much care were taken with script as with visuals, pic would have more impact."
0,One and one (and one and one and one and one) never quite add up to two.
0,"If only ""11-11-11"" had arrived a little closer to Thanksgiving - the turkey connection would have been entirely appropriate."
0,"If the ineffectiveness knob goes up to ten, this film manages to turn it up to you-know-what."
1,Every situation is presented with maximum lucidity and almost complete inscrutability.
0,"An extravagantly pointless exercise in protracting the buildup to some meaningless carnage, garnished with metaphysical pretension so cutesy and vague that it feels actively insulting."
1,Skolimowski ties these characters' stories so close together that you're never really sure who they are. And that's OK.
1,"""11 Minutes"" finds veteran Polish writer-director Jerzy Skolimowski in a decidedly experimental mood."
1,"Skolimowski's technique is impressive: the overlapping narratives are expertly handled, and the points of intersection can be dazzling."
1,"11th Hour presents the viewer with reams of depressing data, loads of hand-wringing about the woeful state of humanity and, finally, some altogether fascinating ideas about how to go about solving the climate crisis."
1,"The 11th Hour, directed and written by Leila Conners Petersen and Nadia Conners, mixes in enough hard science to make the Deepak Chopra New Age flummery less easy to snicker at."
0,A cautionary eco-doc so earnest and moth-eaten it should properly be seen on filmstrip during fourth-period social studies.
1,"Alternately impassioned, despairing, edifying, and hectoring about all the ways humans are screwing up the earth in a death rattle of hubris."
1,"It is unabashedly a documentary of talking heads, but it works."
1,"If you still need an argument about global warming, the documentary -- makes a good one."
1,"A haunting, elegiac history of how human beings have brought the planet to the edge of a precipice, and call upon an impressive array of thinkers to discuss how, and whether, we can avoid the abyss that waits below."
0,Unusually undisguised leftism. The scare montages are--I'm not making this up--very similar to one shown in last year's remake of The Omen.
0,"The 11th Hour is slick and passionate, but neither persuasive nor helpful; it's a headache of a film directed like an Errol Morris project, but with half the substance. It's clearly preaching to the choir, but even they may find it off-key."
1,"An unnerving, surprisingly affecting documentary about our environmental calamity [that] is such essential viewing."
1,"If you get through the first hour without slitting your throat, the cautiously optimistic last third offers some intriguing options."
1,A sobering look at the astounding changes in our planet over the last generation -- and the bleak future that awaits us if we don't get our act together.
1,The picture almost beats its theme to death -- the first hour is enough -- but the imaginative designers dreaming up a cleaner future end this Cassandra cry on an upbeat note.
0,"If it gets people thinking about which light bulbs they buy and their current gas mileage and such, then it's good to have it in the world. It is, however, a panicky blur as documentaries go."
1,"The shadowy photography of the interviewees lends an ominous tone to nearly every scene, but what they're saying is often pragmatic and helpful."
1,An Inconvenient Truth was short on how to make life better. It rushed through a list of 'what to do next' offerings in the film's last few minutes. Here is where The 11th Hour shines.
0,"Consistent with the film's occasionally hippy-dippy tone, DiCaprio speaks about human beings engaging in a willed 'evolution in consciousness,' which sounds a little too desperate to be comforting."
1,"If Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth was a warning, The 11th Hour is the red alert."
0,The film lacks both the personality and central figure (as well as the all-important sense of humor) that made last year's similar An Inconvenient Truth so watchable.
1,It benefits the most by providing good advice and an abundance of well-considered ideas from forward thinkers of all stripes and persuasions who refuse to give up hope.
1,"The filmmakers take pains not to foster fatalistic gloom, concentrating on some of the progressive solutions still available to us."
0,"This movie, for all its noble intentions, is a bore. Rent An Inconvenient Truth instead. Even if you've already seen it."
1,"The movie says we have to get back to the garden before complacency and ignorance hasten our demise. This is a hard argument to make without sounding kooky, but the documentary is too dire to turn dippy, cheesy, or sentimental."
0,It's like sitting through a college lecture and knowing with gripping dread that you're going to be quizzed on all of this afterward.
0,"No matter what time it is in the grand, cosmic scheme of things, The 11th Hour arrives about a day late and an eco-dollar short of An Inconvenient Truth"
0,"For all its scare tactics, The 11th Hour simply isn't that compelling, and we're talking about the end of the world here."
0,The movie needed to reflect its own lesson: Less would have been more.
1,"It's not a movie with a lot of answers, but The 11th Hour does push the debate further down the road."
0,
1,"A heavy dose of hysteria along with copious scientific data means that, even at 90 minutes, it can feel unwieldy and quite overwhelming. Still, if you're able to handle the pace, it is in the end, a positive eye-opener."

1,The pic showcases an excellent performance by a chubbed-out Matt Damon as a Midwestern executive who's so smart he's dumb.
0,"A comedy about corporate fraud, malfeasance and a mental disorder that never quite succeeds as a comedy."
1,"The Informant! is a return to form for Soderbergh, who couldn't seem to put anything resembling an emotional charge into his recent films...This time, Soderbergh is in full control, and his star is on fire."
0,The Informant! does raise a fascinating question: How can humans so compartmentalize their psyches? But Whitacre has no stature -- he's just a nut.
0,"The filmmakers have painted a 1990s story with a 1970s palette, and the tone clashes with the setting, like plaid on paisley."
1,"The Informant! says that people who do good or ill have complex motives for their actions, and that not everyone is knowable, instantly or ever."
1,[Damon] -- who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor -- is in nimble control as he reveals his character's deep crazies.
0,"If only The Informant! was as giddy as its exclamation-point title, as jaunty as its corporate Muzak soundtrack -- or even as funny as its TV commercials."
1,"The Informant! is a hoot, an ever-escalating tale of corporate crime, greed and out-and-out craziness."
0,"The Informant! is one of [Soderbergh's] ugliest works, photographed on the RED digital camera system in such a way that depth of field is meaninglessly flattened into backlit brown mush."
0,"While this film fits squarely into Soderbergh's recurrent goal of ignoring audience interest when possible, that's the only area in which it can be considered a success."
0,"Despite an appealing central performance from Matt Damon, disguised in a mustache and complicated swoop of hair, The Informant! feels like a jumble of ideas rather than a concerted whole."
1,"Soderbergh takes a deadly serious news story and amplifies and colors it to the point of outrageousness. The results aren't always consistent, but they are undeniably compelling."
0,"The Informant! is too clever by half -- and yet, at the same time, not quite as smart as it thinks."
1,A whimsical and light-hearted spin on a serious story of corporate whistleblowing.
1,"As Soderbergh lovingly peels away veil after veil of deception, the film develops into an unexpected human comedy. Not that any of the characters are laughing."
0,"Soderbergh, despite three lighthearted Ocean's films, is not a natural comedic director."
1,The Informant! has two aces going for it: Soderbergh's poking at the mazelike holes in American business and Damon's whirling dervish performance.
1,Few directors other than Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can make films with the same geek joy -- the same love of cinematic history -- as Steven Soderbergh.
1,"A bait-and-switch film that promises caper comedy with silly hair and dated-fashion costumes, and ends up with something that's much weirder -- a marshmallow-light corporate satire."
1,"[Damon] occupies his equivocating antihero utterly, capturing the Walter Mittyish self-delusion, the desperate desire to please, and the bottomless conviction that, whatever his transgressions, he's still one of the good guys."
1,"It suggests that in a world gone mad, even the good guys can be a little cracked, and that, in an age of self-indulgence, it might be hard for a whistleblower to heed his own alarms."
1,The exclamation point in the title is your first clue that Steven Soderbergh's intentions here are more than a little askew.
1,"Damon's voice and demeanor are just right, and the actor-who really is an actor, a good one-works out Whitacre's particularities like a character man stepping up to a leading role, rather than a movie star, slumming."
1,"While the details are fresh, the story arc follows a standard pattern, a cautionary tale of spiraling bad-faith decisions. But Soderbergh and Burns compensate by playing the story for wry laughs and adding an almost distracting variety of texture."
1,"...a strange, strong, tragically funny comedy about all the lies we tell ourselves and others to make it through the wicked world and the working week."
1,"A smart, cynical movie about how we buy now -- oops, I mean, how we live now."
1,Closer to a Coen Brothers farce than A Civil Action or North Country.
1,"The Informant! is more amusing than laugh-out-loud hilarious, but is never boring."
1,"Shooting fast and digital in just 30 days, Soderbergh invests the film with the breathless pace of a thriller and the gravity befitting a nation's soul sickness. Damon makes Whitacre recognizably human."
1,"I enjoyed it, in a momentary-diversion sort of way, without really being sure it was worth doing."
1,"In adapting reporter Kurt Eichenwald's non-fiction account of Mark E. Whitacre, the corporate corn husker turned federal snitch, Soderbergh has given this incredible story exactly the amount of insanity it deserves."
0,"Mr. Damon plays it admirably straight, for the most part, thereby serving as a counterweight to the clamorous self-delight that surrounds him. Unfortunately, that's not enough to save the production..."
1,"Soderbergh is a good listener, too, always alert to the myriad ways his characters reveal, conceal and finally betray themselves in thought, word and deed."
0,Mark's collection of bizarre behaviors doesn't add up to a character.
1,"Soderbergh has transformed this into a treatise on the incompetence of everyone involved: the informant, the corporation upon which he informs, the lawyers, and the FBI. Strangely enough, it's completely believable."
1,"I liked the movie quite a bit, but by the end I felt as if I were at a live TV show with a blinking sign ordering me to LAUGH."
0,"It'd be a tragedy if it weren't so richly absurd, but it would also make for better comedy if the joke weren't on us. The Informant! laughs so long and hard that it forgets to check whether we're laughing along."
1,"Damon is an agile comic performer, and Soderbergh knows how to serve him up without losing sight of the ultimate seriousness behind it all."
1,"It may come across like a self-satisfied madcap bauble, but that titular exclamation mark is the key that unlocks the myriad subtextual delights of Soderbergh's timely latest."
1,"Director Stephen Soderbergh and its star Matt Damon have crafted a skittish caper movie, a pyrotechnical display of colourful lies that unravel to a giddy retro score."
0,"Soderbergh has commissioned a relentlessly jazzy, wacky musical score from Hollywood veteran Marvin Hamlisch just so that we realise it's all supposed to be funny."
0,"The Informant! is far from negligible, but it's undoubtedly second-tier Soderbergh."
1,"It's easy to forget that Damon is a talented character actor. The Informant! might be too feather-light to bring him the plaudits he deserves, but it's to his credit that this is one of the most enjoyable films in months."
1,Damon makes his character ridiculous in a very convincing way while never for a moment overplaying.
0,"Scott Z Burns's script hinges entirely on incidents that take place off-screen. The film will only work if audiences fail to notice this. But they won't, so it won't."
0,"The problem with The Informant!, aside from that overcoaxing exclamation mark, is that it's not especially funny."
1,"You never know where you stand with Steven Soderbergh, but you cannot accuse him of resting on his laurels -- or making the same film twice."
1,"In the end, it seems as though it's better to aim for searing moments and whiff on greatness than to shoot for the middle and hit it."
1,"Although not a blockbuster, The Informant is an interesting, diverting film."
1,"This remake of the 1987 dystopian classic has a better cast, more meticulous script and, naturally, flashier effects, but it lacks the original's wit and subversive slipperiness."
1,"It's a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era's darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul."
1,"There are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about remakes of action classics, but director Jose Padilha's 21st-century take on Paul Verhoeven's exhilarating, satirical 1987 RoboCop is solid and thoughtful, with a few genuinely inventive moments."
0,"A dumbed-down shoot-em-up frontloaded with elaborate but perfunctory new ""satirical"" material in which the movie loses interest with breathtaking speed."
0,Leadenly manufactured - or perhaps from binned leftovers of the alloy used for biomechanical policemen - RoboCop is the remake no one needed.
0,"The film is not only unchallenging, it seems actively scared of challenging us. You emerge feeling pacified and only semi-entertained."
0,Destined for the reboot scrapheap.
1,"Junking Verhoeven's sledgehammer satire in favour of real-world politics and 12A thrills, this is a slicker, shinier, admittedly inferior affair - but it's by no means a write-off."
0,"Though this Robo reboot resonates to some degree with its depiction of military drone strikes, the film sidesteps deeper questions about the intersection of technology, law enforcement and politics."
1,"Every generation, apparently, gets the ""RoboCop"" it deserves, or perhaps desires."
0,"The revamped RoboCop has a lot in common with the Ford Edsel, history's most notorious automotive misfire."
1,"It's unfortunate, then, that this RoboCop reboot shrugs off the pointed satire too soon, devolving into just another big action vehicle - even if it's a well-made, entertaining one at times."
1,"RoboCop is no canned remake of the 1987 action film. It's a reimagining that responds to everything that has changed in American life over the past 27 years, addressing new threats and exploiting new anxieties."
0,"The film doesn't embarrass itself or dishonor its predecessor, which is something."
1,"The new RoboCop has just about no interest in being the old RoboCop, and for that we can be thankful."
1,"There are plenty of high-tech gunbattles in this ""Robo,"" which make it a real pulse-pounder. But it's the intelligence behind the gunplay that makes it distinctive."
1,This is a superhero film for grown-ups that reflects a moment when drone usage is hotly debated and it's no longer ridiculous to contemplate a man who might have several metal limbs.
0,"RoboCop avoids being a bad remake by giving the original wide berth, but all we're left with this time around is a cop who becomes a robot without being particularly interesting in either incarnation."
1,"Like RoboCop himself, it doesn't seem quite as truly, organically alive as it once did. But it sure looks sleek, and moves pretty fast. And if you don't think too much, it almost feels like the real thing."
0,"A kinder, gentler RoboCop. What scares us in 2014 isn't that we could someday make a robot Murphy. It's that we probably already can."
0,"It's all rather surprisingly well acted (Kinnaman and Oldman are better than they even need to be), but ""RoboCop"" is missing a crucial ingredient: fun."
0,"The re-imagined crime, action, sci-fi thriller isn't going for the biting satire of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original, or its extreme violence. The sci-fi side hasn't evolved much. And the thrill? Well, most of the thrill is gone."
1,"At least offers something resembling ideas of morality and mortality in the guise of a silly shoot-'em-up, even if those ideas are eventually given short shrift."
0,"Compared to the humor in the ""Iron Man"" movies or the vigilante themes in the recent ""Batman"" series, this reboot癤?has little to offer."
0,"For all its playfulness, the new ""RoboCop"" can't help but lack the novelty of the original's jolting mixture of dumb-smart irony and visceral pulp."
1,"This is at heart a pretty sad movie. Verhoeven wouldn't be caught dead making you care about anything in his ""RoboCop""; Padilha is after something different."
0,Whose bright idea was this?
1,"Slightly squarer and less subversive than the other one, but also admirable in its refusal to simply replicate the circuitry of a blockbuster predecessor."
1,"Thanks to a good cast and a willingness to stray fairly far afield from the source material, it's better than you might think."
0,An ostensibly mindless entertainment that doesn't content itself with mere sensationalism but goes out of its way to insult whatever intelligence the audience might have.
1,"Most people will go see this film for the extensive gun play and the body count, which of course make for swell entertainment. But you don't have to pull back the curtain very far here to see the drone that will soon hover over your neighborhood."
1,"This ''RoboCop'' has updated the dystopia with some clever ideas and better acting, while at the same time sanitizing any satire with video-game polish and sequel baiting."
1,RoboCop is a solid near-future action pic that poses moral questions about artificial intelligence and remote-control combat systems without getting too preachy or ponderous about it.
0,"Cynical, boring, PG-13 retread."
0,"Neither Alex Murphy's internal moral conflict nor the larger, vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake, which raises the question of what is meant to be the point."
1,"It's well made, polished, and hits every mark - but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun?"
1,"It fully justifies its existence. That doesn't mean it's especially good. But it's a rare ""reboot"" that transcends its studio's money-grubbing. It has some Big Ideas."
0,"An action adventure that's graphics-rich, logic-poor, coherence-challenged and pleasure-impaired."
1,"I'll take the original any day, but this is still fun, and the cast is first-rate."
1,RoboCop becomes less a work of aspirational coolness and more a piece of political satire - and not necessarily a bad one.
0,"There are some interesting things about ""RoboCop,"" and - no, wait, that's a lie."
1,It retains the central ideas and themes of the original while updating and rearranging the narrative to lose a derivative feel.
1,"The film has lots of energized mayhem, and Murphy's unraveling of the conspiracy against him isn't dumbed down, yet it's as if the comic-book action poetry of the original has been encased in a suit of generic armor."
1,"With a host of others, Padilha and screenwriter Joshua Zetumer concoct a bubbling stew of terror-streaked social satire and teary domestic drama."
0,"Surveying the peculiar array of 1980s retreads clustered into release this week, I'm reminded of Marty McFly in Back to the Future Part II, traveling forward in time 30 years to discover that everything is still the same, only worse."
1,"The Brazilian director Jos챕 Padilha may be working for a Hollywood studio but he doesn't temper his critique of American imperialism, big business and political corruption."
1,"Padilha is Brazilian, and it's interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries' curdled politics."
0,This Robo-reboot tries fiercely to update the satirical punch and stylistic perversity Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original. It's a futile gesture.
1,"Long on nostalgia, the film does shed further light on the genius of Brian Wilson and the unfair uproar over the Monkees' need for musical backup. Turns out even the Beach Boys required the Wrecking Crew to rock."
1,"The enchanting Kaye - ""I was making more money than the President"" - probably deserves her own film."
1,"It's astounding to consider how many eternal earworms are in our brains, courtesy of this accomplished group of West Coast musicians."
1,"These unsung heroes are the subject of an illuminating, witty and comprehensive documentary by Denny Tedesco, son of the Crew's inventive guitarist, the late Tommy Tedesco."
1,"With a son's love and duty, Tedesco ... breezily celebrates the team that laid down a thousand riffs back just before pop became too serious for anonymous craftsmanship."
1,Fascinating ...
1,"Though their story has taken decades to reach the screen, it has been worth the wait."
1,Denny Tedesco's lively and loving documentary takes its title from the name collectively applied to the group of two to three dozen Los Angeles studio musicians who dominated rock and pop recordings there during the 1960s and early '70s.
1,"With its release held up for seven years because of rights issues, Denny Tedesco's illuminating documentary about the unsung L.A. session musicians who provided the backbeat for some of the greatest songs from the '50s through the '80s can now be seen."
1,"The studio musicians rarely got credit on or off the albums. In The Wrecking Crew, Denny Tedesco, whose father was a Wrecking Crew guitarist, rights that wrong."
1,The unsung heroes who played on stacks of wax during the '60s pop era are celebrated in a hugely entertaining documentary.
0,"Mostly, it's hagiography, with stars like Cher and Brian Wilson used as character witnesses to the players' greatness."
1,"It'll make you listen to ""Good Vibrations,"" a song you've heard a million times, with fresh ears."
1,"It can be uncomfortable to pull back the curtain on some of the most beloved rock songs of all time. Yet, it's worth it in order to meet The Wrecking Crew."
1,"""The Wrecking Crew"" succeeds as important cultural history. But it's also deeply personal for Tedesco ..."
1,Good-natured look at the virtuoso workhorses of classic rock and pop.
1,A must-see for liner-note readers.
1,It all feels more like an ambitious home video than a 'proper' film.
1,It's a fascinating insight into how a classic song is crafted.
1,"Tedesco nails the point: that the beauty of pop music lies not with the prancing pop starlets, but in the hands of the average-looking, insanely talented artists behind the scenes."
1,"Closing the Ring is well-acted throughout and it has a romantic appeal that is not to be sneered at, even if some may find it bland."
0,It would be a flinty heart indeed that fails to be touched by the rheumy-eyed playing of MacLaine and her co-star Christopher Plummer.
0,"The film hangs on themes of lost love, longing and lies buried deep in family history, but with a tonne of sentimentality and mawkishness to carry it really drags its feet."
0,"With all the will in the world, this is a mere footnote to Attenborough's distinguished filmography."
1,"Attenborough is a past master at this type of drama, and he confidently shifts between the decades, avoiding the confusion so common to non-linear films like this."
0,Closing the Ring needed to find a context for its free-flowing emotions.
0,"Teenagers will love this film. They will love it because there are lots of close-ups of Barnes being done unto or doing unto others. As a vehicle for a rising and undeniably talented star, it hits the spot."
1,"These are interesting ideas, but they would work better if there was more decadence on show earlier on to nail Gray's corruption."
0,"Some neat formal flourishes from its director Oliver Parker and a truly handsome supporting turn from Colin Firth, this story demands a more versatile and charismatic central player than the powerfully blank Ben Barnes."
1,"It has the style of a Hammer shocker from decades ago; Wilde's romance is caricatured, certainly, but the whole thing is socked over with gusto."
1,"Beyond mildly risqu챕 bisexual assignations, the filmmaking isn't terribly adventurous, but cinematographer Roger Pratt gives it an inky opulence, and it's quite watchable."
0,"Parker directs his version like a kid who, after one too many Haribos, has been let loose with a bumper-pack of poster paints."
1,"It is a fairly good-looking film, but eccentrically cast - Ben Barnes is insufficiently charismatic in the central role - and the real problem is that while it has some effective moments of horror it is, as a drama, peculiarly inert."
0,"Parker's staging and direction are hopelessly inert; the orgy scenes are knocked off from Eyes Wide Shut, while the later movement into darkness looks (and sounds) like a cheap slasher movie."
1,"While Wilde's wit remains firmly entrenched, there's also a gruesome vein of gothic horror, and elements of the original which existed in the subtext or were merely hinted at are brought graphically into the open."
0,"The director, Randall Miller, appears to be trying to cross a bad Elmore Leonard thriller with a bad indie-festival family-angst comedy."
0,"Lacking the polish and coherence worthy of its cast, Nobel Son is no prize winner."
0,"Nobel Son sadistically resurrects the Tarantino knockoff -- an unloved, foul-mouthed little bastard of a subgenre that should now go away forever."
0,"I enjoyed Eliza Dushku's mad poetess, probably for the wrong reasons, but with a project this meager, you take your artful sneers and scenic diversions where you can get them."
1,The plot by itself could have become tiresome; no audience enjoys spending all evening walking into stone walls. But the acting is another matter.
1,"Although sometimes too self-consciously odd for its own good, the film is at times rollicking good fun, with Alan Rickman having a ball offending everyone within earshot as the brilliant, self-centered Eli Michaelson."
0,"The plot twists are mostly predicated on the characters' improbably shifting loyalties, the sort of thing you can get away with only when the people in your movie are drained of all compassion."
0,"It's one of those films stuffed with odd characters in overblown situations. Unfortunately, you don't care about any of them."
0,"Even if you can summon some admiration for Nobel Son's editing or snippets of clever dialogue, the movie is so relentlessly self-congratulatory, you can't help becoming thoroughly sick of it."
0,Only when Nobel Son stops trying so hard does it have any appeal at all.
0,"Like the worst of holiday quarrels, it's much more irritating than interesting, and by the end of it you'll be filled with as much seasonal cheer as Ebenezer Scrooge."
0,"Except for a mildly engaging heist scene in the middle of the movie, the story never gets within a mile of the Quentin Tarantino classics it tries to evoke."
0,"A snarky, blackly comic crime drama, the whole thing unfolds like the feverish Welsh Rarebit dream of Guy Ritchie's chauffeur."
1,"Fans of Rickman will appreciate the actor's sneering mix of buffoonery and misanthropy, Steenburgen gives another of her playfully ironic turns, and Miller's direction allows for few, if any, lulls."
0,Nobel Son is a dreary little thriller that irritates more than it thrills.
0,"Nobel Son isn't funny enough for black comedy, nor suspenseful enough for a thriller; for all its flashy flailings and thumb-slicings, it's ultimately a little dull."
1,[An] uneven but enjoyably titillating black comedy.
0,"It's all wildly implausible and occasionally fun, but it could be so much better if director Randall Miller had thrown in a little more character development and excised a half-dozen crazy plot twists."
1,Nobel Son is as darkly funny as it is exhilarating.
0,"Not flagrant enough to be vile, not original enough to be any good, Nobel Son does offer a rare opportunity to see Alan Rickman at his worst."
0,An aggressively noisy exercise in style over substance about nasty people doing nasty things to one another in (sigh) Southern California.
0,
0,Is it a thriller? Is it a heist movie? Is it a comedy?
0,"I had high hopes for Nobel Son at the halfway point, but it ultimately really completely collapses under the weight of its clever twists."

1,"The leads are charming, the comedy well judged and the script, however predictable, sure-footed, playing on notions of midlife nostalgia with grace and integrity."
1,"Amusing, wholesome fun for young teenage swooners who will squirm with horror at the adults who ought to know better."
0,"Check out 17 Again, an age-swap comedy co-starring Matthew Perry, only if you have daughters who will kill for a sight of heartthrob Zac Efron."
0,"An energetic but earthbound comic fantasy that borrows a few moves, if little inspiration, from Big and It's a Wonderful Life."
0,"Even with actors who echoed each other's mannerisms, 17 Again would still be lame."
0,"If this is one small step for the actor toward becoming a leading man, it is, for Hollywood movies, one more giant leap into infantilism."
0,"The idea of going back to high school is so overdone, there was even an entire episode of Family Guy that parodied it."
0,"A slack do-over fantasy in which Zac Efron, as a basketball star, looks baffled as to why he hasn't been asked to sing and dance."
1,17 Again is a comically responsible way for Efron to leave his teen roles behind and make his teen audience think about the adult decisions they now face.
1,"The kid may not be the next Sean Penn, but he is definitely a movie star."
0,"If you can't figure out what happens, you've never seen a movie. And if you haven't, please, God, don't start with this one."
1,"The result is lumpy and irritating, but 17 Again regroups whenever Efron is back on screen."
1,"Though not as clever as 13 Going on 30 or Freaky Friday, it's also not as hokey as Hannah. For a swoon-fest aimed at tweens, 17 Again has a lot going for it."
0,"Efron has no edge. And although that edgelessness might prolong his career, it keeps 17 Again from having anything surprising to say about teenage life in 2009."
0,"17 Again is product, loaded with high fructose corn syrup so the girls will like it, and as meaningful as an afternoon at the mall."
1,"For me, 17 Again is mildly diverting. For the tweens who are its target audience, Efron's outside shot is a three-pointer."
1,"Though Mann and Perry are game, it's Efron who carries the movie."
1,"With plenty of help from a fine supporting cast, Efron deftly handles the fish-out-of-water hijinks and slips through more icky May-September romantic entanglements than an average season of Friday Night Lights."
0,"The movie manages a few good jokes about inappropriate flirtations, but it never addresses the bigger questions of why the marriage went wrong or what Mike is supposed to be doing about it."
1,"Funny and lively, with a healthy dollop of sentimentality, it reassures us that all is not lost, except maybe our six-pack abs, as we descend into schlubby, dissatisfied middle age."
1,The ancient body-switching premise is animated by a breezy script that briefly addresses some of its darker implications before returning to a celebration of adolescence.
1,"17 Again is pleasant, harmless PG-13 entertainment, with a plot a little more surprising and acting a little better than I expected."
1,"Efron, as a teen with the brain of a father, ably carries this featherweight movie."
1,There's evidence that the young heartthrob might make a decent leading man if only he'd apply himself.
0,Wholesome just isn't as wholesome as it used to be.
0,17 Again makes the '80s comedies on which it's modeled seem positively cutting-edge by comparison.
1,"Despite occasional misfires, this Zac Efron comedy earns its laughs and delivers its life lessons."
1,"I found him a sympathetic, and strangely believable, middle-aged dad."
0,"Can't we just watch Freaky Friday again? Really, I'd take either version at this point."
0,"It could be better, it could be worse."
1,"17 Again takes a while to get cooking, and at times it just feels like a pale imitation of 13 Going on 30. Still, it's often breezily entertaining, partly thanks to Efron, who certainly knows how to be cute."
0,"If you're looking for the performance that might one day be characterized as Efron's embarrassing breakout role, this is a good bet."
1,"17 Again isn't a sophisticated work of art, nor was it intended to be. It's often silly, sometimes fun silly, sometimes too silly."
0,17 Again makes Xeroxes look original.
0,"Zac Efron, looking cool, is movie enough for the makers of 17 Again, a halfhearted fantasy that stars Efron in a role cryogenically frozen around the time of C. Thomas Howell's '80s heyday."
0,"The filmmakers don't give their viewers credit for a minimum level of observation and, as a result, have produced a sloppy, lazy motion picture."
0,"Keeps people and things moving fast enough so that you don't have time to worry about the details, like the inanity of the story."
1,"It's silly, but the generational love matches it entrains."
1,"17 Again is good-humoured, pacy and exactly the right kind of entertainment for its target audience."
0,
0,"There was nothing here that was particularly funny, new, or inventive."
0,I was disappointed.
1,
0,"While The Good Life is stylistically ambitious and heartfelt, it feels more forced than authentic."
1,"It's one of those reliable old cast-against-type comic turns that sends the character on a funny, predictable journey of sobering revelation."
1,The hilarious thing about Tooth Fairy is that it is a genuinely camp comedy.
0,"Tooth Fairy is a strictly by-the-numbers affair, except when Merchant is clowning around. He doesn't make you enjoy the film so much as he makes you wish he acted more. Guess that's something."
0,"It's a step backward for Johnson, a charismatic performer who was much better in Race to Witch Mountain. A few more films like this, and he may be back to professional wrestling."
0,"As Fred Claus ham-fisted as this is, the glint of what might have been a cute kids' comedy still glimmers in random moments. But that Disney touch (which even Disney has trouble replicating) is missing."
0,"The motivation for this scenario, obviously, is that someone thought it would be hilarious to see The Rock wearing wings and a tutu. Not that I dispute this, but it's hardly enough to hang a movie on."
1,"Tooth Fairy isn't half bad, outfitted with gently funny high jinks that place its brawny lead in progressively ridiculous circumstances."
1,"A serendipitous combination of star (Dwayne Johnson), material and director (Michael Lembeck), this tale of an arrogant hockey player, forced to serve time in wings and a pastel-colored tutu, scores a goal for kids and adults alike."
0,A clumsy fable populated with cloying kids and a predictable hold-on-to-your-dreams message.
0,"As you may have guessed, this is purely synthetic, assembly-line stuff, with messages like ""Dreams are good for everyone."" As a result Johnson overcompensates, amping up his typical enthusiasm until it feels uncharacteristically false."
0,"Although it starts out as a sports comedy, Tooth Fairy quickly turns into a shamelessly derivative fantasy about the value of making things up."
0,"Perhaps the best thing about it is the sight of a hulking Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in a pink tutu and big feathery wings. Otherwise this silly story and barely there comedy is about as enjoyable as a root canal."
0,The Rock can't handle the tooth.
0,"Hey, how funny would it be to put Dwayne Johnson in ballerina slippers, pink tights, and a tutu? Not very. But here's the movie anyway, scarcely more than the pitch meeting that spawned it."
0,"For a bad, broad comedy, Tooth Fairy boasts a surprising number of positives. Which isn't to say that it's good, but it could be much, much worse."
0,"Director Michael Lembeck shows little imagination in what could have been a quirkier, more interesting kids tale. He does direct surprisingly good hockey sequences, though, including an overhead shot of an airborne tooth."
0,"Johnson's a game and antic presence, but saddled with this material -- credited to five screenwriters, including Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel -- he comes perilously close to tiring out the audience with all the nervous activity and the mugging."
0,"There's no way I can recommend this movie to anyone much beyond the Tooth Fairy Believement Age, but I must testify it's pleasant and inoffensive, although the violence in the hockey games seems out of place."
0,Tooth Fairy makes the mistake of having too many anxious hockey players remain on the ice after their shift has ended.
0,"Like most family films nowadays, the movie squanders a lot of energy righteously huffing and puffing its message: let kids dream."
0,"As dental experiences go, Tooth Fairy doesn't hurt as much as you might think."
0,The marvelously handsome wrestler-turned-actor -- proving once again better than the material he takes -- dons tights and a baby-blue satin tunic in the slight family comedy Tooth Fairy.
0,"The problem is, Derek is not redeemable. Even after he's been to magic fairy land, he continues to behave like a jerk, because that is the natural state of his being."
1,"One of the film's charms is the way it carries childhood mythology to its logical, if absurd extreme."
0,"Basically, if you've seen the ads, you've seen the only joke in this one-joke movie, although there are also endless groan-worthy gags about wings and teeth."
1,"Kids won't mind any of The Tooth Fairy's flaws and will find the sight of burly Johnson in a pink tutu hilarious. Parents get a couple of clever gags that will make them forgive the filmmakers. And if we all remember to floss, everybody wins."
0,Dwayne Johnson in shiny tights. Dwayne Johnson throwing around magic pixie dust. Dwayne Johnson flying around like a clumsy Tinkerbell. Wait. You're still not laughing?
0,"CGI fairy dust, dippy tooth puns and a semi-amusing Billy Crystal cameo can't disguise the fact that this sugary distraction is as hollow as a cavity."
1,The feeling upon walking out of Tooth Fairy closely resembles the notion one often has upon leaving the dentist -- that wasn't nearly as bad as expected.
0,Is there anything else to say except skip it?
0,The one element that lifts this above utter tedium is the presence of Stephen Merchant as tooth-fairy administrator Tracy. That he manages to come away with his dignity intact is testament to his skill as a comedian.
0,"It has the plastic, disinfected aroma of something straight off the assembly line."
0,"Although the film gets over the preposterousness of its own premise early enough, the tooth/truth puns are exhausted to a fault, assumedly aimed at giving adults something to titter at."
0,"It has a terrible screenplay and you get the feeling that Johnson could be a much better light comedian than this, given a better chance."
0,"A brave actor if not a technically dazzling one, Brosnan gives a moving performance, but he's constantly undercut by the predictability of Allen's woes."
0,No one -- not Brosnan's shell-shocked-by-numbers patriarch nor Mulligan's wide-eyed waif -- comes out of this steroidal pity party unscathed.
1,The usual grumpy cynics will undoubtedly call it sentimental and manipulative. Ignore them.
0,"Unfortunately, though its heart is smack in the right place, The Greatest tends to play more like a collection of appropriate, well-acted scenes than as a fully satisfying narrative."
1,A well-observed study of an affluent family's grief and rebirth after a tragic accident.
1,"The Greatest pulls off a stunning fete, drawing an audience into a comprehensive film about grief."
1,The Greatest takes a piece out of you.
0,The movie might have resonated more if it threw out some of the grief-counseling cliches and let the idiosyncrasies of the characters dictate more of the drama.
0,The movie suffocates as scene after shouty scene delivers nothing except yet another variant of the notion that it's a bummer to lose a loved one.
0,Dignity dies a million deaths despite the best intentions.
0,"Not even the skillful performances of its stars, Susan Sarandon and Pierce Brosnan, playing the boy's parents, can cover up the mysterious gaps in continuity of a screenplay whose thudding dialogue spells out every emotion."
0,It's when the small moments become large ones that Feste overreaches and the shaky performances don't bail her out.
0,What a waste of a talented cast!
1,I think that the performances and also the kind of relaxed style of direction kind of make this watchable.
1,"Any good actor's career involves a certain amount of toning-up of questionable material, adding dimensions where they're barely suggested on the page. That's what Mulligan is doing here."
0,"Although The Greatest is a histrionic mess, at least it looks clean."
0,"Sarandon and Brosnan are very good, indeed, Brosnan surprisingly so. In fact, Brosnan has never been so opened up, so emotional and yet so precise in his work. It's a lovely performance in a film that only sometimes deserves him."
1,"Though it sometimes feels more like a collection of scenes than a complete story, some moments are so raw and insightful that they feel like a punch to the heart."
1,What makes The Greatest work so well is that Feste clearly remembers what it's like to be 18 and to believe your one chance at joy has passed you by.
0,Do not mistake The Greatest for a movie about Muhammad Ali. And do not think its ambitious title indicates its overall quality.
0,"There's some good acting and a few nice moments. But far from being The Greatest, the movie itself is merely middling."
0,"It's earnest and grueling and gently contrived, and it lets several good performers play at repressing their feelings before letting them rip in jagged arias of Acting. I wanted to like the movie more than I did; your mileage may vary."
0,The Greatest includes a great performance and a very good one at the center of vagueness and confusion.
0,"Overwrought in all the wrong ways, The Greatest doesn't do its normally excellent cast any favors."
1,"A meditation on loss by a writer-director whose honesty, sensitivity and intelligence more than mitigate the film's histrionic qualities."
1,"The real surprise is Brosnan's silent, agonized performance; his post-007 career has been one long campaign to prove he's got the goods."
0,The flimsy plot -- less a whodunit than an isn't-it-screamingly-obvious-that-that-guy-done-it! -- will have thriller fans singing the blues.
0,"Rachel Samuels' thin, affected jazz-age noir Dark Streets is worse than most, grafting an indifferent series of twists and double-crosses onto a blues-nightclub backdrop that overwhelms the foreground."
0,"It's a lovingly souped-up incarnation of the film-noir look, contains well-staged and performed musical numbers, and has a lot of cigarettes, tough tootsies, bad guys and shadows. What it doesn't have is a story that pulls us along."
0,"This charmless fantasy tries to recapture the mix of hot jazz and cold cynicism that lit up Chicago, adding a dash of punk for good measure"
0,"Feebly mixing film noir and the old-time nightclub musical, Dark Streets could do with illumination in more ways than one."
0,"Dark Streets has atmosphere coming out its ears, but not much going on between them."
0,"I love musicals, but I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this curiosity."
0,"Dark Streets lost me early, real early, like still-adjusting-my-eyes-in-a-dark-theater early: Welcome to the blues, growls the entertainer with the mohawk and the full-length ringmaster gown."
0,"An unwieldy combination of film noir and film musical, Dark Streets doesn't manage to be effective on either level."
0,
1,Even the pivotal weakness of [Tom] Long's dull persona can't undermine the pic's determination to confront auds intellectually and emotionally.
1,"The premise is provocative but the film lingers too long on the scenes of imprisonment, turning them into a kind of soft-porn performance art and leaving the emotional aftershocks less satisfyingly explored."
0,An adaptation of novelist Rupert Thomson's erotic mystery/thriller that fails to find a visual or narrative equivalent for the book's elegant prose and lubricious mysteries.
1,"There's a fine and committed performance by Long, who looks like a pretty, young Nick Cave, but the women are never anything more than agents of the central conceit, the missing link in an otherwise psychologically intriguing film."
1,"Shot like a lush, hypnotic waking dream, it's boldly beautiful and plays some half-smart games with sex, power and gender politics."
0,"[A] sometimes unbearably slow, uneven melodrama that's not without a few powerful sequences."
0,[The film] goes down like medicine.
1,So vivid and convincingly realistic is the physical depiction of Baghdad in the early days of the American occupation that the introduction of trumped-up thriller elements feels like an unwanted intrusion.
1,"An energetic, frenzied thriller -- Paul Greengrass-style -- set in Iraq in the chaotic post-invasion days."
0,Green Zone approaches every human activity as if preparing to defibrillate.
1,It's only the adrenaline-inducing techniques that conceal the lack of imagination.
1,You catch your breath only to have the wind knocked out by the mirage of the carefree scene around the Green Zone swimming pool.
0,Green Zone isn't so much a bad movie as a misguided one.
0,"Green Zone is a strangely dated, foolishly grandiose, simplistically angry fictional war-zone thriller about how one patriot blows the lid off America's missteps in Iraq."
0,"Chandrasekaran's book is a work of sharp, informative journalism. That ""inspired by"" credit sounds a little insulting when the result is tired, standard action fare such as Green Zone."
1,"It's certainly interesting to see what's been reported on the manipulation of information played out as drama, and the acting is uniformly good."
0,"Shot by Barry Ackroyd, the same cinematographer who filmed The Hurt Locker, and using the same camera techniques, this movie looks like outtakes from a much better film."
0,"Seven years into the Iraq quagmire, we need more from our political filmmakers than an angry fist (and a hand-held camera) shaken in the Bush administration's direction."
1,"As expected, Greengrass smoothly integrates the suspense and tension of a Hollywood thriller with a ground-level depiction of American chicanery in the chaotic days after the fall of Baghdad."
1,"For a popcorn flick, it has style and smarts. And while it's not an actors' film, it offers solid performances."
1,Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of Green Zone is the manner in which it interweaves fact and fiction into an engaging whole.
0,"Green Zone is partly real and partly, increasingly, fantastic and outlandish in its wishful thinking."
1,"Yes, the film is fiction, employs farfetched coincidences and improbably places one man at the center of all the action. It is a thriller, not a documentary."
1,Distills -- not simplifies -- the clashing forces that dashed our chance of peace. Greengrass is economical in his scenes; the film bolts forward like a greyhound chasing a lure.
0,Reduces policies that caused the deaths of thousands to the equivalent of a first-person-shooter video game.
1,"Green Zone hits hard and doesn't forgive. It plays out like fiction, and in some ways it is. But in too many ways, it's not."
1,"When Mr. Greengrass made United 93, his 2006 reconstruction of one of the Sept. 11 hijackings, some people fretted that it was too soon. My own response to Green Zone is almost exactly the opposite: it's about time."
0,"Damon's the anchor, a fine one at that, but even he can't seem to hold the filmmakers' attention for long."
0,Manufacturing thrills takes precedence over any kind of journalistic insight.
1,An urgent piece of work.
1,"A jangly, noisy, compulsively restless thriller on a par with the Bourne movies, shot through with political critique."
1,"Politics aside and purely as a piece of genre moviemaking, Green Zone is a solid example of a political paranoia thriller."
0,What Chandrasekaran did so well -- tenaciously cataloging the colossal morass of America's small and not-so-small mistakes -- Greengrass eschews for the popcorn-crunching conventions of a Hollywood potboiler.
1,"Too little and too late? Maybe. But even in this Bourne Zone, Damon and Greengrass haven't shirked their duty to enlighten and entertain."
1,"This is a movie that recognizes there's no straight line to the truth, which is part of what makes it vaguely unsatisfying -- though it's also what keeps it honest."
1,"It's a tribute to Matt Damon's special quality as an actor -- not his star wattage, but his ability to project a certain simple human decency -- that we care about him even when we only see the side of his head..."
1,"Green Zone is far from perfect. But man, oh, man, as a pulse-pounding thriller, it is a knockout."
1,Green Zone has an attitude -- it persuades in almost documentary style that the war was sold on false pretences but no one's motives in this tangled affair can be completely trusted.
0,Green Zone weakens its claim to authenticity with fictional fudgings. And the weakening works both ways.
1,"Intelligent, tough and gripping."
1,This is a red-hot action thriller that deals candidly and unapologetically with the situation in Iraq.
0,"The movie might have seemed a revelation if it had been released six or seven years ago, but there's no fresh angle, few surprises and no character who steps boldly forward to suggest heroism or corruption."
0,It takes a complex and important story and renders it facile. Characters are etched too clearly in black and white.
0,"In the wake of the Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker -- a far better film, and one with a less strident, less obvious agenda -- Green Zone arrives looking strangely anachronistic."
0,"If tremulous 100-yard-dash camerawork is Greengrass's voice, this sort of movie might not be the song for him."
0,"Green Zone has technical flair, but we expect more from Greengrass."
1,Green Zone is probably the nearest the Americans will get to the public floggings of the Chilcot Inquiry except there will be popcorn on hand and a far larger audience.
1,"Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost."
1,It is a welcome addition to an ongoing post-mortem.
1,"I can't believe people will not go to see Green Zone in their droves. I certainly hope they do, for it is a shocking, replenishing film, not to be missed."
1,"Greengrass, with his superkinetic camerawork and visceral sense of you-are-there immediacy, pieces together a compelling picture of a ground force trying (and failing) to order a city on the slide towards anarchy."
1,"Competent, vivid and more than tokenistically controversial in theme."
0,"Breathless, yes, but oddly disengaged, in the first Greengrass project yet where you feel he's delivering just on par."
0,"Paul Greengrass's loud, Damon-driven documentary-style thriller confusingly weaves fact and fiction and whipsaws between various conspiracy theories, while the nonstop action mimics an Xbox splatter game."
0,"It's one thing for the filmmakers to (sort of) fictionalize real people, but Green Zone wraps up with a wish-fulfillment fantasy that is about as believable as watching reinforcements riding in to save Custer."
0,Green Zone is the rare miss from frequent collaborators Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass.
0,
0,"I don't like polemics, not even those supporting my position. This film does not support my position...the movie contains far too little in terms of a coherent, believable plot."
1,"The film is a visual and verbal treat as Elliott prowls a stately home and its verdant, foggy grounds with an eye and an ear for puncturing pomposity in all its forms."
1,"A fine cast makes sure Noel Coward's champagne remains bubbly in Easy Virtue, an effervescent entertainment."
1,"Overall, the film's never less than lively - with Kris Marshall a nifty scene-stealer as the wise butler - yet you do get the sense that greater discipline all round would have made even more of it. As it is, it's fizzy, but variable."
0,"But worst of all is the incessant, unbearably smug soundtrack that drills its way into your brain like a parasite."
0,"Firth and Biel perform a rather elegant tango together, which cheers things up a little, but this is a heavy-footed affair."
1,If you can cope with the excruciating soundtrack medley (a jazz cover of Sex Bomb?) it's a perfectly jolly bauble.
0,What did No챘l Coward do to deserve Stephan Elliott's cackhanded film of his play Easy Virtue?
0,"Altogether a shambles, and perhaps uniquely in the Coward canon, it features not a single laugh."
0,It amounts to much ado about almost nothing. But that may be the result of Elliott's attempt to make it entertaining rather than plausible.
1,"It is a sure-footed, entertaining period piece, a revamp of a Noel Coward play from the '20s that never takes itself too seriously, yet never treats its source material with contempt."
1,"There are some very ragged segues but thanks to Biel's sparkle and Firth's unexpected flair for the tango, honesty finally trumps hypocrisy and the pacey ending sends you out on a high."
1,"The laughter found in Easy Virtue requires a sophisticated cinematic palate, but for those who appreciate this sort of motion picture, it's a top-notch creation."
1,Stephan Elliott's deliciously cheeky screen adaptation of one of the satirist's lesser-known jabs at the British upper crust will charm your pants off.
1,"All told, a sparkling, classy and ultimately satisfying experience."
0,Coward's champagne-fizz lightness has never felt so labored; nothing here comes easy.
0,"We're primed for an old-fashioned cat fight, but director Stephan Elliot can't get more fangs from Biel than a kitten."
0,The fizz falls flat.
0,"Easy Virtue needs a strong center to justify its celebration of American effrontery, and Biel lacks that prideful edge."
1,Goes down as light and fizzily as a flute of Champagne tossed back in an airy drawing room.
0,"The first Noel Coward play to hit the big screen in more than 40 years, Easy Virtue is a crass, heavy- handed and -- most unfor givably -- largely laugh-free adaptation of The Master's infrequently revived 1924 comic melodrama."
0,In its cold-eyed assessment of the English aristocracy Easy Virtue has none of the lurking Anglophilia found in Merchant-Ivory movies.
1,The elegant barbed wit of Noel Coward bubbling up in a time of Wolverine grunts. I must be dreaming.
0,
0,"Funny, but ordinary."
1,Biel delivers the best performance of her young career.
1,"Jessica Biel in a teacup-rattling '20s period piece? With her lewd pinup grin and husky flat voice, she sticks out like a sore starlet in Easy Virtue -- but that's the whole point in this loosely 'freshened up' version of a No챘l Coward play."
0,There's supposed to be some distance between the main character and the family she marries into ??but that distance probably shouldn't include acting styles.
0,Those coming in cold may be forgiven for thinking they've wandered into Atonement remade as a farce.
0,"Easy Virtue has enough traces of Coward's wit to keep you hoping for the first hour or so, but then the film collapses under the weight of too many misguided innovations."
1,"Unusually for a play by Noel Coward, Love struggles while conquering All in Easy Virtue, a subversive view of British country-house society between the wars."
0,"The only characters who seem anchored in some form of reality are the hero's parents...all the others, from siblings to servants, are standard-issue eccentrics or the subjects of running gags."
1,"[Director] Elliott had a choice in Easy Virtue, to turn away from the horror or face it. He takes his time, but he eventually does face it -- and delivers up a good movie."
0,Full of gorgeous architecture and sightlines but a bit too cold for comfort and with an all-too pervasive air of tedium.
0,"Elliott nearly turns the whole affair into a musical, with characters singing snatches of Coward and Cole Porter songs. But his sense of humor is extremely broad."
0,"It lumbers instead of dazzles, drags where it should feint and jab."
0,"What might've been a scrumptious, chocolatey dessert of a movie -- a Noel Coward delite -- is instead a scoop of lemon ice, not filling, faintly sweet and mostly water."
0,"Full of forced jocularity and drawing-room hissy fits, with its cast parading around in vintage threads and antique cars, Easy Virtue is a close-to-insufferable souffle based on the 1925 Noel Coward play."
0,"Jessica Biel gets more publicity for her body and her boyfriend than for her acting ability, but Easy Virtue may be cause for a reassessment."
0,"Easy Virtue has all the elements for a sprightly romp with serious underpinnings, and occasionally it achieves that balance. But it's marred by attempts at farce that are as belabored as they are ill-advised."
1,"A winning, witty fox trot through the Roaring 20s, when men were men, women were liberating themselves and the 'to the manner born' were losing their grip on their manners -- and manors."
1,"These are good actors telling a good story, so the virtue is indeed easy to grasp, and a fine time should be had by all."
1,"Echoing the words of the great Porter song, Easy Virtue deliciously misbehaves."
0,
1,What begins as a poignant tribute to filmmaker Kurt Kuenne's dead best friend snowballs into a gut-wrenching true-crime story.
1,"A true-crime story so gripping, devastating, and ultimately unforgettable that it easily trumps any thriller Hollywood has to offer this year."
1,"The facts are so awful that Dear Zachary can be forgiven much of its antsiness -- as a memorial, as a condolence to Bagby's parents (who became activists for judicial reform in their late son's honor), and as a howl of grief."
1,A four-handkerchief documentary if there ever was one.
1,"It is impossible not to be fired up by Kurt Kuenne's incendiary cri de coeur, Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father."
1,"Dear Zachary earns its right to engage us on a primal level, but it comes on the heels of so many films that don't, movies that...prey on modern fears and inflate third-rate material to the plane of tragedy."
1,"An undeniably shattering story, if forgivably shaky in its impassioned, therapeutic unfolding."
1,A slick account of ancient crevices in the human psyche rendered in cutting-edge cinematic style.
1,Just take our advice and bring tissues. You're going to need them.
1,
1,"Gorgeous, informative and as gripping as a shark's jaws."
1,One of the most fun and engaging IMAX movies to date.
1,"Here to inspire awe and depression with a vast universe of marine life that, barring possible ecological disaster, will be here eons after we're gone."
1,"After 40 minutes behind 3-D glasses watching rare aquatic creatures, why bother with airline tickets and scuba gear?"
1,"It's that kind of detail that makes a the film such an immersive experience. An educational one, too."
1,"If you have children who might be diverted by 40 minutes of natural wonders, and you can get to an Imax cinema, then Under the Sea 3D is a treat."
1,"Even about halfway in, even having settled into your seat with those plastic glasses nestled on your nose, you'll still find yourself dazzled again and again by the impossibly breathtaking beauty of the IMAX adventure Under the Sea 3D."
1,"The plot may not be much -- amazing creatures live in the sea and if we keep polluting the world a bunch of them will die, so let's stop being such jerks -- but the visuals are absolutely fantastic."
1,"If you're not taking the family on an exotic beach vacation anytime soon, consider this a reasonable alternative."
1,The 3-D effects are uncanny; much of the audience ducked when sea snakes lunged at it. You can't get that on your TV set. Yet.
0,"Oceanic movies in actual science museums are far more interesting and nuanced than this documentary -- not to mention the wildly popular Planet Earth series, which even in 2-D looks better."
1,As intimate and enjoyable as anything Imax has done in 3-D.
1,"This is the fourth Imax underwater excursion, and the second in 3-D, and it may just be the best yet."
1,"Under the Sea 3D is one of the best of the genre. If it doesn't serve oysters, per se, this submarine wonder offers marvels in abundance."
1,"The images are impressive, and include shots of some cuttlefish 'hey-hey' cleverly set to the song Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps (the theme song for the Britcom Coupling)."
1,No computer-designed animatronic invention can begin to match the beauty and grace of the oceanic life photographed in Under the Sea 3D.
1,"This is a raw, brutal arena of cold-eyed predators chomping the weakest and inexpressibly ugly beings that have evolved so as to be disturbingly well camouflaged, utterly invisible until they make a deadly lunge at some poor vulnerable little fishy."
1,Under the Sea 3D is a beautiful reminder that movies can take us to places we've never been before. There are still worlds to conquer out there that don't require the gussying up of CGI effects to hold our attention.
1,"It's impossible not to be wowed by some of the images in Under the Sea 3D, ?쮝he coolest of which are a nice ?쮚eminder that, even in the age of CG wizardry, the best special effects still come straight from Mother Nature."
1,"The footage is spectacular, the colors electric, the life aquatic trippier than anything you'll see in even the most wildly imaginative animated fare."
0,
0,
1,"while this is not quite Heathers, the high school setting allows for some amiable teen satire to give all those rotting corpses a certain freshness."
0,"Ungainly mix of gritty street-life drama, perky teen romance and seriocomic sci-fi time-tripping never jells."
0,Ray's script shambles off in all directions and succeeds only in reinforcing our disbelief.
0,The final third of the script feels like an afterthought in a film that cannot bring any plausibility to its gritty setting nor its characters' plight because it began with an inherently sentimental plot device.
1,"There are moments, especially when Welles is alternating between acting as Brutus and directing everyone else, that it's possible to forget you're watching an actor and really believe you're beholding Orson Welles at work."
1,"Quippy, fast, and enjoyably corny, Welles is like a musical comedy without songs."
1,"This is a standard coming-of-age story set in a milieu that's anything but standard, and that's what keeps the picture's motor running."
0,"As in life, the presence of Welles never fails to overtake things and McKay's command of the subject is so Welles-ian that when he's in a scene everyone else fades a little. And neither [Linklater] nor the film ever quite recover from that."
0,"It's slight, only sporadically enjoyable and sometimes corny."
0,A terminally bland coming-of-age story about a pretty young man with the world창(TM)s most awesome after-school job.
1,"In a departure from his usual intimate, character-based fare, director Richard Linklater paints on a broad cinematic canvas that brings Depression-era Broadway vividly to life."
0,"I'm getting very weary of filmmakers making up conversations, inventing motives and creating events so that their ""based on a real story"" movie can get to ""the real truth."" Because, actually, there's only one real truth."
1,"The story of a teenager's sometimes uncomfortable brush with greatness, it is necessary viewing for anyone whose imagination has been seduced by the charms of art."
1,One of the best pictures about the stage in recent memory.
1,"Deft, affectionate, and unexpectedly enjoyable."
1,"Surprisingly conventional by director Richard Linklater's standards, this pleasant, low-key dramedy is most memorable for the discovery of co-star Christian McKay."
1,"Welles is brilliantly embodied by Christian McKay in one of those, hey-who's-that? performances that tends to draw Oscar talk, even if the film itself isn't much more than an extremely pleasant lark."
1,"What do you say about a movie that proves Zac Efron can act, introduces a master thespian in Christian McKay and launches a charm assault that is damn near irresistible?"
0,"Efron's fix on the period suggests a GPS struggling in a low-signal area, and the movie becomes an affectionate, name-dropping exercise in historical mutilation."
1,"You feel a little bit what it was like to sit in that theater on opening night. You also feel like what it was and what it still is to be a young person infatuated with writing, with art, with theater..."
1,"There's a strong ensemble flavour, characterised by the simultaneously selfish and clubbable tendencies of the actors, which makes for a lightly comic experience but also for a portrait of a theatre company that feels warm and true."
0,"The film fails as a character portrait, a drama or a snapshot of an era, while simultaneously offering tantalising hints of each. Apart from watching the rising star McKay strut his stuff, there's little to recommend in Me and Orson Welles."
0,"As so often with films reverently dealing with theatre folk, the directing itself becomes exasperatingly theatrical and inert."
1,A characteristic Richard Linklater film. And Richard Linklater films are characteristically very good indeed.
1,"Cleverly employing the florid self-consciousness of the theatre world into which it offers us a glimpse, Me and Orson Welles elicits an irresistible grin."
1,"Welles comes off as an imperious, duplicitous, philandering brat. But he's also funny, seductive, and ingenious."
1,"Look at Mackay. Look at the handsome-pudgy features, listen to the rolling bass voice, appraise the twinkling eye, marvel at the offhand flourishes of the titanic frame. This is Welles."
1,"Christian McKay's performance in the title role measures up to that extraordinariness, both inhabiting Welles's magnetic, overweening personality and approximating a decent physical likeness."
1,Comedy is never any good when it simply goes for laughs - and Linklater and his company have managed something of serious intent very well.
1,"Linklater keeps everything bouncing along, in sepia light and roar-of-the-greasepaint dust, giving us a little lesson in theater history along with an appealing coming-of-age tale."
1,"Linklater's film adaptation succeeds in bringing the flamboyant Welles to life, without resorting to caricature (although a few vintage Al Hirschfelds adorn the walls)."
1,"A real charmer, Me and Orson Welles is the work of a director who takes nostalgia, romantic possibility and the theater seriously, without being a pill about it."
1,"The impersonation of Welles by Christian McKay in Me and Orson Welles is the centerpiece of the film, and from it, all else flows. We can almost accept that this is the Great Man."
1,"Christian McKay's impersonation of young Orson Welles is sensational in this enjoyable, though slight, historical fiction about a teen who spends a memorable week with the legendary wonder."
1,"The very name Orson Welles stands for genius wasted and betrayed, and the movie offers some foreshadowing of his triumphs and failures to come."
1,A thoroughly enjoyable film that wraps a coming-of-age story around the portrait of a genius.
1,"It's an open question as to who, outside theater geeks, will find this inside-baseball approach quite as fascinating as Linklater apparently does."
1,I forgot that I was looking at an actor. I really believed I was looking at Welles.
0,"Working with the fact-based eponymous novel by Robert Kaplow, first-time screenwriters Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo are content to follow the contours of a standard behind-the-scenes story about the staging of a play."
1,"The most resonant voice belongs to Welles, or rather to McKay, who uncannily channels the charm, ego and flim-flammery of the man who would soon move to Hollywood to direct and star in Citizen Kane."
1,Christian McKay delivers a stand out performance in two of the best escapist hours you'll experience this year.

1,"Attractive cast, predictable girl-lives-dream story and lots of great dancing."
1,"Shankland's approach is oblique rather than graphic, but these icy chills will send shivers down your spine."
0,"The grown-ups, rather hysterically, blame each others' parenting skills. The plot promptly disintegrates into a gory struggle for credibility against appalling odds."
1,"The fundamentally disturbing and creepy aspects about such random and unpredictable child-centric mayhem are always present, no matter how ludicrously intense and darkly humorous things get."
1,This efficient British chiller ticks the right boxes.
0,"The idea of cosseted middle-class tots becoming feral psychopaths has potential, though most of it is squandered by uncertain direction and some unconvincing psychology."
1,"War Child, a documentary about the hip-hop artist Emmanuel Jal, is a bit ragged and repetitive, but certainly this young man's life is amazing proof that one person really can make a difference."
0,"An uplifting journey weighed down by dry, humdrum convention (attack of the talking heads!); this is social-studies homework, not nourishment for the soul."
1,"Garbage Warrior is, in the end, a fitting tribute to a free spirit and a valuable citizen."
0,"The green movement is eager for such heroes, but Garbage Warrior falls into the trap of so many documentaries that are more from the heart than the head: It's a timely subject, devoid of the rigour that might make it actually important."
0,"It fails, through its villainy; this trio of baddies resembles a dive-bar slumming suburban psychobilly band, no meth-breath hazards."
0,Unnecessary on every level save the paramount commercial one.
0,This film is only for those who go in with open eyes and understand what they're in for.
0,"This remake is merely vile (and dull), with a badly miscast Tony Goldwyn as the raging dad who makes revenge for his daughter's violation look more gratuitously brutal than the crime."
1,This is a horror movie that illustrates the difference between cringing and feeling.
0,Someone somewhere will probably try to foist The Last House on the Left remake off as some sort of social commentary. Don't be fooled. It's not.
0,Last House on the Left is so stomach-churningly anti-human it makes you wonder why Goldwyn...and Potter signed on.
1,"Sure, the movie is predictable (a convenient storm causes power outages and therefore the dark house is creepily candlelit and who knows who's lurking behind the door), but it keeps its audience on edge."
0,"Not only is it plodding and completely predictable, the carnage is rendered slowly and quasi-reverentially, making the whole brutal experience come off like torture porn."
0,This remake plods to its finale.
1,First-time director Dennis Iliadis spices up the visual style with unusual camera and cutting choices that liven the tempo beyond typical horror-movie clich챕. Time will tell whether or not this Last House launches his career.
0,Substitutes general 'intensity' for every thorny stylistic and political particulars that made Craven's film so singular.
1,"The Last House on the Left is the best in the latest crop of slasher remakes. Admittedly, that is faint praise."
1,"This film...is what it is: a stark story of bloodthirstiness quenched, first by the obvious antagonists, then by sympathetic, civilized characters who avenge the atrocities that have come before."
0,Audiences with a brain cell left have only one choice: Look for the first exit on the right.
1,"Its main goals are to shock, titillate, enrage and otherwise jolt your reflexes, which it does shrewdly and successfully."
0,I'm giving it a 2.5 in the silly star rating system and throwing up my hands.
0,"In the end, like virtually every other remake that has been released recently, it's polished and predictable."
0,A shockingly mundane disappointment taken on its own and a deeply misguided refraction of the original.
0,"Do not go to this movie if you simply seek entertainment. If you're a sociologist tracking the decline of civilization over the past four decades, you're in for a night of solid research."
1,The action scenes are particularly gripping.
1,"The remake is much glossier but also takes place mostly in real time, using long takes, genuinely disturbing violence and stretches with no dialogue to pin you to the story."
0,"Stripped of that sociological context, the extreme brutality here can't help but feel more than a little exploitative, especially where the film's female victims are concerned."
1,"A deliberate, underplayed horror movie that is truly shocking."
1,"Unlike the slew of Michael Bay- produced slasher remakes, this is not an idea-free flick. And Craven (shepherding producer on this remake) believes in character. More, he believes, in engaging what the word ""horror"" means."
1,"In this era of torture porn, this film seems intent on reconnecting audiences with the power and intensity of real-life, even quiet and casual creepiness."
0,"What registers now is the simple cruelty of fate, as unlucky coincidences lead to the direst of consequences."
1,"I suspect the movie's sound designers deserve some kind of an award: thanks to them, the damage one can inflict with small appliances and a giant grudge is all too clear."
1,Extremely entertaining if you don't mind being morally corrupted at every juncture.
0,It's that first 30 minutes that ruin this movie.
0,"Boy, words can not express how much I just loathe and detest this movie."
1,"Dennis Iliadis's remake retains its ferocious power and provocative themes, and thanks to a focused script that unfolds in real time, it ratchets up the suspense and sucks us into a remorseless cycle of violence and revenge."
0,A dismal reminder of just how starved Hollywood studios are for good ideas.
0,"The narrative structure is ingenious and sexual assault is at least shown as having dramatic and human consequences of some sort, if only in the context of revenge. Wasn't the original movie enough?"
0,"This clanging cover version believes in nothing, not even its own nihilism, and the horrors it portrays leave us colder, but not wiser."
1,The cast bring a level of reality to this that's surprisingly impressive.
1,Nasty but sometimes effective.
0,"Director Iliadis creates undeniably tense moments in, but the depravity is so gratuitously in-your-face that even a seasoned film critic might baulk."
0,"By dismembering Craven's landmark extremities, Iliadis celebrates his source for all the wrong reasons."
1,Director Dennis Iliadis polishes up Craven's template to a lethal shine.
1,"Olyphant, an actor capable of playing stoic heroes as well as sneering villains, anchors the movie with a believable sense of desperation, and the brief film doesn't waste a second on anything that doesn't bear directly on the crisis at hand."
0,"The Crazies struggles to find novelty and laughs, and must battle the overwhelming sense that we've been here, seen this too often and too recently to experience any real surprises."
1,A beautifully shot film that contains equal measures of style and gore.
1,"Tense, exciting, and occasionally very scary."
0,The problem with The Crazies? Not crazy enough.
0,Director Breck Eisner cranks up the gore to levels that are overpowering and unpalatable.
0,A slicker production than the original but some of the grit is gone.
0,"Without the rotting ickiness of proper zombies, they just seem like methed-out Iowans looking for a fix. That's scary, but not scary enough."
1,It should not be judged for what it is not. But nearly everything about it works.
1,"Eisner and his scenarists (Scott Kosar, Ray Wright) make changes mostly for the better, ramping up the horror factor via tighter focus on the imperiled locals and the requisite hike in gory violence."
1,This spirited yet faithful George Romero remake has the makings of a certified hit.
0,The last thing I need is another Jump Out/ Loud Noise/Alarming Chord Movie.
0,"The blood is certainly convincing these days, but it generally flows only in the safest and most inoffensive, uncontroversial directions."
0,"It devolves to simple run-and-hide cliches, usually accompanied by jarring musical jolts."
1,"A tingler that's cynical and cruel -- it takes it for a given that our government would conspire to kill its citizens, even using Holocaust imagery to sharpen its point."
0,"Romero had quite a lot on his mind, back in the day: Vietnam, the Kent State shootings, a wicked distrust of the military and the Man in general. Eisner has almost nothing on his mind."
0,"If there's a message in all this, it's buried in blood splatter. Which is fine, but makes The Crazies more disappointing than if it had less lofty goals."
0,"The filmmakers seem less clear on what really made those early Romero films great, which is something that, by definition, can't be re-created by any level of loving craftsmanship: They were timely."
0,"Even on the level of killer-virus-gone-wild gore-fest, The Crazies as rejiggered by Eisner is a dud."
0,"There's too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable, The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity."
1,"Hits the traditional horror buttons, while also showing some scary government genocide."
1,Some efficient genre thrills.
1,"It창(TM)s hard to be wowed by films of this stature, especially when there are clich횄 (C)s at every turn and inconsequential characters crop up so opportunely, but go with it; at very worst it창(TM)s still fun for the ride."
0,Here's what I can say for sure about the humanoid attackers in the new version of The Crazies: They're not very interesting.
1,"In the big picture, the government is the bad guy. In the moment, however, the school principal with a blood-drenched pitchfork will do quite nicely, thank you."
1,"The Crazies does what an exploitation movie should: It gets in, it scares you silly, and it gets out, all while playing fair by the audience."
1,"The movie never takes you anyplace truly uncomfortable - for that, you have to go back to the source material. But the new The Crazies still delivers a good, scary horror show."
1,"The Crazies is familiar B-movie fare, but it's also lively fun and presented with well-paced flair. Be sure to watch it in a safe and contained area."
0,Eisner stumbles in playing up an inherent tension that could have given audiences their own case of the crazies.
0,"Nearly every scare in The Crazies is telegraphed, whether by suddenly too-tight photography or shrieky crescendos of sound."
1,The big difference between Mr. Romero's film and Mr. Eisner's -- which is so intelligent you fear the fanboys will scatter -- is that Mr. Eisner never gives us the military's point of view.
1,"This remake of George A Romero's 1973 movie is gross, bloody and savagely effective, with its palette of sickly browns and reds, and the nasty surprises that jump out of clapboard barns and innocent meadows."
1,"Eisner brings plenty of tension and some gratifying scares amid the ordinariness of Main Street U.S.A., clapboard farmhouses and wide fields."
1,"You have to give Eisner points for knowing where all the bodies are buried, and how to unearth them suddenly for maximum effect."
0,"Even for a horror movie, The Crazies is a bore, and we're talking about the most boring genre this side of dysfunctional-family indie drama."
0,"Adapted from horror master George A. Romero's micro-budget 1973 classic, The Crazies delivers some satisfying scares but skims blithely over the darker ramifications of its story."
1,"It's kind of crazy, but it's also pretty smart. And if your nervous system can stand it, you should see it."
1,"Unlike Romero's film, what's missing is a trenchant sense of connection to our historical moment."
0,The incoherence is made all the more disappointing because Eisner displays a great deal of raw talent for the genre's tone and set pieces.
1,[A] respectable update.
1,"While it loses the charm of Romero's low-budget clunkiness, it is in all other regards superior."
0,"It certainly is a valuable introduction to an exciting new talent, but by expanding the film's length, characters and otherworldly environment things are strangely diminished."
1,"In the end, the picture's impact derives mostly from its design and assured execution."
1,Here's the strangest thing of all: it works.
0,"For all the Saturday-matinee heroics, the movie is dreary and monotonous, the vision junky in more ways than one."
0,"Acker has created a fitful combination of beautiful, dreamlike images that never knit together forcefully enough to seem individual or convincing."
1,"The result is never as gripping in narrative terms -- a well-worn litany of dystopian-future chestnuts -- as it is visually, but Acker keeps things moving briskly for the movie's 70-odd minutes."
0,It's too bad the thin story didn't match the stylishly haunting visuals.
1,"Fans of sophisticated, adult-oriented animation may savor Acker's elaborate visuals. Younger children, however, might wonder why they sat through all the terror."
0,"One wonders, in fact, if 9 should have stuck with its original short format."
0,"What's lost in Acker's showdown between diminutive ragdolls and a soul-eating, scarlet-eyed spider-machine is any hint of grandeur, the overarching sense of something of inestimable value at risk."
1,"Acker isn't taking us over the rainbow, but he has brought us someplace daring and new, and he makes you anxious to see what other destinations he has in mind."
1,It would be a shame if the most exciting and thoughtful CGI action movie of the year didn't find an audience because the film's heroes fail to pass the suspiciously high superhero-fitness test.
1,"While children still watching Tigger videos should stay away, older kids will enjoy the bloodless action and awesomeness infused into nearly every frame."
1,"Acker's strange little critters turn out to be oddly endearing, even if you get the feeling this battle has been fought before."
0,A perfect example of a thin idea stuffed and stuffed with filler until it loses much of its charm.
1,"Comparing this to the summer's biggest, most bloated movie about malevolent robots, 9 is about twice as enjoyable with half the length."
0,"Character development is virtually nonexistent, and the action is so repetitive that 9 comes across as unworthy of its visual splendor."
0,"It's too scary for small kids and, frankly, too dreary for everyone else. The most intriguing question it asks is what Acker will do next."
1,What I loved about 9 is how much evident care its makers have put into it.
0,9 reaches the tedium threshold quite quickly.
1,As a late-summer treat for adults with a childlike sense of wonder -- or older children with a grown-up sense of adventure -- 9 is a definite 8 out of 10.
0,"I admire Acker's craftsmanship to the same degree I'm frustrated by what's missing or overstressed here, amid all the rough-textured details and the grim machine-ruled aesthetic."
1,"Every effort to expand the range of feature-length animation beyond the confines of cautious family fare is to be welcomed, and budding techno and fantasy geeks are likely to be intrigued and enthralled."
1,"The expanded cast of creatures looks great, dressed and animated in the homespun style Acker calls ''stitchpunk.''"
1,"It might have been an opportunity for the sort of challenging speculation sci-fi is best at, however, and the best reason to see it is simply because of the creativity of its visuals."
1,The post-apocalyptic adventure 9 adds up to everything except an obvious audience.
1,"Acker, whose gifts for mood, design, and character design are impressive enough to have attracted Tim Burton as a producer, is more of an artist than a storyteller."
1,It signals the arrival of Shane Acker as an audacious new talent to watch.
1,9 is a captivating film with much to say about the human spirit -- even if humans are nowhere to be found.
1,"It's a perfectly functional, fairly scary kids' film, with plenty of craft and creativity to keep adults occupied. But with a story as sophisticated as its visuals, it could have been much more."
1,"Save the voice work, which is celebrity-heavy and mostly undistinguished, 9 is a marvel to take in, especially the individual character designs."
0,It's easy to see why Acker's gifts caught the attention of these directors; he's a visual craftsman of no little promise. Now if he can just stitch together a story with the same loving care that went into creating those digital burlap dolls...
0,[Its] splendid visuals are dragged down by a tedious story.
0,"There's no denying that Acker has a knack for bleak landscapes and an inventive salvage-yard approach to character design, but his narrative skills are less developed."
0,"In movies, our technology is so often the ruin of us. We got that message from Stanley Kubrick way back when, and we get it now. But couldn't filmmakers let something else ruin us for a change? Even the apocalypse needs variety."
1,"The worst thing you can say about 9 is that it's the look, not the script, that keeps your interest."
0,"This film will surely be remembered as an intriguing failure: a triumph of ambition over ability, of ideas over emotional resonance - just another grim fairy tale for these troubled times."
0,"It looks great, but sadly the screenplay - in particular the stultifying dialogue - simply can't match the visual inventiveness."
0,"It allegedly lasts 79 minutes. I think it lasted 79 hours, or 79 years, or perhaps 79 times the space of time between the extinction of allosaurus and the rise of Cro-Magnon."
1,"Where it needs emotive magic, it lays on a vague and maudlin religiosity -- we're never quite sure what Acker thinks he's preaching. 9? I'd give it a 6."
0,The story drifts towards the mawkish without answering any of the big questions it tentatively raises.
0,"A Disneyfied clich챕, disfigured by incoherent mysticism and trite warnings about the dangers of technology."
1,"Gorgeously animated, beautifully executed and incredibly imaginative, Shane Acker's 9 manages to nonetheless feel a little bit like something you've seen before."
1,"Looking like a rag-doll version of Terminator Salvation, the film boasts an arresting visual style."
1,"It's an enchantingly well-done tribute that revives, and even refreshes, our affection for the Stooges, yet at its core it lacks the completely and totally unhinged shock of the new."
1,"There is an appealing nyuk, nyuk nostalgic spirit to""The Three Stooges."""
1,"Pop culture references intermingle with the loopy trio's iconic foolishness, and the result is a movie with some big laughs, plenty of heart and terrible coifs."
1,"Get ready for something more shocking than a poke in the eye: The Three Stooges is genuinely funny, a no-holds-barred, smart-stupid comedy that (at the screening I attended, anyway) will win over Stooge-philes and non-believers alike."
1,"It pleases me to report that the movie is far from a disaster - on a dozen or so occasions, it's even funny."
1,"Peter and Bobby Farrelly's thoroughly enjoyable paean to Moe, Larry and Curly and the art of the eye poke."
1,It's a concept that shouldn't work at all. But - who'da thunk it? - it's better than a hammer to the head.
0,"I spent a lot of ""The Three Stooges"" staring, not laughing. For me this was a stare-out-loud affair."
0,The purpose of the entire enterprise seems to demonstrate the superiority of slapstick sadism from 75 years ago to the wan attempts at PG-rated roughhouse today.
1,"[A] funny, good-hearted resuscitation of Hollywood's beloved lowbrow lunkheads."
0,"The movie is content to simply mimic the old Stooges, bringing nothing new to the table."
1,"Leave it to a sibling comedy duo to recognize the potential for brotherly love amid the Three Stooges' slap-happy antics, adding a welcome heartwarming dynamic to the gang's signature eye-poking, head-knocking routine."
0,"A little nyuk-nyuk-nyuk goes a long way in ""The Three Stooges,"" Peter and Bobby Farrelly's feature-length homage to the classic slapstick comedy trio."
0,"...while a good part of the picture reached my submerged Stooges person and made him laugh, too much of it just didn't connect at all."
1,One of the Farrellys' better films and a movie in which excess -- the hallmark of everyone involved -- is decidedly a virtue.
0,They're mere imitations. There's nothing beneath the surface similarities and programmed franticness.
0,"The Three Stooges isn't very funny, but it is, like last year's far superior The Muppets, a sincere act of fandom on an epic scale."
0,I didn't laugh much.
0,"Any reasonable objections to the Farrellys' Three Stooges will not be on the grounds that it desecrates a revered comedy franchise, but on the grounds that it's not very funny."
0,"If this is a tribute, it's a crass and clumsy one."
0,"For the Farrellys, The Three Stooges is a labor of love. For non-believers, it's merely a labor."
0,"Even by Stooges standards, it's overly juvenile and totally dumb."
0,"You would think that after a quarter-century in development at four different studios, somebody would have figured out how to make a funny movie about the Three Stooges."
1,"The Three Stooges weighs in at about 15 howlers over 90 minutes. Not bad, about the same ratio of hilarity to hokey as the Stooges' old shorts."
0,"The Three Stooges is moronic, stupid, idiotic entertainment for knuckleheads."
1,"The leads acquit themselves in the physical comedy, resurrecting shtick honed on a thousand-and-one vaudeville stages, and recreated in as many playgrounds."
0,The metafriction between these classic dupes and today's idiots chafes uneasily.
1,The movie is so infantile that it achieves a special kind of purity and gentleness.
1,'The Three Stooges' is exactly the film it wants to be. Was it worth ten years of anyone's life? Probably not. Is it worth 88 minutes of yours? Absolutely.
1,"It shows that what made the Stooges work all those years ago, though hardly in vogue, still works today."
0,"The quicker it's forgotten, the better."
1,Quaint but exuberantly crafted.
1,Chase scenes and physical comedy exchanges allow the action to romp along at a fair lick.
1,This could have been a truly awful summation of the work of such minor legends but it works surprisingly well.
0,"This serial-killer procedural is about a West Hollywood slasher who apes Jack the Ripper, but the real crime is the travesty writer-director David Ondaatje perpetrates on Hitchcock."
0,"It takes guts to remake what many believe to be Hitchcock's first masterpiece, but what Ondaatje's done with The Lodger could not be mistaken for ambition."
0,"This strained, empty effort doesn't work as homage or update, and in its darkly violent sensibility has neither the glamour of Brian De Palma's referential nightmares or even the narrative fuel of the serial-killer-obsessed procedurals that dominate tv."
0,"Filled with second-rate Brian DePalma twists, noirishly blurred lights and usually solid actors mouthing potboiler brine, The Lodger resembles bottom-shelf '80s dreck."
0,"A good cast can't save The Lodger, the utterly wrongheaded fourth movie version of a 1910 novel inspired by Jack the Ripper that was most famously filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1926."
0,"What needed to be a taut, structurally sound psychothriller instead malfunctions from the start."
0,"The Lodger is a spooky story ruined by lumpen dialogue, cloddish performances and a director and writer (David Ondaatje) oblivious to both."
0,"The cast works hard to make you believe they believe what the screenwriter tells them to believe. But in the end, it all seems contrived and silly."
0,An artist-in-crisis piece run through a drab but quirk-conscious indie processor.
0,"I can think of no better way to describe Paper Man than the blogger who wrote that the point of this awful movie is ""No matter how immature you are, you can always remain married to Lisa Kudrow."""
0,"Husband-and-wife writer-directors Keiran and Michele Mulroney try to smooth over implausibilities with an intrusive emo soundtrack and ""dramedic"" feints, but the effort is useless."
0,"Jeff Daniels' issues are self-indulgent. But to him, his writer's block and insubstantial life are epic, and the film sides with him more often than not."
0,"An intelligent, meticulously constructed, well-acted movie that has been written to death."
1,"Paper Man is far from perfect, but it holds your interest as a character study because of strong performances by Daniels and Stone."
0,"Married screenwriters Kieran and Michelle Mulroney, who are making their directorial debut, try to wed the peculiar to the poignant and they are irreconcilable."
0,"The quirk-laden indie Paper Man brings together a novelist who won't grow up with a sullen teenage girl for mutual wallowing, eccentric high jinks and life lessons but, unfortunately, little reason to care."
1,Ignore the story of Paper Heart ... Concentrate instead on the delightful performances.
0,"We don't even get a real sense of what kind of writer Richard is, or even if he's any good. It does make a difference, after all, if the novel he can't write is worth writing. A bigger question: Was ""Paper Man"" worth making?"
0,"What we have in this film is a whole lot of nothing, and the little that's there is irritating."
0,A big Twinkie stuffed with indie-film cliches and glazed with chiming emo guitars.
0,"The manipulations characters act out with each other are realistic, even if the overlong and not-nearly-twee-enough comedy built around them isn't, making for a movie whose script may have had more merit than its execution. Or not."
1,"Aided by subtly wounded performances by Daniels and Stone, and a surprisingly affecting comic turn from Reynolds, Paper Man makes up for many of its shortcomings with an abundance of heart."
1,"Not much ""happens,"" though the pic does its best to maintain energy in both physical presentation and mixed-chronology structure."
0,Creation is ultimately disappointing for the opportunity that has been missed.
1,Don't expect anything too radical from this infuriatingly soft yet still pleasantly subdued and poignant screen adaptation of Randal Keynes's book 'Annie's Box'
0,"Bettany himself seems hamstrung by a part that requires lots of concentrated frowns and fey swooning, and the ability to render credible a ridiculous rubber baldy cap."
1,"This gentle, heartfelt and well-acted film about Charles Darwin and his personal agony preceding the 1859 publication of On the Origin of Species does not shy away from the issues. But it personalises them, and places them in a new context."
1,With so much material to draw on it feels slightly disappointing that there's no sense of awe or wonder when the credits roll.
0,A sub-plot features an orang-utan; it is no exaggeration to say that she is the most moving performer on screen.
1,"A sad, searching piece of work about the reluctant labour of a great idea."
1,"The film is beautifully shot and there are dreamy sequences that convey, better than anything I've seen or read, the fantastical, creative quality of Darwin's mind."
0,"As a journey through Darwin's discoveries, Creation fails, although, given the intricacy and the patience of his working methods, it is hard to imagine how such a film might succeed."
0,"Darwin turned the world upside down, but there was more drama seeing Greg Kinnear play the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper in Flash of Genius."
0,"It arrives on the 150th anniversary of the book, and the baroque direction by Jon Amiel is determined that we should live every single minute of it."
1,"The film's attempt to depict challenging and thoughtful material is appreciated, even if the results are mixed."
0,Amiel has reduced a crucial moment in science to a Lifetime weepie about a workaholic who needs personal tragedy to wake him up to his wife's virtues.
0,"After seeing the movie, a sense of insufficiency remains; we feel the need to read additional accounts to truly learn about the man who left such a huge imprint on science."
0,"There are good performances and fleeting moments of exquisite moviemaking, but the experience as a whole is an evolutionary dead end. A dodo this is not, but rather a curiosity -- an aye-aye of a film, or a narwhal."
0,What begins as a multilayered tale of scientific discovery and cultural history gets reduced to a single maudlin idea: that even Charles Darwin had to evolve.
1,"As period dramas go, Creation is quiet and modest, sparse in action and decked out with classy but unassuming costumes and sets."
0,"Its view of life is that a paradigm-shifting breakthrough, rather than being the product of either solitary genius or cultural ferment, amounts instead to a pretext and a substitute for therapy."
0,"For a movie that clearly seeks to bring Darwin to life, Creation spends an awful lot of time wallowing in death."
0,"Although the movie tenderly observes the relationship between father and daughter and has some heart-rending moments, there isn't a lot of doubt why it got made: because actors love to do crazy."
0,"Some questions just can't be answered by science, and the quandary of why Creation is so poundingly dull is one of them."
0,What begins as a drama about the birth of a great notion -- with its attendant battles between the pro and con sides -- instead becomes a dreary melodrama about family grief.
0,"Mr. Bettany is a fine and resourceful actor, but Creation is a battle he was doomed to lose."
1,The film is never less than intelligent and never more than accomplished.
1,"While the film's flashbacks and -forwards are disorienting, the performances give the film propulsion and poignancy."
1,"It's smart, heartfelt, handsome and just mutated enough to sustain interest in a specialized subject."
0,A great moment in the history of ideas does not necessarily make for a great movie.
1,"Jon Amiel, the film's director, tells his story with respect and some restraint, showing how sad and weakened Charles is and yet not ratcheting up his grief into unseemly melodrama."
1,An intriguing portrait of a man and a time that changed everything.
0,"Some good acting and fine cinematography are watered down in a tepid yawner that moves with the speed of natural selection, but without its irresistible sense of purpose."
0,
1,"Guinness is in above-average form, and Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the callous but charming government official with a soft spot for Guinness's daughter."
1,"For those who regard Alec Guinness as the niftiest little con man on the screen, we will guarantee Our Man in Havana to be a source of immeasurable fun."
1,"A real 'winds of change' film, with traditional values crumbling in the heat of pre-revolutionary Cuba. Guinness is wonderful."
1,"Polished, diverting entertainment, brilliant in its comedy but falling apart towards the end when undertones of drama, tragedy and message crop up."
0,"The mixture of mayhem and heehaw is particularly tricky to handle, and not even the sure hand of Director Reed has always achieved a smooth blend."
1,"A doc with the thrust of entertainment, but the content of a thoughtfully researched book."
0,"Although the film's strength is clearly its definitive point of view, this perspective sometimes comes at the expense of a more rigorously objective treatment."
0,"The self-perpetuating cycle of hopelessness, ignorance and poverty is certainly a depressing spectacle. But it's not a very revelatory one."
1,"It's a lot to take in, and Peralta does an admirable job cramming tons of history and insight into his reportage on how the 'hood came to be."
1,The movie feels less like a traditional documentary than an educational video. But it works the way he wants it to: you'll walk out feeling both enlightened and dismayed.
0,"With Crips and Bloods: Made in America, the director Stacy Peralta manages to put a human face on a subject that tends to inspire inflamed debate."
1,"Deals almost entirely in known facts, but it's still a revelatory film."
1,Peralta is a compassionate filmmaker.
0,"Crips and Bloods hasn't been made out of moral anger or a sense of conspiracy. As matters of journalism, sociology, and humanitarianism, the movie is incurious at best. At worst, it's a recruitment video."
0,
0,"Woodley's film mostly floats along on its melancholy drift, so well-attuned to the low-key rhythms of its beaten-down characters that it never quite summons up enough energy for the rest of us, who are along for the ride."
0,"The dramatic payoffs are either nonexistent or overly manipulated, and for a journey that starts with so much deep-set pain and regret to end with a sentimental twist feels, to use a phrase anathema in Carey's world, off-key."
1,"Tennessee veers dangerously ?쮋lose to made-for-TV territory. But you utterly believe the bond between the siblings, and Rothenberg excels in his role of a protective older bro who also happens to be a haunted binge drinker."
0,"The good news for Carey is that she gets to prove she's a pretty decent actress after all. The bad news, of course, is that she's done it in a movie no one has any other reason to see."
0,Two brothers slowly make their way from New Mexico back to their home in Tennessee in a watery indie drama.
0,"As a Texas waitress, Carey is convincing -- more so than the film itself."
1,The good news is that Carey isn't bad.
0,"Tennessee is an earnest, increasingly preposterous road movie about unhealed family wounds and fraternal bonds."
1,"Though Tennessee feels more like a demo reel than a movie, the simplicity of Peck's performance and the naked pain of Rothenberg's are quite affecting."
0,The problem with the film is that it is depressing for no real reason.
0,"It is a brooding, heavy story that has moments of visual beauty, but is ultimately imbued with a permanent glumness."
0,A formulaic indie road drama.
0,
0,"Lower-class rage is addressed in a fashion that most movies -- let alone family ones -- shy away from. Which doesn't make this a good movie, but at least it has something on its mind."
0,"Anyone over the legal voting age will have to suffer through ""valuable"" life lessons to get to the sick two-wheel aerials. Nothing ever comes for free."
0,"The plot of Free Style, lifted wholesale from any number of kid-with-a-dream movies, unfolds just the way you think it will... until the climax turns out to be even cheesier than you feared."
0,"The movie revels in that kind of good-natured, sitcom-style corniness."
1,"If the world truly needs a family-friendly drama built around motocross racing, it might as well be Free Style, a wholly competent film from journeyman director William Dear."
0,"Establishing some rooting interest in an underdog like Bleu's character is essential for movies like this, but not to the point where needless subplots about his mother's relationship with the local sheriff is more vital than putting rubber to dirt."
0,"There are some charming actors in this movie, all dressed up but with no place to go. Free Style is remorselessly formulaic, with every character and plot point playing its assigned role."
0,"Bleu remains one to watch, but only real fans will want to watch this."
1,"Free Style is about motocross and stars Corbin Bleu of the Disney Channel repertory company, two facts that might lead you to expect a certain kind of film."
1,You don't have to be a swooning teenage girl to be enamored of Free Style and its heartthrob actor Corbin Bleu.
1,"As predictable and clich as Free Style is, it moves along briskly enough and Bleu is compelling enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome."
1,A film Barack Obama would approve of screening for Sasha and Malia -- there's even a jab at private health insurers.
0,Bleu's cute-but-bland act flatlines in every scene of a movie with a script that is a perfect match for his abilities.
0,The film is agonizingly slow.
0,"Two hours of knife-wielding and shrieking later, nothing significant or profound is gleaned..."
1,"In roles that could have devolved into arias of melodrama, the cast never overplays its hand, fighting the omnipresent melancholy in small ways rather than large."
1,
0,"There are a few scary moments in the dark. But then there's that image-on-the-retina gimmick, which we can't believe, and a conclusion that's so arbitrary we feel tricked."
1,"Possessed camerawork, elliptical editing, and a discordantly playful score (by Ennio Morricone!) conspire against viewers and establish this as one of Argento's most suspenseful efforts."
0,These are not characters most people can sympathy with. One tends to watch dispassionately as the inevitable plays out.
1,"This simple, classic story is enlivened with well-described characters and credible emotions that make us empathize with the motives and decision of all the characters."
1,"A small, plaintive, modestly made film about how one bad decision can wreck a life."
1,"Unfortunately, the storyfollows too uninvolving a course to make the movie as powerful as it could have been. But that shouldn't stop audiences drawing satisfaction from its textures."
1,A noble entry into the real world of timeless and truly independent American cinema.
0,"Despite the ever-energetic Tony Scott at the throttle, the sleek new edition isn't as transporting as it should have been."
1,"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is an efficiently reworked version of a tense, ticking-clock suspense story."
0,"Travolta's high-tech 21st-century scheme turns out to be not just preposterous but superfluous, demented."
0,"The prevalence of technology also makes the crime itself seem rather archaic. This is the way a criminal mastermind steals millions of dollars today, by hijacking a subway train?"
0,It's a movie that gives you little to ponder and one that's more easily quoted than felt.
1,"There's fun to be had in Pelham, at least for a while, but nothing more than that."
1,"An open-hydrant whoooosh of an action thriller about a hijacked NYC subway train with passengers held as hostages -- a caffeinated update of a 1974 city-on-fire cult classic that cracked wise with a cynical, now nostalgia-inducing, graffiti-era veracity."
0,Scott's redo comes up short in almost every regard against the '74 model.
0,"Not a bad way to pass a couple hours, as long as you don't sit too close to the screen and are inured to a steady barrage of loud dialogue that doesn't bother to be clever."
1,"The new Pelham takes the chilling original premise and modifies it for an era steeped in technology, making for an energetic and engrossing adaptation."
0,"As Ryder's motives begin to reveal themselves, The Taking of Pelham 123 loses its aura of post-9/11 dread, replaced by a muddled commentary on Wall Street greed in these days of raging financial crises."
0,Hiring Tony Scott to direct The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is like hiring Michael Bay to direct My Dinner With Andre: A colossal mismatch of director and material.
1,"It is remarkable how, with all of the advances in technology over the years, a story like this can remain largely unchanged despite a 35 year gap between tellings. By allowing the movie to unfold in real time, Scott enhances the level of suspense."
1,This movie hits you like 600 volts from a sparking third rail. Damn straight it's electrifying.
1,"Like the subway itself, things move by connections, craziness and clockwork in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, a fast and relentless hostage thriller that never stops."
0,"Denzel Washington is that valuable paradox, the relatable supernova. [But] it's too bad the movie around him isn't better -- the '74 edition, propelled by David Shire's incredibly badass theme music, kicks the remake's behind all the way to Coney Island."
0,It's easy to imagine why Pelham's producers wouldn't want Scott's professional but dull picture to be compared with the 1974 classic.
1,"The new Pelham is a solid, suspenseful tale all over again, so long as it stays in the subway tunnels and airless offices of the transit department."
0,"John Travolta's wildly successful post-comeback crusade to become synonymous with crap continues with The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3, Tony Scott's bracingly awful remake/desecration of the classic '70s thriller."
1,Scott keeps things tense while allowing for the occasional blast of humor.
0,"Director Tony Scott may not suffer from attention-deficit disorder, but he is convinced you do."
0,"There's not much wrong with Tony Scott's The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, except that there's not much really right about it."
1,"I can think of worse ways to while away a hot, sticky summer afternoon than ducking into the air-conditioned comfort of the multiplex for a couple of hours worth of jacked-up, seat-rattling, subway-heisting action."
1,"Whereas the original, directed by Joseph Sargent, was essentially a well-oiled B movie, the new incarnation, directed by Tony Scott, is bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over-the-top camera flourishes."
1,The film does what a good hostage negotiator does: It distracts us from what's going wrong and pulls us into the story.
1,"The new Pelham, although no classic, is a lot of fun if you're in the right mood."
1,"We've been waiting too long for a sharp little urban thriller with a couple of tense scenes and one fine, bold performance. Given the time, we'll grab this express train, happily."
0,Helgeland's story is so formulaic and the characters so stock that we're just sitting there waiting for these guys to perform like circus animals.
0,Most disappointing is the new film's reluctance to even attempt to match the ingenuity of the original movie's celebrated one-two punch ending.
1,The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 has all the usual virtues of a good action suspense drama.
0,Pelham is not merely a film that may induce seizures in those who are susceptible; it is a film that seems engineered to approximate the experience of a seizure for those who are not.
1,"It ticks along as efficiently as a new clock. The performances are smooth, the car-crash effects remarkable, the pace never flagging."
1,"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a near-perfect summer entertainment thriller that shows good story, good director and good actors trump gaudy special effects any day."
1,"Kinetic director Tony Scott balances his need for speed and flash with fleshed-out drama, making Pelham the best of his recent outings."
0,"At first it's exciting, but as the film progresses, that quick-cut, never-stop pacing seems increasingly desperate."
1,"Against all odds and better advice, director Tony Scott, screenwriter Brian Helgeland and main protagonists Denzel Washington and John Travolta take a much-loved genre classic and arguably make it better."
1,"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, an energetic updating of the 1974 mass transit thriller, takes account of how much the character of New York has changed."
0,"Most of the film's energy is generated by flamboyant cinematography and music-video cutting, and much of that energy is false."
1,Crisp supporting turns by John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator) and James Gandolfini (as the mayor) combine with plenty of vehicular mayhem to make this a superior diversion.
0,"Like most of Scott's recent films, this one ends in self-indulgent silliness. You end up asking yourself, how do the few fun bits of the film manage to survive in the midst of so much lousy filmmaking?"
0,Can a director be arrested for the attempted hijack of our emotions?
1,Washington demonstrates his really remarkable ability to make us forget he's a movie star and completely believe he's a flawed but noble civil servant.
0,I was really disappointed by this.
0,"'The Taking of Pelham 123' is not a bad film: it's ponderous and shallow, but always watchable. But what it crucially fails to do, especially in the light of its illustrious predecessor, is justify its own existence."
1,"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is not a disaster by any means. For most of its running time, it's a slick, well-crafted piece of entertainment. But you can't help wondering just how good it might have been in the hands of a less self-advertising director."
1,"Head-bangingly hyperactive as ever, action maestro Tony Scott appears to have upped his caffeine intake for this unexpectedly entertaining remake."
0,"The 2009 version, perhaps like New York itself, is flashier and far less gritty. The camerawork is busier, the effects are expensive, the colours louder. The soundtrack, a bastard mix of rocky techno and crude drum 'n' bass, recalls a car ad from 1996."
0,"Juvenile, hyperactive, obstreperous and obnoxious."
0,Tony Scott's remake of the semi-classic of 1974 begins and ends badly.
1,If you like Scott you can argue that too much is better than too little. This movie has a vision and sticks to it.
0,"Compare him with the gang-leader in the 1974 film, played by Robert Shaw as a tight-lipped, ice-cool killer, and Travolta starts to look like a joke."
1,"Mechanical and unspirited, this is just another goddam remake, as they might say in the Big Apple."
0,"In yet another blander-than-bland remake of a classic film, flash-over-substance specialist Tony Scott takes Joseph Sargent's taut, 1974 action-thriller and processes it through the multiplex mulching machine."
0,
1,
0,The original film was far superior and will be remembered in years to come while the current remake will soon be forgotten.
0,"It's doubtful that Obsessed will stick in the popular imagination for more than two weeks, because the movie is borderline ludicrous, and it jams its characters into rigid slots."
0,
1,"Shades of gray? Moral ambiguity? Who needs 'em. Obsessed traffics in catharsis--we aren't here to learn about the human condition, we just want to watch Beyonce tromp a tramp."
0,"As far as the crazy-stalker-chick genre goes, Obsessed isn't horrible. It's just intensely simple-minded."
0,Spends much time spinning its wheels and making auds practically beg for an explanation to all the madness and obsession.
0,"If the producers had done their work properly on Obsessed, I would not now be wishing I could reclaim the two hours I wasted on this tepid, sexless, thrill-free melodrama."
0,"Great-looking actors, glossy locations and a knock-down, drag-out girlfight still don't make Obsessed anything more than a predictable and tawdry Fatal Attraction-style guilty pleasure."
0,"Obsessed takes far too long to get cooking, and it works so hard at not being exploitation that it loses sight of its reasons for existing in the first place."
0,"One doesn't expect a movie of this type to be plausible, but this one stretches the plausibility factor past the snapping point to the unintentional-laughter point."
1,"Obsessed, is short on dimension and subtlety, but it turns into a mess believable enough to keep us invested."
0,"Until Beyonce and Ali Larter duke it out at the climax, this is one dull film."
0,"Obsessed is a safe, dull morality play. The most that can be said on its behalf is that, unlike Fatal Attraction, no bunnies were boiled in the picture."
0,"Obsessed dutifully revises the 'blank from hell' genre which gave the world ridiculous, misogynist thrillers in the mid-1980s and early 1990s."
0,This biracial entry in the psycho-bitch stalker sweepstakes is inept and stupid but not without its base pleasures.
0,Obsessed makes an inadvertent argument for the monastery.
0,"I'd call this stenchcloud 'Fatal Attraction meets The Temp,' but that would insult those movies."
0,More like Delayed Frustration than Fatal Attraction.
0,"Obsessed, a clanking, low-rent imitation of Fatal Attraction, lacks both the original film's imagination and moral ambiguity."
0,Whoever thought remaking Fatal Attraction as a PG-13 thriller was a good idea earns much of the blame for this laughably arch dud.
0,"A silly, contrived film."
0,"Elba and Larter are actually pretty good. Beyonce, through, strikes one note throughout."
0,"A dim reworking of Fatal Attraction, directed with anonymous efficiency."
0,It's execrable; a fist-chewing embarrassment that has no right to a theatrical release.
0,"Idris Elba, so good in The Wire, looks a long way from Baltimore in this overcooked Fatal Attraction-style yarn about a cocksure executive laid low by the office temp."
0,"It could be the least erotic thriller ever made, unless die-you-bitch catfights through broken attic floorboards constitute some sort of kinky subgenre."
0,The best ladies' final to be seen this side of the French Open.
0,Bunny boilers ahoy. This lame and laughable stalker-thriller makes Fatal Attraction look thoughtful.

1,"It is filmed with simplicity, a purity of intent."
1,The great Polish director Andrzej Wajda musters the power of classical filmmaking and personal emotional investment ?쮝o dramatize a stunning atrocity long covered up.
1,"This plays almost like an academic master class, meticulously exploring the event's ramifications but only catching full fire at the end."
1,"Andrzej Wajda has spent much of his long career dramatizing major events in Polish history, and this poignant feature depicts the circumstances surrounding the Soviet Union's massacre of thousands of Polish officers in the spring of 1940."
1,"While never less than fascinating, Katyn alternates between scenes of tremendous power and sequences most kindly described as dutiful. It's as if the artist is never certain whether he is making this movie for himself, his father, or the entire nation."
1,"As a portrait of hell on earth, Katy흦 deserves to be seen by anyone with a feeling for history, however horrifying it may be. Actually, it puts just about every other horror movie to shame."
1,Katyn is a powerful corrective to decades of distortion and forgetting in Polish history.
1,
1,"A gritty political thriller, with a laser-like focus on those moments when Poland was undone by mounting circumstance."
1,Some sequences sear the mind.
1,"A stunning, epic film."
1,"A richly absorbing and intensely painful drama with a tremendous, mostly female cast."
1,"Has sweep and conviction and, most rewardingly, a long-overdue revelation of historical truth."
1,"The great filmmaker's urge to show generations of his countrymen what they were told not to think about is what moves him, and while ""Katyn"" rises above didacticism, you can feel the director keeping his emotions in check throughout."
1,An intriguing mixture of the monumental and episodic...
1,"Katyn is a sobering experience, at times harrowing. It's also extraordinarily compassionate, even as Wajda vents his rage about what happened and the lies that followed."
1,"Wajda's intensity and passion, as well as his intelligence and craft, are unmistakable from the very first sequence. Virtually from the first shot."
1,"The principal success of Wajda's stately, widescreen and exquisitely shot film lies in its sober attempt to mirror the fragmented truth of a genocide."
1,It is serious film-making of the most noble intent and it strenuously attacks the state ideologies that continue to legitimise war crimes.
1,"This powerful, heartfelt and important drama from one of the great names in world cinema deserves to be seen."
1,"Wajda has achieved something truly memorable: the film reminds you that cinema can be the preserver of the truth's smallest details, when a run of excellent pictures can finally tell a story the world was waiting for."
1,"Katyn is a solemn, troubling film that makes necessary demands on its audience."
1,"Wajda employs a full range of sweeping shots and orchestral cues to ramp up the emotion, although he's often guilty of sacrificing the intimacy of character for the grander narrative of history."
0,"Katyn is solidly, skilfully told. But away from these living-graveside scenes, Wajda's own artistic bones seem too well-upholstered at 83."
1,"Though it would be hard to call it life-affirming. It is too riven with grief and horror for that, too aware of what Poland has suffered for it to be anything but a deeply sombre memorial."
1,Katyn is remarkably concise and (if one may say this about a cinematic commemoration of mass murder) elegant.
1,"[Director] Wajda has brought some small measure of rest to their names, to Poland, and to history."

1,"In the bristling and brutal crime thriller Sugarhouse, Andy Serkis delivers a performance that makes his turn as King Kong look like Johnny Vegas's knitted monkey sidekick."
0,"The film, in the end, looks very much like an adaptation of one of those preachy plays that tries too hard to tell it like it is among the underclass."
0,"In Gary Love's determinedly gritty Brit-crim movie, three good actors chase around a script that keeps promising more than it delivers."
0,"What justified filming Dominic Leyton's play Collision is hard to see, but the decisions taken in opening it out are what truly wreck Gary Love's misbegotten attempt to do so."
0,Dominic Leyton's script from his play starts as a flicker of fancy words and ends as a verbose fireball consuming all reality.
0,"Mackintosh's character is a bit sketchy, and his occasional, dramatic interventions were not really believable."
0,"Although the writing's exploration of common humanity across the social divide offers occasional worthwhile moral provocation, its evident theatricality also works against any sense of urban authenticity."
1,"A grimy, rage-filled film. Shame about the middle bit."
0,"Three good actors get hijacked by a talky, pointless script."
1,Increasingly formulaic plotting clouds an otherwise brisk rom-com.
1,"Weather Girl coasts on the charms of its ensemble, which includes brief, funny turns from Jane Lynch and Jon Cryer."
1,
1,"Has a lively, romantic spirit that recalls the playfulness and spontaneity of the French New Wave."
1,"Despite some missteps (a parachute metaphor is particularly belabored), the film has an intoxicating quality."
0,The conventions of contemporary youth culture and cinema could both use a change of sheets.
1,"A lovely, somewhat messy movie about lovely, messy young lives."
1,"Overly familiar but endearing nonetheless, this coming-of-age indie from Alexis Dos Santos is most likely to appeal to those who recognize themselves in the story's lost heroes."
0,"There's real promise in 'Unmade Beds': the photography is luminous, the direction loose but involving, the acting superb. But ultimately it's a joyless, indulgent film about joyless, indulgent people."
1,"An easy-going, garrulous, likable piece."
1,"A keen, scruffy, colourful and buoyant film."
1,"It's refreshing to see a film about youth that doesn't resort to the clichs of drug abuse gone wrong. While its lack of narrative thrust can render it a little too loose for its own good, Unmade Beds still manages to charm and entice."
0,"You could call the film either fresh and charming or hopelessly second-hand. There is, indeed, something there. But not much."
0,"Rumpled, vague and possibly a bit whiffy."
0,"Director Alexis Dos Santos stressed improvisation, and his scenes have a lingering emotional rawness, but the handheld camera work left me feeling as woozy as the characters appear to be."
1,"Emotionally potent performances, gently offbeat humor and writer-helmer Max Mayer's assured touch guide this tender New York love story to a quietly hopeful conclusion."
1,A sensitive but not sentimental story about a romance involving a mentally challenged young man never makes a misstep.
1,The beautifully crafted Adam offers no pat or easy answers to wrenching questions.
1,Hugh Dancy plays a Manhattan engineer who suffers from Asperger's syndrome in this charming romantic comedy.
1,Adam is a most welcome summer treat.
1,"Adam is sweet, meticulous, and, at times, sort of clever, but it's also a not-quite-surprising-enough heartwarming trifle."
1,This is an affirmation that it's still possible to find smart movies about one of the most basic aspects of the human experience: falling in love.
1,A touching and engaging film about a likable and attractive young man who suffers from Asperger's syndrome.
1,"The film is afflicted with a fatal case of the cutes: It's never an encouraging sign when The Little Prince, that eternal touchstone of precious perma-children, emerges as a major motif for a romantic drama."
1,"Adam is a cut above most romances and boasts a intriguing conclusion. One comes away with a sense of hope, leavened by realism."
0,"I'm sorry to report that beyond that educational element and the delicate performances of Dancy and Byrne, I found Adam dramatically limp, predictable and in a curious way even retrograde."
0,"Other than Rose Byrne's on-screen radiance and a soothingly warm palette lit by cinematographer Seamus Tierney, there's not much to get passionate about in this amiable chamberpiece from theater director Max Mayer."
0,"It's hogwash of the highest order, a romanticized take on disability that sees it both as God-gifted higher calling and seductive precoital bling."
1,"Hugh Dancy, so often just a bland safe boyfriend in femme-oriented films, gives an ironically heartfelt performance as the emotionally insulated Adam."
1,"Adam succeeds at getting inside its hero's mind and, more impressively still, gives us entr챕e to his singular soul."
1,Hugh Dancy is really spectacular in this film.
1,"A sweet, atypical love story."
0,"While it's probable that this movie will bring Asperger's to an audience that's never heard of or experienced it, it's also likely to bore them."
1,"To its credit, Adam doesn't go for the cheap, easy solution. In that way, the film shares something of the spirit (and realism?) of (500) Days of Summer: an acknowledgment that not every close encounter, no matter how meaningful, can last forever."
0,"Adam wraps up the story in too tidy a package, insisting on finding the upbeat in the murky, and missing the chance to be more thoughtful about this challenging situation."
1,"Were it not for the fine engaging performances of both Dancy and Byrne, Adam would be sickly sweet."
0,"Written and directed by Max Mayer, this anodyne romantic comedy is as predictable as the alphabet but should hold particular appeal to women whose maternal impulses inflect their mating instincts."
1,The film rides on Dancy's wonderfully authentic performance.
1,"At its best, Adam makes the viewer understand the frustration of living in a world in which everyone is a stranger."
0,"It feels dishonest, which is a problem for a film so interested in truthfulness - especially one trying to reconcile that interest with the demands of a Hollywood romcom."
0,"It's blandly inoffensive but also rather disingenuous, sidestepping the realities of Adam's condition by investing him with a convenient idiot savant gift for astrophysics and the eyes of a puppy."
0,"Despite obvious good intentions, this feels dishonest, and I suspect not very true to life. Worst of all, it risks trivialising mental illness into lovable quirks."
0,"Dancy's Adam is so soulful, droopy and sad-eyed you suspect a misdiagnosis, while Byrne's alarming levels of undernourished passive aggression pass weirdly without comment."
0,Everyone dallies and dithers and radiates well-meaningly. This is mental illness served up for romcom pathos and sentimentality.
0,"A film with so many designs on your affections could never be found surprising, but believe me, it won't stop it from trying and it won't stop you from feeling guilty the moment you realise it isn't working."
1,"For much of its first hour, writer/director Max Mayer's Adam is one of the year's more endearing love stories."
1,"The two of them look terrific together, too -- enough so that you wish someone would cast them together in a much better movie."
1,"It may not be original, but Adam could leave a lump in your throat."
1,"Dancy's eye-opening performance reveals he's a bona-fide acting talent, capable of carrying a movie without ever playing to your affections."
1,"Sure, it's complicated, but isn't that always true of romance? And doesn't it blow the hinges off the universe -- every single time?"
1,"There's no getting around the character's plight as an eternal outsider or the natural sympathy it draws. But writer-director Mayer never loses control of this fact, offering a story that's both sweet and tart, unique and familiar."
1,"Adam is As Good as It Gets with a dash of Rain Man, movie comfort food, but still charms us through the familiar rhythms of its story."
0,
1,"Tyson won't shatter all your preconceptions, but if you don't at least question them, you haven't been paying attention."
1,"Toback steers Tyson through every triumph and disaster you want to hear about, never pretending that the platform belongs to anyone but the man they used to call Iron Mike."
1,"Toback's split-screen moments, in which the film dissolves from gripping memories into something far closer to stream of consciousness, is pure documentary poetry. Hold tight for a guided tour of Tyson's surreal descent into hell."
0,"It's certainly an effectively tough, unsentimental look at boxing."
1,"Up close with a mumbling criminal - sorry, boxing legend - whom James Toback probes for a conscience, finding crazy levels of self-delusion instead."
1,"Like Raging Bull, like On the Waterfront, even like Woyzeck (the granddaddy of lumpenprole tragic drama), Toback's portrait asks us to ransack the human animal to see if there is a soul inside - and if so, of precisely what kind?"
1,It makes for a fascinating film about a man who was drawn by fate into a level of fame and fortune he couldn't deal with and has become a convincing ringside commentator on his own life.
1,"Plainly, this isn't the only account you would need to consult to form a proper picture of the man, but it's a compelling spectacle, to be sure."
1,"The term isn't generally applied to the subject of a nonfiction film, but 'starring' is the right description for Mike Tyson's participation in James Toback's provocatively sympathetic, impressionistic documentary portrait, Tyson."
1,An extraordinary documentary.
1,"An 88-minute stream-of-consciousness monologue that has you by turns sympathetic, perplexed, appalled, and enthralled."
1,"Ultimately, this may be the closest we'll ever get to understanding how Mike feels about himself, and there's value in viewing that assessment."
1,"[Toback] gives us Iron Mike in all his monolithic multitudes and allows us, for a brief moment, to peer alongside him into the existential abyss."
1,You won't know what hit you after watching Tyson. This power punch to the gut is one of the best movies of any kind this year.
1,"The result is as gripping as a title fight and as mesmerizing as a conversation with a cobra. You may not be happy with everything said, but you will not be bored."
1,"Tyson can be brutal with himself, but Toback's fawning documentary lets him off easy."
1,"Although straightforward in format, the film capitalizes on an obviously intense connection between filmmaker and subject with psychological acuity and emotional power."
1,"Mike Tyson is a damaged man but a man nonetheless. Dismissing him as an animal, a habit he sometimes falls into himself, is an error. His mind is far from empty, although it's a lonely, haunted place, and Tyson is a howl of humanity."
1,Who is Mike Tyson? Soft-spoken lost soul? Vicious animal? Not even he knows. But it's eerily fascinating to watch him try to figure it out.
0,A grab bag of occasional split-screens and sometimes overlapping or echoing dialogue -- all of which does more to obscure than illuminate the self-deceiving subject.
1,"Think you've seen enough of Mike Tyson for a lifetime? Think you know as much about him as you want to? Think again, and see James Toback's terrific documentary Tyson."
0,It's a movie that's thought-provoking without being intelligent and candid without being truthful. The same aesthetic choices that [director] Toback seems convinced will set his documentary apart are also what diminishes its credibility.
1,Tyson is worth seeing even if you have no particular interest in the sport or the man.
1,
1,"It isn't a profile; it's a conduit for Tyson to speak his mind. He's the film's only voice, but even when he's the only one talking, the story is still two-sided."
1,It makes you look at him in a new light.
1,"My hunch is this innovative documentary will make you look at Mike Tyson differently. Not necessarily in a better light, but in greater context."
1,"Tyson is terrifically compelling and, more than that, unexpectedly moving."
1,"James Toback's Tyson is a documentary with no pretense of objectivity. Here is Mike Tyson's story in his own words, and it is surprisingly persuasive."
1,"Those who were furious at Tyson will be made even angrier by Toback's film, for here is a fresh provocation-an attempt to restore to Tyson the human dimensions that have been taken from him (by himself, of course, as well as by others)."
1,"Deploying multiple split screens and a discreet but effective score, Tyson is hugely engrossing at the same time that it is not entirely credible."
1,"More a testimony for the defense than a documentary, it's a sympathetic portrait of a complex man driven by an anger that still bubbles beneath the surface."
0,Hypnotic and ultimately incomplete.
1,"Toback, to his considerable credit, turns that view around by showing Tyson as a complicated person who has more thoughtful things to say."
1,"With Tyson, [director James] Toback has found a documentary subject as tragic and ridiculous, as bizarre and driven, as the heroes of his other films."
1,Toback fashions a sharp doc out of a blunt object.
1,"When Tyson finally admits defeat and announces retirement, it's those crinkly, hurting eyes you remember."
1,The closest most of us will ever come to an intimate chat with the champ.
1,A revealing portrait of the troubled Mike Tyson elicits horror and sympathy.
0,Something of a clich.
1,"I can't say I've ever wanted to be in Mike Tyson's head, but this documentary by James Toback certainly took me there, and I won't soon forget it."
1,"Listening to Tyson tell his side of the story, you come to understand him with new depth and complexity."
1,"Some documentaries grow in the shadows; others demand to be made. The story of boxer Mike Tyson, powerfully recounted in a new film, is as rich as a Dickens novel."
1,"The most remarkable revelation of the movie is its subject's thoughtful, reflective eloquence and unflinching self-perception...Tyson may or may not be entirely who he says he is, but he's probably not who we thought he was, either."
1,"It all adds up to a fascinating psychological study, a film that goes beyond both the public persona and the fighter's own spin to get at the frightened, angry, explosive, yet utterly understandable boy who became a very troubled and very public man."
0,"Half-appealing, half-pathetic."
1,There is something compelling about the way he presents his version of the stories and scandals that surround him.
0,Just relentless lisping monotonous speech that makes the prospect of entering the ring with Mike seem attractive if only because it will be over sooner.
1,
1,"Something draws us near-perhaps [James] Toback's own fascination, at once self-serving and empathetic, with his soft-spoken protagonist."
1,"The result is a documentary that once again highlights that, of all sports, boxing is the one that cinema has been most successful in recording..."
1,"Never does anything feel forced or contrived. Life, as this memoir reminds, can offer plenty of drama that need not abide by fictional formulas or genre conventions."
1,"The pain of divorce and the tragedy of a parent's death supply the raw emotional materials of The Boys Are Back, making it all the more impressive that director Scott Hicks steers clear of the maudlin and the manipulative..."
0,"There's nothing terribly wrong with this leisurely paced chronicle of a single father's struggles parenting his two sons, but there's nothing terribly right with it, either."
1,"OK, it sounds like a tear-jerker, and sometimes it drifts dangerously close. But Owen, in a heartfelt, award-caliber performance, never goes soft. It's his core of toughness that makes the movie so funny, touching and vital."
1,"With those piercing eyes, Owen makes a lovely, soulful Joe, of course. But it's not the nice papa we want to understand here, it's the unapologetically naughty one."
1,"The content of Allan Cubitt's script, based on Simon Carr's memoir, is meaty and straightforward, which gives it an unexpected power."
0,"Carr's original anecdotes don't supply much storyline, so Hicks spans the gaps with golden-lit montages set to Sigur Rs. They're a great advertisement for Australian vacations. And vasectomies."
0,"Owen brings insight and honesty to this otherwise by-the-numbers adaptation of Simon Carr's memoir, which director Scott Hicks bathes in shimmering golden tones as if the characters lived at the end of the rainbow."
1,"Mr. Owen plays all the colors and emotions of the parenting dilemma with a probing wit and a sense of humanity that are thrilling to watch. Roguish yet vulnerable, he gives a performance that is both rough-hewn and gently nuanced."
1,"What you can't see with your mind's eye, however, are the performances, which save the movie from a treacly inevitability."
1,"On the tougher side are Allan Cubitt's script, which is good-natured but doesn't idealize any character, and the prickly honesty of Owen's performance."
0,"The problem is that the movie always takes the easy way, scattering a few heavy, confrontational scenes among acres of picturesque montages."
0,"In spite of the fine lead performance, Back is a grey, unedifying slog from grief and hopelessness to parental semi-competence."
1,"The Boys Are Back is not a perfect movie -- but you can't do much better than Owen, who beautifully plays against his darkly brooding persona."
1,"Shot in the glorious golds and greens of South Australia's autumn, it's a convincing tale of spiritual and emotional rehabilitation, perhaps not as important as it wants to be, but not exactly a waste of time, either."
1,"The Boys Are Back is a bit like the parenting it portrays -- at times there is pain, mistakes will be made, but if you can get beyond that, there is pleasure to be found."
1,This lovely and emotionally resonant film about a family shattered by grief deserves better than a forgettably glib title that conjures up images of beer brawls or gangster affiliations.
0,"It sounds like the start of a Neil Simon sitcom, or some Dennis Quaid movie for Disney, with Rene Russo sweeping in during the second act to bring some order. Actually, that might have been okay. At least it would have had a few jokes."
1,Honesty defines the performances. The happiest possible ending here and in real life is that people keep going forward no matter how hard it hurts.
0,I didn't think there was a minute of truth in this thing.
1,"You may well cry -- I did -- at The Boys Are Back, but Hicks doesn't use hammers or harp strings; the emotion is honest and earned."
1,"All told, the movie's a solid entry in the Bad Dad Gets It Together genre and Owen is really quite touching, especially when he's not trying too hard, which is most of the time."
0,"The film seems to regard Joe with affection, and Owen certainly portrays him as a nice man. But why are his unformed theories about bringing up Artie supposed to fill us with affection and sentiment?"
1,Clive Owen was spared the role of James Bond. And The Boys are Back is an example of why we are all the better for it.
1,A substantial performance from Clive Owen rescues what might otherwise have been a fairly gooey fatherhood drama.
1,"Relationships -- between men and women, fathers and sons -- are more complicated in real life, and The Boys Are Back deftly acknowledges that fact."
1,"Owen, who doesn't get many roles like this but should be signed for more, brings a compelling and sturdy realism to Joe, making him likable but not insufferable."
1,"A classy, intelligent, low-key affair and a fine reminder of what's really essential to most lives: family."
1,"It manages to veer from touching to humorous (Warr has some rather unconventional parenting techniques) without being overly mawkish, and the sumptuous cinematography by Greig Fraser is perhaps the best commercial ever for South Australia."
0,"The Boys Are Back is based on a true story, and not in a good way. It's obviously true; otherwise why would anyone think it's worth telling a story so trivial?"
1,"If The Boys Are Back takes some emotional shortcuts, it still manages to convey some of the more mystifying aspects of parenthood."
1,"Owen, not chasing Julia Roberts or anyone else for a change, is pleasant enough making this 100-minute argument for unconventional parenting."
1,There's a lot to like about the film. Hicks makes evocative use of the Fleurieu Peninsula's hills and coastline to impart some magic to Joe's attempts to turn life with his sons in to a Boys' Own adventure.
0,"As the film grapples with the tension between the ideals of parenthood and the realities, the script fumbles some key moments."
1,"This beautifully etched, deeply moving drama about single fatherhood [is] the best film Adelaide director Scott Hicks has made since Shine -- and the peak of Clive Owen's acting career"
1,Hicks's directing style is straightforward and unfussy - a description you could apply to this big-hearted film as a whole.
0,"Aggressively life-affirming, unashamedly sentimental and tear-jerking with industrial efficiency."
0,"If you could order a heart-tugging movie about a widower single dad from the Boden catalogue, accessorised with emotional moments purchased online at johnlewis.com, it might look like this excruciatingly artificial and prettified film."
1,Hicks's hand with these relationships is more than sure enough to guide this unexpectedly observant movie over its occasional rough spots.
1,The Boys Are Back strains admirably against the stereotypes which tend to weigh down such tales of the expected.
1,"The film is a convincing portrait of the stress of single parenthood. Owen does well in a tricky role. I could watch him all day, and after The Boys Are Back, I felt like I had."
0,"Owen's voiceover is a cringeworthy accompaniment on the film's heavily signposted road to redemptive hugs and Joe's tentative romance with a divorcee. Bereavement is a valid starting-point, but this really gives the healing process a bad name."
0,"The Boys Are Back is frightened of being frightening and, as a result, has no sense of momentum."
1,"While not rising to the status of first rate, Boys Are Back is interesting and worth seeing."
0,"Despite an A-list star and a high-tech plot, the film itself feels like a hybrid of silly science tingler and moral philosophy with a straight-to-video sheen-which is likely where their larger profit margins lie."
1,"Benefiting significantly from the casting of Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley, director Vincenzo Natali's outlandish sci-fier sustains a grotesque and funny fascination throughout its slightly protracted runtime."
1,"Splice went down smooth, with its sleek surfaces, terrific special effects and disturbing sexiness."
1,"The outstanding creature effects by Howard Berger only get more astonishing as Splice splits into an eerie horror picture, then divides again into something out of Rosemary's Baby."
1,"The detailed imagining of Dren's life cycle and Splice's one-upping make the movie mortifyingly fascinating, and its spell lasts right up until the junk heap of a grand finale."
1,Genre-savvy monster movie approaches Midnight Movie zone without abandoning the mainstream.
0,"Despite its relative bravery in choosing not to embrace the Grand Guignol, Splice is a little too hit-or-miss to truly work."
0,"The creature effects are terrific, but the human protagonists aren't nearly so interesting, and the don't-mess-with-nature message is too hoary to be made interesting with this feeble setup."
0,"Morphing as often as the character central to its story, Splice is an unruly mix of science, morality, family dysfunction, horror and finger-down-the-throat gross-out ridiculousness."
0,"It begins with such promise, a kinky modernist twist on a classical sci-fi morality tale. That it degenerates into conventional, genre horror is all the more disappointing."
0,"The movie doesn't work, but the sets and CGI effects are fascinating, and the actors carry on like they're in some kind of meaningful futuristic experience of lasting value."
1,"If you've seen Species, you know where this don't-mess-with-Mother-Nature horror show is going, though director-cowriter Vincenzo Natali has a few interesting twists up his sleeve."
0,"However somber it gets, it's never truly thought-provoking, and however outrageous it gets, it's still always 20 minutes behind the audience. It's just too dumb to be serious and too slow to be entertaining."
0,"Though a stylish thriller with an initially palpable sense of menace and kinky tension, the story takes such ridiculous turns that it ends up undercutting its initial promise."
1,"The Cronenberg influence here is evident in Mr. Natali's interest in the body and birth and in an initially subdued, near-narcoleptic atmosphere that helps build a nice sense of foreboding."
1,"Before the film devolves into clich챕, director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali creates a potent and provocative thriller about gender politics and human impulses that can't be reduced to a science."
1,"The movie is ridiculously over the top, inelegant and so defiantly ?쮋razy??that it works, reminding you how fun gore and creatures that go bump ??and??grind) in the night can be."
1,"The special effects and creature design, as good as they are, don't exceed the acting by Polley, Brody and Chan챕ac, who make it all seem entirely plausible and emotionally real."
1,"Splice is a hybrid that works. It's a smart, slickly paced, well-acted science-fiction cautionary tale-horror movie-psychological drama."
1,"While it's far from perfect, it's a timely and well-considered thriller about the scarier aspects of genetic engineering."
1,"Splices together the mad-scientist story with a satire of modern marriage and parenting. While the results are mad, brazenly unethical, and occasionally funny, the implications are deeply upsetting."
1,"If it's discouraging -- or at least disorienting -- to see that Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley have signed on to a gnarly work of science-fiction horror, lighten up. They have good taste in schlock."
1,"Shooting with a cool reserve and a steely-blue color palette, Natali keeps the film unsettling by using icky creature effects, but just as often by offering up grotesque caricatures of real-life parenting discomforts..."
1,"The movie carves out its own psychological terrain, pondering the emotional storms of both childhood and parenthood as relations in the little family grow ever more perverse."
0,The climax is a pileup of sorts as the movie suddenly becomes an audience-pandering monster-in-the-woods creature feature.
1,"The film, much of which takes place in laboratories or at the couple's isolated farmhouse, doesn't deliver ""the usual."" I was fine with that -- grateful, in fact. A little queasy in the stomach, but grateful."
1,The script blends human psychology with scientific speculation and has genuine interest until it goes on autopilot with one of the chase scenes Hollywood now permits few films to end without.
1,"A good horror flick always does metaphoric battle with our interior demons, and Splice summons them in impressive numbers."
1,"Daring, disturbing and deliciously twisted."
1,What makes Splice morally compelling isn't the bioethics quandaries it raises so much as the way it delves into parenthood.
1,"An engrossing, if flawed, techno thriller that never quite goes where expected, and that's what makes it such a pleasant surprise."
